37,Innovation development,2023,"Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets","Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.",0,Gender,,"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Worksheet Descriptions  Unnamed: 1               Unnamed: 2                                                                                                                                                                    Unnamed: 3                                                                                                                                                                                Unnamed: 4

 1. Introduction  
 
Brachiaria ( Urochloa  spp.) and Panicum grasses ( Megathyrsus  spp.) are two important 
tropical forage species indigenous to Africa that are widely cultivated in Africa, South America, 
Australia and East Asia and have demonstrated success in transforming beef and dairy 
industries. They are perennial, fast growing wit h high biomass production potential, palatable 
and nutritious to livestock. They possess large root systems, fix carbon in soils, and are 
adapted to drought and a wide variety of soils, tolerant to shade, waterlogging and to pests 
and diseases. Brachiaria and Panicum grasses are extensively used for grazing, cut -and-carry, 
and silage and hay production. Improved cultivars are high yielding, responsive to fertilizer 
applications, persistent and can remain green long into the dry season.   
 
Multi-locational a gronomic and farmer participatory evaluation of the performance of 
resilient and drought adapted forage cultivars and hybrids will identify best options for the 
different regions and livestock systems in the country. Validation at farmers’ fields (e.g., as  
part of Farmer Field Schools) will increase awareness and provide information of the impact 
on animal productivity and environmental indicators. Seed availability will be increased by 
seed multiplication by government institutions (such as IER), private s ector and farmers. This 
will lead to an increased adoption of these materials and improve productivity and income of 
households keeping small ruminants.  
This report presents the preliminary results of the forage trials in Mali  implemented by 
l’Instititut d’Economie Rurale (IER ) as part of the CGIAR Research Initiative on Sustainable 
Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender inclusion (SAPLING) . 
 
Key elements:  
• Resilient and drought adapted forage cultivars and hy brids  (Urochloa , Megathyrsus , 
Crotalaria, etc) for their scaling up.  
• Evidence of improved forages and food -feed varieties and ‘food rations generated”.  
• Training for forage seed producers

 2. Methodology  
 
Treatments and experimental design  
 
The initial evaluations of forage cultivars are carried out at three sites:  
1. Barouéli (Ségou region) , rainfall 500 mm. from June to September  
2. Farakala (Sikasso region) , rainfall 1000 mm, from May to September  
3. The IER Research Station (Sotuba , Bamako ), rainfall 750 mm, from May to September  
 
The performance of forage species/cultivars is also  assessed by the farmers and other 
stakeholders visiting the experimental plots at different stages (e.g., at establishment, full 
vegetative stage and maturity), and  the preferred technology will be identified for on -farm 
evaluation as outreach research activities.  
 
Number of treatments : 11 improved forage cultivars and hybrids, and 2 local forages.

 Management  
 
• Sowing: At onset of rains (direct seeding ), July 2023  
• Basal F ertilizer :  Fertilizer was applied at the rate of 100:60:30 kg N: P 2O5: K2O / ha.  
• Top dressing fertilizer: After 12 weeks after the establishment, nitrogenous fertilizer  was 
applied  at a rate of 100 kg N/ha in two equal split doses.  
• The weeds were removed manually from the plots.  
• No control of p ests and diseases  takes place . 
 
Data collection  
 
The following data are collected:  
• Rainfall, temperature (mean maximum and minimum) and relative humidity data in 
monthly basis from the nearest meteorological station for entire experimental period.  
• To maintain uniformity on the initial growth among forage species/ cultivars tested 
perform standardization cut at six weeks of germination by cutting 5 cm above the ground 
level.  
• Plant population : Plants are counted  within a 1m x 1m frame, randomly place d over the 2 
central rows at 4 weeks interval during establishment phase and at 8 weeks interval during 
the production phase.  
• Plant height : Similarly measure the height of 4 plants within the 1 x 1 m frame at the same 
interval as tiller numbers above.  
• Pest s and diseases : Assess pests and diseases incidences and record data every month 
throughout the experimental period. It is advisable to take the digital photographs of pest 
and diseases in each forage species /cultivars.  
• Dry matter yield : The first dry mat ter yield is taken at maturity from 2 x 2 m2 net harvest 
area per plot, harvested fresh material  is weighed  and sub-samples are collected and dr ied 
at 105oC for 48 hours for dry weight determination. Subsequent harvests are conducted 
after every 8 weeks.  
• Analysis of nutritive values : Each forage species/cultivar evaluated are subjected to 
nutritive value analysis including Crude Protein (CP), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid 
Detergent Fiber (ADF), Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL), Metabolizable Energy (ME), A sh, 
Calcium (Ca), Phosphorus (P) and others. For this purpose, herbage collected from 8 weeks 
harvest in wet and dry season of a year is used.

 3. Results  
 
The following table s show pictures of the three different research sites taken in the same 
week of 18 December 2023 and five months after planting.  Differences between the different 
sites are considerable, especially but not surprisingly between the Barouéli site on the one 
hand and the Farakala en Sotuba sites on the other.   
 
Barouéli  Farakala  Sotuba  
   
Andropogon gayanus  
Performing well in both Farakala (ranked 6th by farmers) and S otuba, regular in Barouéli  
 
  
  
 
Crotalaria juncea  
Not performing well at any of the sites , ranked last in Farakala . We saw the same at the Ghana 
sites whereas at the Senegal sites the C. juncea performed very well. At the Sotuba site a local 
Crotalaria  showed good performance. According to literature, soil type and Ph should not be a 
constraint, but low soil fertility (P) might be a main cause for the poor performance in Mali and 
Ghana, Senegal  site probably having higher soil fertility because of residual nutrients from former 
crops.

• This report  is entirely based on visual observations and farmers  evaluations. A second 
report with the  analysis of the  agronomic data will be made available early 2024.  
• The observations and farmer evaluations were conducted  at five months after planting 
and approximately two months into the dry season.  They will be repeated in approx. 
three (mid dry season) and six months (end dry season).  
• In the drier region (Barouéli) the Bracharia/Urochloa gras ses are preferred over  the 
Panicum / Megathyrsus materials , whereas the more humid region (Farakala ) shows the 
opposite . This might change as the dry season progresses  and the Panicum grasses are 
likely to also suffer more in the more humid zone.  
• There see m to be good p erspectives for some of the hybrids ( especially Cobra, Talisman, 
Camello ). Farmers like their adaptation to drought and, in particular for Cobra, their 
suitability for use as a cut -and-carry feed.

Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs 
and linked households for testing 
delivery of bundled technology packages 
in Tanzania  
James Rao, Immaculate Omondi, Jane Poole and Amos Omore
Key messages
• Designing and conducting the selection of 
agripreneurs and households to test delivery of 
bundled technology packages is complex given the 
many factors that need to be considered.
• Statistical matching technique was used to select 
agripreneurs (APs) and consequently leading to the 
identification of households that were likely to be 
linked to the APs and to producer organizations 
where the APs operated.
• The complexities of the selection of APs and 
households should be factored into the analysis 
as much as possible following an endline survey 
to include measuring the effect of Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of a 
technology package or a combination because 
different agripreneurs take up different baskets of 
interventions in different areas.Introduction
Maziwa Zaidi partners identified a set of integrated 
intervention packages (Omore et al. 2019) to be 
tested and delivered as part of the implementation 
of the project on ‘Agri-entrepreneurship, technology 
uptake and inclusive dairy development in T anzania.’ 
The testing and delivery were through empowered 
and appropriately skilled agripreneurs (APs) who were 
expected to also profit from promoting the uptake of the 
prioritized technology packages by smallholder dairy 
farmers linked to them. 
To achieve this aim, the capacity of the APs would be 
strengthened in selected agribusiness knowledge 
areas and skills by incubation service providers. This 
intervention included gender-responsive incubation, 
acceleration, training and mentoring of APs engaged 
in the provision of inputs and services in project sites.

|       Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in TanzaniaFollowing the capacity building, changes in behaviour 
among APs in relation to the delivery of services would 
be monitored in both intervention and control districts 
and wards qualitatively and quantitatively . Qualitative 
monitoring of outcomes would be conducted through 
knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) analysis 
guided by a theory of change developed at the onset. 
Quantitative monitoring would be done through 
baseline and endline surveys of APs and households  
to capture changes in the use of inputs and services by 
HHs linked to the capacitated APs.
This research brief summarizes 1) the methodology 
including the process of selecting APs and HHs and 
2) the results of the selection process. The selection 
process is summarized based on the baseline data 
available at this portal: Maziwa Zaidi/More Milk in 
T anzania (phase II) - Datasets - ILRI Datasets Portal .
 
This intervention included gender-responsive 
incubation, acceleration, training and mentoring of 
the agripreneurs engaged in the provision of inputs 
and services in project sites. The project sites were 
selected based on the need to align with ongoing 
development projects that could facilitate the 
uptake of technology packages  in Kilimanjaro and 
T anga regions of T anzania .
Methodology
Two regions, namely Kilimanjaro and T anga and 
four districts within them (Hai, Siha, Korogwe and 
Muheza) were selected based on the need to align 
with ongoing development projects that could 
facilitate the uptake of technology packages. Within 
each intervention, districts are wards with cattle 
keepers linked to the APs. The selected wards 
are geographically clustered around producer 
organizations (POs) also linked to the APs. Two 
control districts (Moshi Rural and Rombo) with similar 
production and market systems were also identified, 
both in the Kilimanjaro region. Project wards were 
identified by the overlap between the geographical 
catchment of cooperatives/POs and the geographical 
areas from where the project selected APs to draw 
their clients. From these overlapping areas, a random 
selection of wards was made. These are the project 
implementation areas. The selection of APs and HHs 
was carried out in three stages: scoping, selection of 
APs and identification of target HHs (Figure 1).Figure 1: Sampling of agripreneurs and households in treatment and 
control districts.
Stage 1: Scoping  
A scoping exercise was done in October and November 
2020 across the six districts to generate an initial long list 
of all APs in project sites and their networks, including 
the POs/cooperatives that they work with. Sampling 
was informed by the need to have enough to cover 
the diversity of APs and have a sufficiently long list from 
which to select about 50 APs across certain criteria in 
both intervention and control areas. The scoping relied 
on key informant interviews and a snowballing approach 
to generate the long list. 
A total of 57 key informants (mainly ward extension 
officers) and 51 respondents from POs were interviewed, 
through partners in the project implementation area. An 
expanded list of APs was generated from the interviews 
and further snowballed to identify all the APs in the project 
implementation site. This was done by first interviewing 
the identified informants and respondents, to generate 
information on APs in the area, then interviewing all the 
identified APs from the snowball sampling interviews.
 
From the 57 key informants and 51 respondents from 
POs, names of APs operating in the study sites were 
obtained and further names were generated from 
interviewing each of the identified APs from the list. This 
snowball sampling process generated a list of 427 APs. 
Out of this list, the goal was to interview all the listed APs 
who operated within the project implementation areas. 
Since the broader list contained some APs who operated 
outside the area and some who were unavailable due 
to changing their area of operation or other reasons, in 
total, 291 APs were interviewed.
The survey , using a structured survey tool, collected 
minimum data for characterizing these agripreneurs. Data 
on type of enterprises, gender of the entrepreneur, area 
of operation, products and services offered and training 
needs, was obtained. The data generated from the 
scoping survey was used to inform the second stage of 
the selection of those who would be invited to participate 
in the intervention or be part of the control group.

Initial data from the scoping study was used for the 
selection of intervention APs. The 291 APs were first 
scored based on the criteria listed below, including 
abbreviations in the data portal.
1. Type of business and level of bundling (breeding, 
animal health, agro-dealer, feed supplier, etc.)
2. Linkages that APs have with POs/cooperatives or 
overlap between the PO and AP at the ward level 
(AP_PO_overlap)
3. Scale of operation – clientele and the geographical 
location of most of their clients: 
• Number of wards covered by the AP ( ward 
rate )
• Service x product bundling 
(serv_prod_bundle )
• Total number of services ( prod_rate )
• Total number of products ( serv_rate )
4. Other characteristics:
• Gender ( AP_gender ),
• Age ( AP_youth )
These variables (highlighted above as they appear in 
the data portal) were used to score all APs and then 
in selection of the APs from the intervention districts 
that would be invited to participate in the incubation 
program. The baseline for APs was, however, 
conducted with all 291 APs in both intervention and 
control districts.

Each AP was scored on each criterion as summarized 
in T able 1, with a summation of scores across criteria 
yielding the AP selection score. This resulted in scores 
ranging from -4 to 5 with a score of 5 indicating high/
advanced level of business operation. T able 2 below 
shows how the APs were distributed across scores.T able 2: Distribution of APs by selection scores and intervention

About 50 out of the 193 APs in intervention districts 
were targeted for selection into the incubation program 
(a longer list of 60 per group was initially generated to 
allow for non-responses following a consent process). To 
ensure that APs of different business levels were selected 
while also targeting youth and women entrepreneurs, 
the targeted 60 APs were distributed across the different 
scores as shown in T able 3. The allocation per score is 
proportionate (approximately 30%)   to each score’ s 
representation in the distribution of the 193 APs in the 
intervention districts.

Given the foregoing, in March 2021, the CGIAR Research 
Program on Livestock (CRP Livestock) technology flagships 
comprising inputs/services groups (Animal Health, Feeds 
& Forages, and Genetics) were guided to use the data to 
select APs in the intervention  group who they thought 
would benefit from the incubation program and achieve 
improved inputs/services and project goals based on a 
given criterion developed from analysis of the scoping 
data. This was done mainly to ensure that selected APs 
cut across different business levels and avoided deliberate 
bias towards including women and youth.

|       Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in TanzaniaDuring the visit to the wards, a list of non-cooperative 
HHs keeping dairy cattle was also compiled and 
combined with the list of cooperative members to 
generate a comprehensive list of dairy HHs in the wards. 
Finally , dairy HHs in the selected wards were selected 
(including non-cooperative members where possible) 
and surveyed. These dairy HHs represent the target HH-
level population for the project.
Results 
T able 4 shows how APs offered for selection are 
distributed across the scores. The aim was to ensure 
that selected APs as per the Livestock CRP flagships cut 
across different business levels, adhering to the women 
and youth representation as indicated. We targeted 
having about 50 APs for incubation, with an additional 10 
APs to start with in case of dropouts or lack of willingness 
to participate. 
T able 5 summarizes the selection of APs by district, 
including additional APs in case of dropouts or 
unwillingness to participate in incubation. It shows the 
distribution of the 60 APs across the different scores of 
levels of the business scale. The 60 APs were invited to 
participate. Finally , 50 participated in the incubation 
process including visioning, boot camp, mentoring and 
coaching.

The HH survey interviewed 713 HHs from 24 wards 
(12 intervention and 12 control) where there were 
cooperative and non-cooperative HHs (in some cases 
we could not get the non-cooperative or the cooperative 
members). The distribution of HHs by ward and district is 
shown in T able 6.

After identification of matched APs in both intervention 
and control areas, the POs/cooperatives linked to them 
were listed. If not already obtained, data on cooperative 
members and their wards was collected. Wards were 
identified around the POs/cooperatives that represent 
common areas of both APs’ coverage and POs/
cooperative members. It is useful to note that not all APs 
were expected to be linked to these POs/cooperatives, 
but the majority are expected to be linked. Those not 
linked are likely working in the same geographical areas. 
These wards of overlap between PO membership and 
AP operation formed the longer list of wards, from 
which a random selection of survey wards was drawn. 
The wards had to have at least eight APs who indicated 
they work in them or at least one PO operating in the 
area (three wards in Rombo were excluded because 
there were no reported POs covering the areas). These 
became project implementation areas. The number of 
wards was balanced according to the HH-level sample 
size calculations during analysis (see below).

ilri.orgDiscussion and next steps
Designing and conducting a social experiment like this 
one presented here is complex given the many factors 
that need to be considered. The complexities will need 
to be factored into the analysis as much as possible 
following an end-line survey . At a basic level, the analysis 
would include measuring the effect of the Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of technology 
package or a combination given the expectation that 
different APs will take up different baskets of interventions 
and that in control areas, APs may have single or 
combination of interventions which may or may not be 
the same. Similarly , there are APs in the intervention areas 
(but not with the project) who may have the same or 
other single or combination interventions and through 
the project may also receive information from their fellow 
project agripreneurs. 
The analysis will also need to consider the likelihood that 
we likely will be unable to evaluate effectively different 
baskets (or individual) technologies and their effects 
but expect to see quite a lot of variation which may be 
explored to look for trends and comparisons. There 
may also be different technologies in control areas than 
in intervention areas because of the actions of partners 
and/or government extension services. Further, we would need to factor observations of 
non-project agripreneurs in intervention districts to 
evaluate the effect of BDS without the confounding of 
technology . Another potential complication is measuring 
and isolating effects on farmers in intervention areas 
who are reached by other non-project APs that are not 
supported with BDS. It is very likely that we will have HHs 
in the project who indicate in the baseline that they are 
working with APs, but who are not part of the project. 
We will explore these issues while analysing the baseline 
and end-line data to deliberately extract these APs. The 
evaluation will also incorporate the parallel qualitative 
assessment of outcomes being conducted separately .
