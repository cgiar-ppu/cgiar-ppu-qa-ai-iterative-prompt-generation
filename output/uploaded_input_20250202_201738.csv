FORWARD
“Training of Trainers Guide to Improving Child Health and Nutrition through Diets, Feeding and Hygiene Practices” has been prepared under various projects implemented by International Potato Center (CIP), Bangladesh. In the future, we want to use Community Nutrition Scholars (CNS) to train mothers using this training guide. In our country, mothers, children, and adolescents are mostly victims of malnutrition; with this training, we aim to provide information about nutritious and healthy food specifically for them.
The aim of this training is to cultivate potatoes without traditional farming, to enhance agricultural development by cultivating orange-fleshed sweetpotato and vegetables in home gardens, easy access to vegetables and variety of nutrients in vegetables increases tendency to eat promoting healthy eating habits and helps to learn techniques of cooking process while maintaining quality of nutrients. Through this guide awareness on nutritional value of potatoes, orange-fleshed sweetpotatoes and sweetpotato vines will be increased, as well as awareness on the role of vegetables in cash crops and healthy development will be improved.
By utilizing spaces around our residence, we can grow vitamin A rich sweetpotatoes, potatoes, green vegetables and fruits. This will allow our families to consume fresh produce as needed, thereby reducing the need to purchase vegetables from the market, which will help save costs. As a result, the nutritional needs of the family can be met and by selling vegetables income may be generated which then can be used to purchase other essential nutritious foods.
In addition to essential nutrients information on healthy sanitation, safe drinking water, and water related information through the implementation of agricultural practices have been included. International Potato Center (CIP) is working tirelessly for the nutrition and overall development of mothers, children, and adolescents girls in the impoverished communities through various activities.
Hope the publication will be useful to all concerned.

SESSION 1: POTATO PRODUCTION THROUGH ZERO-TILLAGE WITH STARW MULCH FOR HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND INCOME
Topic Potato Production Through Zero-Tillage with Straw Mulch for Household Consumption and Income • To bringing coastal fallow land under crop cultivation. • To know the technique of zero-tillage potato production. Objectives • To encourage family members especially women and children to engage in zero-tillage potato cultivation. • To meet the vegetable requirements of the family and generate income by selling the surplus. • To improve soil fertility by use of mulch (mulch by rice straw or rice stubble left after harvesting) Method Discussion and practice Duration One hour Materials Module and flipchart
The potato is one of the most important food crops in the world, serving as a staple food in about 40 countries. In Bangladesh, it is a significant part of the diet. Coastal areas in Bangladesh comprise about 30 percent of the total land area, yet potato cultivation is uncommon there. The primary challenges for potato farming in these regions include poor soil tilth, high salinity levels (ranging from 2-25 dS/m), and scarce ir- rigation water. Consequently, a large portion of land remains fallow during the Rabi season after harvesting the Aman rice. To address these issues, the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) has developed a zero-tillage potato cultivation technique that utilizes rice straw mulch. This innovative method can sig- nificantly benefit farmers in coastal areas.
Advantages of zero-tillage potato production:
Fallow land can be converted to productive farmland.
Due to tillage, potato can be planted 15-20 days
earlier.
• Reduced production costs due to the elimination of tillage, less labor and irrigation requirement.
Lower labor and irrigation requirements.
• Increased soil fertility through the use of rice straw mulch.
Most importantly, increases yields.

ZERO-TILLAGE POTATO CULTIVATION TECHNIQUES:
Time of Planting: If you plant potatoes after harvesting Aman rice, ideally between the first and third weeks of December, you can expect optimal yields. You need to plant potatoes in such conditions, if you walk barefoot in the mud, your feet get stuck, but your feet don’t get muddy.
Varieties: Salt-tolerant varieties like BARI Alu-72 and BARI Alu-78, as well as heat-tolerant varieties like BARI Alu-73 and BARI Alu-79, are suitable for zero-tillage cultivation.
Seed Size: It is best to plant whole seed potatoes weighing 40-50 grams. If the seed potatoes are large, they can be cut into pieces, each with at least two eyes.
Seed Treatment: If the seed potatoes were not treated before storage, soak them in a 3% solution of boric acid, Provax-200 WP, Amister Top, Bavistin-50 WP, or Vitavax-200 (mix 3 grams of powder in 1 liter of water) for 10-15 minutes before sprouting. After soaking, dry the seed potatoes in the shade. If the potatoes are cut, dry the cut pieces in the shade for 3-4 hours before planting and coat, them with ash.
Planting Method: Generally, seed potatoes are planted in rows, maintaining a row-to-row distance of 16 inches (40 cm) and a seed-to-seed distance of 8 inches (20 cm). When planting, press the seed potato into the soil to a depth of one-third of its diameter. Cover each seed potato with compost or organic manure at a rate of 40 kg per decimal. Then, cover the planted seed potatoes with a 6-8 inch (15-20 cm) layer of straw, applying fertilizer on both sides of the row.
Fertilizer Dosage and Method of Application: Usually, apply 1.2 kg of urea, 800 grams of TSP (Triple Super Phosphate), 1 kg of MoP (Muriate of Potash), 400 grams of gypsum, 40 grams of zinc sulfate, and 30 grams of boron per decimal of land. However, the dosages of fertilizers and manures may vary based on the fertility of the soil. At planting, apply half of the urea and MoP, along with other fertilizers. Apply the remaining half of urea and MoP at 30-35 days after planting, followed by light irrigation after top-dressing.
Diseases and Control Measures: Major potato diseases include late blight, bacterial wilt, potato scab, stem rot, and viral diseases, with late blight being particularly dangerous. Outbreaks can occur during foggy weather or prolonged cloudy skies with drizzle. During such conditions, spray Dithane M 45, Acrobat MZ, or Secure at a rate of 2 grams per liter over the entire potato plants.
Harvesting and Yield: Harvest zero-tillage potatoes 75-85 days after planting. The average yield of potato grown in this technique is 60-80 kg per decimal of land.
Zero tillage potato cultivation is a profitable technique. It is possible to earn average Taka 40,000 to 45,000 per bigha of land by cultivating potato in this technique. Adopting zero-tillage potato cultivation can in- crease cropping intensity and productivity in coastal saline areas.

Why will you grow orange-fleshed sweetpotato?
Addresses Vitamin A and nutrient deficiencies.
Maximizes calorie yield per unit of land.
Utilizes tips and leaves as a vegetable.
Less susceptible to plant diseases and insects.
Resilient to drought stress.
Suitable for cultivation in homesteads; requires minimal care, making it manageable for women.
CULTIVATION TECHNIQUE OF ORANGE-FLESHED SWEETPOTATO:
A) Sweetpotato Vine Production Techniques:
Sweetpotatoes are typically propagated using vines. Vines are grown in seedbeds and transplanted to the main field in the subsequent season. To produce 220 vines, plant 20–25 cuttings in an area of 40–50 square feet. To cultivate sweetpotato in one decimal of the homestead area 220 vines is required. In this case the following steps are to be followed:
Step 1 - Site Selection and Land Preparation:
Choose a raised area within or near the homestead that gets enough sunlight and has well-draining loamy soil. Prepare the sweetpotato seedbed by thorough plowing or digging with a spade.
Step 2 - Fertilizer Application:
Mix 4-5 kg of cow dung, 20-25 g of urea, 18-20 g of TSP (Triple Super Phosphate), and 18-20 g of MOP (Mu- riate of Potash) thoroughly into the soil of the seedbed 2-3 days before planting the vines.
Step 3 - Preparation of Cuttings:
Harvest sweetpotatoes planted the previous year when they mature around (mid Chaitra) early April month, which is ideal for making vine cuttings. Collect cuttings from disease-free, healthy, vigorous, and mature vines. Each vine cutting should be 20-25 cm long and have 4-5 nodes per segment.
Step 4 - Planting:
Plant the cuttings in prepared soil immediately after harvesting potatoes in the month of Chaitra (April/ May). Maintain a row-to-row distance of 1.5-2 feet and a cutting-to-cutting distance of 1 foot. Ensure that 2-3 nodes are buried in the soil. Light irrigation should follow immediately after planting the cuttings.
Step 5 - Collection of Vines:
To propagate sweetpotatoes, gather healthy, fresh, vigorous, and pest-free vines during October - November (Kartik-Agrahayan).

B) Sweetpotato production through modern technique:
Soil and Climate:
Orange-fleshed sweetpotatoes grown in sunny, raised and well-drained land. Sandy loam soils are optimal, but with proper management, they can be cultivated in various soil types. The plant performs best at temperatures ranging from 22 to 25°C, which promotes highest carbohydrate accumulation. Soil temperatures below 10°C hinder plant growth.
Land Preparation:
Prepare the land thoroughly with 5-6 plowings, cross plowings, and harrowing.
Planting Time:
The ideal time for planting orange-fleshed sweetpotato vines or cuttings is from mid-October to November (Kartika to Mid Agrahayan).
Vine Planting Method and Number of Vines:
Plant the first and second sections from the top of the sweetpotato vine, with preference for the first sec- tion as it yields higher. Each vine should be 10 to 12 inches long and have two to three nodes buried below ground when planted in rows. Maintain a spacing of 30 cm between plants and 60 cm between rows. Ap- proximately 220-240 vines are needed per decimal of land.

12
Intercultural Operations:
Depending on soil moisture, two to three irrigations may be neces- sary. The first irrigation should be applied 30 to 35 days after planting, with a second irrigation at 60 to 65 days after planting. Ensure proper drainage systems are in place to eliminate excess heavy rainwater. Vine lifting should be done at least twice a month, starting 50–60 days after planting, to promote healthy growth. Earthing up is essential for proper sweetpotato root development. Keep the land weed-free from plant- ing until the seedlings are 35–40 days old to ensure optimal growth.
Pest Control Management:
In our country, sweetpotato diseases are rare in the field. However, the following insects occasionally attack sweetpotatoes:
Sweetpotato Weevil: This pest affects both field and stored tubers, rendering sweetpotatoes unsuitable for consumption.
Control Measures for Sweetpotato Weevil: Before planting, soak the vines in a pesticide solution made by mixing one milliliter of Benicron or Dimicron with one liter of water for twenty minutes to prevent sweetpotato weevil infestation. This treatment effectively eliminates adult insects, larvae, and eggs. If infestation occurs after planting, apply 8 grams of Diazine-14G or Carbofuran-5G along the rows and lightly irrigate. Additionally, pheromone traps can be used to capture male weevils effectively.
Harvesting and Yield: Orange-fleshed sweetpotatoes are ready for harvesting approximately 120–135 days after transplanting, typically in March or April. Harvesting is usually done manually using a spade to avoid damaging the tubers, ensuring the soil is in Joe condition (tilth condition). Care should be taken during harvesting to prevent cuts or injuries to the sweetpotatoes. Depending on soil type and management practices, the yield per decimal of land can range from 120 to 140 kg.

SESSION 3: HOMESTEAD VEGETABLE CULTIVATION FOR HOUSEHOLD NUTRITION
Topic Homestead Vegetable Cultivation for Household Nutrition • Understand the benefits of growing vegetables in home garden. • Learn how to cultivate vegetables year-round in a homestead garden or on a farm, and how consuming the produce can reduce family malnutrition. Objectives • Encourage family members, especially women and children, to actively participate in vegetable produce. • You might be able to earn extra income by selling the surplus vegetables produced in your home garden. Method Discussion and practice Duration One hour Materials Module and flipchart
To meet a family’s vegetable needs, extensive agricultural land is not required. If the land around the home is systematically cultivated for vegetables, it can satisfy the family’s needs throughout the year. With ap- proximately 1.5 crore homesteads in villages across the nation, widespread vegetable cultivation in these areas could significantly reduce malnutrition. Those with available space can create vegetable gardens, while those without backyards can utilize any fallow land for growing seasonal vegetables.
Encouraging young boys and girls to take an interest in gardening and tree planting is crucial. By fostering a habit of growing and consuming vegetables from an early age, they will develop a mindset that values homegrown produce. With modern knowledge and technology, everyone can cultivate vegetables in their own home gardens to meet their nutritional needs. Adopting this practice will offer numerous benefits to families and communities.
What is homestead garden?
A homestead garden is an area where various kinds of fruits and vegetables are grown all year round in the open spaces surrounding the homestead to provide for the family's nutritional needs.
Goals and Significance of a Home Garden:
Transforming fallow land into productive cultivation areas.
Addressing vitamin A deficiencies in infants and expectant mothers.
Reducing infant mortality and preventing blindness.
Providing vegetables free from toxic substances.
Keeping the yard organized and aesthetically pleasing with vegetable gardening.
Utilizing local resources and technology effectively.

Ensuring fair and equitable distribution of family labor.
Growing a variety of vegetables on the same plot of land.
Meeting the family’s vegetable needs while generating additional income from surplus produce.
Choosing a Location for a Homestead Garden:
1. Select a site with sandy soil that receives full sun throughout the day.
2. Ensure the garden area is elevated to prevent waterlogging from rain.
3. Choose a location that does not interfere with other household activities.
Selection of Vegetables for Homestead Gardens:
When selecting vegetables for homestead gardens, prioritize those that are nutritious, flavorful, tasty, and meet the family’s needs, while also considering the potential for selling any surplus. The following vegeta- bles are suitable for cultivation using bed and pit methods in homestead areas.
(a) Vegetables for Beds:
Sweetpotato (orange-fleshed); Potato; Radish; Tomato; Red amaranth/Stem amaranth; Brinjal; Cabbage;
Cauliflower
(b) Vegetables for Mada/Pit:

SESSION 4: IMPORTANCE OF BALANCED DIET AND
NUTRITION
Topic Importance of Balanced Diet and Nutrition • To be aware about nutrition and diet. Objectives • Benefit of balanced diet and good nutrition. Method Discussion Duration One hour Materials Module and flipchart
The primary goal of a diet is to maintain a strong, healthy, and functional body. While any food can satisfy hunger, it does not necessarily support health or meet the body’s nutritional needs. Malnutrition can affect both the undernourished and the affluent. Therefore, understanding proper nutrition and diet is essential for everyone.
Few people suffer from malnutrition solely due to insufficient food intake. Instead, most people become malnourished by consuming food without considering its nutritional content. Often, malnutrition goes unnoticed because its effects can be subtle and not immediately obvious. Long-term deficiencies in vitamins and minerals can suppress hunger signals, making it difficult for individuals to recognize their nutritional needs. Malnutrition not only affects productivity but also leads to health problems, which in turn impacts overall economic well-being.
Eating only three meals a day is not enough to maintain a strong, active, and healthy body. It’s essential to be mindful of both the nutritional content and quality of your food. Ensuring that your diet includes nutrient- rich foods is crucial for sustaining overall health and functionality.
Malnutrition persists in our nation largely due to insufficient knowledge about nutrition. To combat this issue, it is essential to increase nutritional awareness, ensure balanced food consumption, employ appropriate cooking techniques, and manage family meal distribution effectively. By carefully selecting nutrient-rich foods and preparing them properly, we can break the cycle of malnutrition and improve overall health.

18
Vegetables supply essential vitamin A and mineral salts, which are crucial for meeting the body's nutri- tional needs and maintaining overall health. The body requires various nutrients on a regular basis to stay healthy, but not all of these nutrients are present in every meal. To meet nutritional requirements, it is im- portant to include the seven key food elements in the daily diet:
1) Carbohydrates 5) Mineral salts 2) Proteins 6) Dietary fiber and 3) Fats/Oil 7) Water
1) Carbohydrates
2) Proteins
3) Fats/Oil
4) Vitamins
Everyone should consistently consume the recommended amounts of foods rich in the seven essential nutrient categories: Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats, Vitamins, Mineral Salts, Dietary Fiber, and Water.
The sources and functions of seven types of food elements are discussed below:

FORWARD
“Training of Trainers Guide to Improving Child Health and Nutrition through Diets, Feeding and Hygiene Practices” has been prepared under various projects implemented by International Potato Center (CIP), Bangladesh. In the future, we want to use Community Nutrition Scholars (CNS) to train mothers using this training guide. In our country, mothers, children, and adolescents are mostly victims of malnutrition; with this training, we aim to provide information about nutritious and healthy food specifically for them.
The aim of this training is to cultivate potatoes without traditional farming, to enhance agricultural development by cultivating orange-fleshed sweetpotato and vegetables in home gardens, easy access to vegetables and variety of nutrients in vegetables increases tendency to eat promoting healthy eating habits and helps to learn techniques of cooking process while maintaining quality of nutrients. Through this guide awareness on nutritional value of potatoes, orange-fleshed sweetpotatoes and sweetpotato vines will be increased, as well as awareness on the role of vegetables in cash crops and healthy development will be improved.
By utilizing spaces around our residence, we can grow vitamin A rich sweetpotatoes, potatoes, green vegetables and fruits. This will allow our families to consume fresh produce as needed, thereby reducing the need to purchase vegetables from the market, which will help save costs. As a result, the nutritional needs of the family can be met and by selling vegetables income may be generated which then can be used to purchase other essential nutritious foods.
In addition to essential nutrients information on healthy sanitation, safe drinking water, and water related information through the implementation of agricultural practices have been included. International Potato Center (CIP) is working tirelessly for the nutrition and overall development of mothers, children, and adolescents girls in the impoverished communities through various activities.
Hope the publication will be useful to all concerned.

SESSION 1: POTATO PRODUCTION THROUGH ZERO-TILLAGE WITH STARW MULCH FOR HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND INCOME
Topic Potato Production Through Zero-Tillage with Straw Mulch for Household Consumption and Income • To bringing coastal fallow land under crop cultivation. • To know the technique of zero-tillage potato production. Objectives • To encourage family members especially women and children to engage in zero-tillage potato cultivation. • To meet the vegetable requirements of the family and generate income by selling the surplus. • To improve soil fertility by use of mulch (mulch by rice straw or rice stubble left after harvesting) Method Discussion and practice Duration One hour Materials Module and flipchart
The potato is one of the most important food crops in the world, serving as a staple food in about 40 countries. In Bangladesh, it is a significant part of the diet. Coastal areas in Bangladesh comprise about 30 percent of the total land area, yet potato cultivation is uncommon there. The primary challenges for potato farming in these regions include poor soil tilth, high salinity levels (ranging from 2-25 dS/m), and scarce ir- rigation water. Consequently, a large portion of land remains fallow during the Rabi season after harvesting the Aman rice. To address these issues, the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) has developed a zero-tillage potato cultivation technique that utilizes rice straw mulch. This innovative method can sig- nificantly benefit farmers in coastal areas.
Advantages of zero-tillage potato production:
Fallow land can be converted to productive farmland.
Due to tillage, potato can be planted 15-20 days
earlier.
• Reduced production costs due to the elimination of tillage, less labor and irrigation requirement.
Lower labor and irrigation requirements.
• Increased soil fertility through the use of rice straw mulch.
Most importantly, increases yields.

ZERO-TILLAGE POTATO CULTIVATION TECHNIQUES:
Time of Planting: If you plant potatoes after harvesting Aman rice, ideally between the first and third weeks of December, you can expect optimal yields. You need to plant potatoes in such conditions, if you walk barefoot in the mud, your feet get stuck, but your feet don’t get muddy.
Varieties: Salt-tolerant varieties like BARI Alu-72 and BARI Alu-78, as well as heat-tolerant varieties like BARI Alu-73 and BARI Alu-79, are suitable for zero-tillage cultivation.
Seed Size: It is best to plant whole seed potatoes weighing 40-50 grams. If the seed potatoes are large, they can be cut into pieces, each with at least two eyes.
Seed Treatment: If the seed potatoes were not treated before storage, soak them in a 3% solution of boric acid, Provax-200 WP, Amister Top, Bavistin-50 WP, or Vitavax-200 (mix 3 grams of powder in 1 liter of water) for 10-15 minutes before sprouting. After soaking, dry the seed potatoes in the shade. If the potatoes are cut, dry the cut pieces in the shade for 3-4 hours before planting and coat, them with ash.
Planting Method: Generally, seed potatoes are planted in rows, maintaining a row-to-row distance of 16 inches (40 cm) and a seed-to-seed distance of 8 inches (20 cm). When planting, press the seed potato into the soil to a depth of one-third of its diameter. Cover each seed potato with compost or organic manure at a rate of 40 kg per decimal. Then, cover the planted seed potatoes with a 6-8 inch (15-20 cm) layer of straw, applying fertilizer on both sides of the row.
Fertilizer Dosage and Method of Application: Usually, apply 1.2 kg of urea, 800 grams of TSP (Triple Super Phosphate), 1 kg of MoP (Muriate of Potash), 400 grams of gypsum, 40 grams of zinc sulfate, and 30 grams of boron per decimal of land. However, the dosages of fertilizers and manures may vary based on the fertility of the soil. At planting, apply half of the urea and MoP, along with other fertilizers. Apply the remaining half of urea and MoP at 30-35 days after planting, followed by light irrigation after top-dressing.
Diseases and Control Measures: Major potato diseases include late blight, bacterial wilt, potato scab, stem rot, and viral diseases, with late blight being particularly dangerous. Outbreaks can occur during foggy weather or prolonged cloudy skies with drizzle. During such conditions, spray Dithane M 45, Acrobat MZ, or Secure at a rate of 2 grams per liter over the entire potato plants.
Harvesting and Yield: Harvest zero-tillage potatoes 75-85 days after planting. The average yield of potato grown in this technique is 60-80 kg per decimal of land.
Zero tillage potato cultivation is a profitable technique. It is possible to earn average Taka 40,000 to 45,000 per bigha of land by cultivating potato in this technique. Adopting zero-tillage potato cultivation can in- crease cropping intensity and productivity in coastal saline areas.

Why will you grow orange-fleshed sweetpotato?
Addresses Vitamin A and nutrient deficiencies.
Maximizes calorie yield per unit of land.
Utilizes tips and leaves as a vegetable.
Less susceptible to plant diseases and insects.
Resilient to drought stress.
Suitable for cultivation in homesteads; requires minimal care, making it manageable for women.
CULTIVATION TECHNIQUE OF ORANGE-FLESHED SWEETPOTATO:
A) Sweetpotato Vine Production Techniques:
Sweetpotatoes are typically propagated using vines. Vines are grown in seedbeds and transplanted to the main field in the subsequent season. To produce 220 vines, plant 20–25 cuttings in an area of 40–50 square feet. To cultivate sweetpotato in one decimal of the homestead area 220 vines is required. In this case the following steps are to be followed:
Step 1 - Site Selection and Land Preparation:
Choose a raised area within or near the homestead that gets enough sunlight and has well-draining loamy soil. Prepare the sweetpotato seedbed by thorough plowing or digging with a spade.
Step 2 - Fertilizer Application:
Mix 4-5 kg of cow dung, 20-25 g of urea, 18-20 g of TSP (Triple Super Phosphate), and 18-20 g of MOP (Mu- riate of Potash) thoroughly into the soil of the seedbed 2-3 days before planting the vines.
Step 3 - Preparation of Cuttings:
Harvest sweetpotatoes planted the previous year when they mature around (mid Chaitra) early April month, which is ideal for making vine cuttings. Collect cuttings from disease-free, healthy, vigorous, and mature vines. Each vine cutting should be 20-25 cm long and have 4-5 nodes per segment.
Step 4 - Planting:
Plant the cuttings in prepared soil immediately after harvesting potatoes in the month of Chaitra (April/ May). Maintain a row-to-row distance of 1.5-2 feet and a cutting-to-cutting distance of 1 foot. Ensure that 2-3 nodes are buried in the soil. Light irrigation should follow immediately after planting the cuttings.
Step 5 - Collection of Vines:
To propagate sweetpotatoes, gather healthy, fresh, vigorous, and pest-free vines during October - November (Kartik-Agrahayan).


Figure 3. Preparation of cutting
Figure 4. Vine collection
11
B) Sweetpotato production through modern technique:
Soil and Climate:
Orange-fleshed sweetpotatoes grown in sunny, raised and well-drained land. Sandy loam soils are optimal, but with proper management, they can be cultivated in various soil types. The plant performs best at temperatures ranging from 22 to 25°C, which promotes highest carbohydrate accumulation. Soil temperatures below 10°C hinder plant growth.
Land Preparation:
Prepare the land thoroughly with 5-6 plowings, cross plowings, and harrowing.
Planting Time:
The ideal time for planting orange-fleshed sweetpotato vines or cuttings is from mid-October to November (Kartika to Mid Agrahayan).
Vine Planting Method and Number of Vines:
Plant the first and second sections from the top of the sweetpotato vine, with preference for the first sec- tion as it yields higher. Each vine should be 10 to 12 inches long and have two to three nodes buried below ground when planted in rows. Maintain a spacing of 30 cm between plants and 60 cm between rows. Ap- proximately 220-240 vines are needed per decimal of land.

Doses of Fertilizer and Application Method (per decimal land):
Name of fertilizers and manure Basal dose (during land preparation) First top dressing (14-15 days after seedlings transplanting) Second top dressing (30-35 days after seedlings transplanting) Cow dung (kg) 40 - 50 - - Urea (gm) 550 - 650 280 - 325 280 - 325 TSP (gm) 300 - 500 - - MoP (g) 300 - 375 - 300 - 375
12
Intercultural Operations:
Depending on soil moisture, two to three irrigations may be neces- sary. The first irrigation should be applied 30 to 35 days after planting, with a second irrigation at 60 to 65 days after planting. Ensure proper drainage systems are in place to eliminate excess heavy rainwater. Vine lifting should be done at least twice a month, starting 50–60 days after planting, to promote healthy growth. Earthing up is essential for proper sweetpotato root development. Keep the land weed-free from plant- ing until the seedlings are 35–40 days old to ensure optimal growth.
Pest Control Management:
In our country, sweetpotato diseases are rare in the field. However, the following insects occasionally attack sweetpotatoes:
Sweetpotato Weevil: This pest affects both field and stored tubers, rendering sweetpotatoes unsuitable for consumption.
Control Measures for Sweetpotato Weevil: Before planting, soak the vines in a pesticide solution made by mixing one milliliter of Benicron or Dimicron with one liter of water for twenty minutes to prevent sweetpotato weevil infestation. This treatment effectively eliminates adult insects, larvae, and eggs. If infestation occurs after planting, apply 8 grams of Diazine-14G or Carbofuran-5G along the rows and lightly irrigate. Additionally, pheromone traps can be used to capture male weevils effectively.
Harvesting and Yield: Orange-fleshed sweetpotatoes are ready for harvesting approximately 120–135 days after transplanting, typically in March or April. Harvesting is usually done manually using a spade to avoid damaging the tubers, ensuring the soil is in Joe condition (tilth condition). Care should be taken during harvesting to prevent cuts or injuries to the sweetpotatoes. Depending on soil type and management practices, the yield per decimal of land can range from 120 to 140 kg.

SESSION 3: HOMESTEAD VEGETABLE CULTIVATION FOR HOUSEHOLD NUTRITION
Topic Homestead Vegetable Cultivation for Household Nutrition • Understand the benefits of growing vegetables in home garden. • Learn how to cultivate vegetables year-round in a homestead garden or on a farm, and how consuming the produce can reduce family malnutrition. Objectives • Encourage family members, especially women and children, to actively participate in vegetable produce. • You might be able to earn extra income by selling the surplus vegetables produced in your home garden. Method Discussion and practice Duration One hour Materials Module and flipchart
To meet a family’s vegetable needs, extensive agricultural land is not required. If the land around the home is systematically cultivated for vegetables, it can satisfy the family’s needs throughout the year. With ap- proximately 1.5 crore homesteads in villages across the nation, widespread vegetable cultivation in these areas could significantly reduce malnutrition. Those with available space can create vegetable gardens, while those without backyards can utilize any fallow land for growing seasonal vegetables.
Encouraging young boys and girls to take an interest in gardening and tree planting is crucial. By fostering a habit of growing and consuming vegetables from an early age, they will develop a mindset that values homegrown produce. With modern knowledge and technology, everyone can cultivate vegetables in their own home gardens to meet their nutritional needs. Adopting this practice will offer numerous benefits to families and communities.
What is homestead garden?
A homestead garden is an area where various kinds of fruits and vegetables are grown all year round in the open spaces surrounding the homestead to provide for the family's nutritional needs.
Goals and Significance of a Home Garden:
Transforming fallow land into productive cultivation areas.
Addressing vitamin A deficiencies in infants and expectant mothers.
Reducing infant mortality and preventing blindness.
Providing vegetables free from toxic substances.
Keeping the yard organized and aesthetically pleasing with vegetable gardening.
Utilizing local resources and technology effectively.

Ensuring fair and equitable distribution of family labor.
Growing a variety of vegetables on the same plot of land.
Meeting the family’s vegetable needs while generating additional income from surplus produce.
Choosing a Location for a Homestead Garden:
1. Select a site with sandy soil that receives full sun throughout the day.
2. Ensure the garden area is elevated to prevent waterlogging from rain.
3. Choose a location that does not interfere with other household activities.
Selection of Vegetables for Homestead Gardens:
When selecting vegetables for homestead gardens, prioritize those that are nutritious, flavorful, tasty, and meet the family’s needs, while also considering the potential for selling any surplus. The following vegeta- bles are suitable for cultivation using bed and pit methods in homestead areas.
(a) Vegetables for Beds:
Sweetpotato (orange-fleshed); Potato; Radish; Tomato; Red amaranth/Stem amaranth; Brinjal; Cabbage;
Cauliflower
(b) Vegetables for Mada/Pit:
Sweet pumpkin; Bottle gourd; Bitter gourd; Snake gourd; Pointed gourd; Sponge gourd; Ridge gourd.

A 25-30 cm wide area should be left around the garden for fencing and planting vines. Construct 25 cm wide drains on all four sides of the garden. Create beds that are 80 cm wide and 5 meters long, ensuring a 25 cm wide space between the beds for drainage and easy of intercultural operations. This design allows excess water to drain effectively and facilitates access for vegetable cultivation and maintenance. Note that the dimensions of the garden area, drains, and beds may vary depending on the available land size.
Arrangement of Vegetables in Beds:
First Bed: Sweetpotato – Red amaranth – Red amaranth – Sweetpotato vines Second Bed: Potato – Jute spinach (young jute leaves) – Coriander + Brinjal Third Bed: Tomato – Spinach/Red amaranth – Stem amaranth Fourth Bed: Onion + Carrot – Red amaranth – Okra Fifth Bed: Radish/Cauliflower – Spinach – Yardlong bean/Indian spinach

SESSION 4: IMPORTANCE OF BALANCED DIET AND
NUTRITION
Topic Importance of Balanced Diet and Nutrition • To be aware about nutrition and diet. Objectives • Benefit of balanced diet and good nutrition. Method Discussion Duration One hour Materials Module and flipchart
The primary goal of a diet is to maintain a strong, healthy, and functional body. While any food can satisfy hunger, it does not necessarily support health or meet the body’s nutritional needs. Malnutrition can affect both the undernourished and the affluent. Therefore, understanding proper nutrition and diet is essential for everyone.
Few people suffer from malnutrition solely due to insufficient food intake. Instead, most people become malnourished by consuming food without considering its nutritional content. Often, malnutrition goes unnoticed because its effects can be subtle and not immediately obvious. Long-term deficiencies in vitamins and minerals can suppress hunger signals, making it difficult for individuals to recognize their nutritional needs. Malnutrition not only affects productivity but also leads to health problems, which in turn impacts overall economic well-being.
Eating only three meals a day is not enough to maintain a strong, active, and healthy body. It’s essential to be mindful of both the nutritional content and quality of your food. Ensuring that your diet includes nutrient- rich foods is crucial for sustaining overall health and functionality.
Malnutrition persists in our nation largely due to insufficient knowledge about nutrition. To combat this issue, it is essential to increase nutritional awareness, ensure balanced food consumption, employ appropriate cooking techniques, and manage family meal distribution effectively. By carefully selecting nutrient-rich foods and preparing them properly, we can break the cycle of malnutrition and improve overall health.

Vegetables supply essential vitamin A and mineral salts, which are crucial for meeting the body's nutri- tional needs and maintaining overall health. The body requires various nutrients on a regular basis to stay healthy, but not all of these nutrients are present in every meal. To meet nutritional requirements, it is im- portant to include the seven key food elements in the daily diet:
1) Carbohydrates 5) Mineral salts 2) Proteins 6) Dietary fiber and 3) Fats/Oil 7) Water
1) Carbohydrates
2) Proteins
3) Fats/Oil
4) Vitamins
Everyone should consistently consume the recommended amounts of foods rich in the seven essential nutrient categories: Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats, Vitamins, Mineral Salts, Dietary Fiber, and Water.
The sources and functions of seven types of food elements are discussed below:

1. Introduction
The CGIAR Initiative on Climate Resilience (ClimBeR) tackles the challenge of helping food and agricultural systems in low- and middle-income countries better prepare for climate change. Climate impacts, such as extreme weather and temperature shifts, are especially challenging for countries in the Global South. These impacts often lead to loss of resources, reduced human capacity, and increased uncertainty in agriculture, which makes it difficult for small-scale farmers to improve their livelihoods. This, in turn, can worsen poverty and social tensions.
Countries partnering with this initiative are facing specific climate risks: Kenya, Senegal, and Zambia frequently deal with droughts, floods, and high temperatures; Morocco and Guatemala are vulnerable to drought and heat; while the Philippines faces frequent floods and rising temperatures.
In recent years, there’s been a shift from simply understanding climate impacts to actively developing solutions and funding to meet ambitious climate and food security goals. Standalone efforts to boost crop yields or market access are no longer enough. To truly improve resilience, productivity, and fairness, a broad transformation of these systems is needed.
Program Objective
ClimBeR aims to significantly improve the capacity of food, land, and water systems to adapt to climate change across six low- and middle-income countries. The goal is to enhance the resilience of smallholder farming systems, enabling them to better withstand extreme climate events like droughts, floods, and high temperatures.
Work Package 2 – Climate Security (WP2): building resilient agricultural systems by understanding the connections between climate, peace, and security
Climate Security is a key focus area for ClimBeR. International, regional, and national organizations are increasingly recognizing the crucial connection between climate, peace, and security. However, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive research that unpacks the intricate dynamics of this relationship. Many donors and governments recognize that climate change acts as a ""threat multiplier,"" meaning it can exacerbate existing risks and insecurities in agricultural communities, increasing the chances of conflict and instability.
To address the lack of strong, localized, and policy-focused evidence about these risks, researchers led by the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT, through CGIAR FOCUS Climate Security, have developed analysis, tools and guidelines to characterize the climate security nexus and provide recommendations for policy and programming that aims to tackle this issue. A central element of the activities was the establishment of strategic partnerships with local and regional government bodies, civil society and organizations to raise awareness on climate security and advance this agenda at regional, national and local levels.
Two years after the launch of the initiative, this evaluation sought to understand the influence of ClimBeR in motivating actors to address climate security in the five countries where WP2 activities were

developed: Guatemala, Kenya, Philippines, Senegal and Zambia. It employed an innovative approach based on the Digital Methods epistemology and Machine Learning techniques to assess digital content that could provide insights about the reach of the initiative at various levels. This report describes the methodology and presents the main findings from the research carried out between June-November 2024.
The Digital Methods approach
The pervasiveness of the internet in people’s lives is undeniable. According to the latest data1, more than 66 percent of the world’s population now use the internet, with the latest data putting the global user total at 5.35 billion. Statistics also show that active social media user identities have passed the 5 billion mark, with the latest user figure equivalent to 62.3 percent of the world’s population2.
The internet has been increasingly integrated into existing offline practices and social relationships, rather than existing as a separate dimension. This hybridization of online and offline realities has effectively established the internet as a space for research on social phenomena. Among various epistemological approaches, 'Digital Methods' (Rogers, 2013, 2015) is defined as the provision of techniques to explain social phenomena through online dynamics, with the web as the data set.
Online spaces offer ample opportunities for analyzing and visualizing trends in contemporary issues due to several aspects: issue traces are accessible online; the analytics leverage on the dynamic features and affordances of online media; and digital platforms provide data (for instance, metadata, links, hashtags, mentions, etc.) that can be structured for systematic analysis (Carneiro, Resce, & Sapkota, 2022).
Employing Digital Methods to assess the influence of WP2 – Climate Security
Relying on innovative research methods that leverage digital platforms as proxies for wider public discourse and engagement, this study explored the influence of ClimBeR’s WP2 through data analytics, with the application of machine learning techniques primarily focused on text mining and network analysis of content disseminated on the web (social media and websites).
Based on the analytical framework employed to map the policy influence of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) (Carneiro, Resce, Läderach, et al., 2022) and CIMMYT’s climate change research portfolio (Carneiro, Resce, & Sapkota, 2022) the research assesses the process of knowledge dissemination of WP2 activities and changes in the discourse of initiative partners by considering online networks and narratives as evidence of “offline” program influence.
The main questions we explore are:
1. Has ClimBeR helped raise awareness of the linkages between climate, peace, and security?
2. Has the initiative motivated its partners to adopt a climate security lens in their public communications?

2. Methodology
While ClimBeR outcomes monitoring includes reporting on the number of policies, legal instruments, and investments that have been informed by the Initiative’s research, these indicators may not be capturing the full extent of the program’s influence, as it does not consider the processes that enable policy or investment decisions. In such cases, ‘soft power’ plays an important role in raising awareness and shaping perceptions of climate security implications to adaptation. The analysis provides a current perspective on the institutional and policy discourses that have not yet been translated into formal documents.
Based on this notion, the text mining approach proposed by Carneiro et al (2022) was adapted to account for the specificities of ClimBeR’s WP2. Two main adjustments were made. First, the taxonomy development combined a data-driven technique with expert consultation to ensure the appropriate concepts were captured in the text analysis. Secondly, the text mining analysis included data from social media (the platform X, formerly Twitter) and websites of initiative partners.
Mapping partners’ online presence
As a starting point, the regional hubs of CGIAR FOCUS Climate Security identified the partnerships and institutional engagements developed over the course of the initiative’s WP2 implementation. Figure 1 presents the distribution of partners identified, 114 in total, with Zambia and Philippines presenting the lowest numbers due to activities in those countries beginning at a later stage in the initiative.
A digital platforms mapping exercise was carried out to identify the main platforms used by these partners, which determined that a significant majority maintained institutional websites and active profiles on X (formerly Twitter). In total, 107 partners had websites (94%) and 104 has X profiles (91%).

Data Collection
Social media: X (formerly Twitter)
Data was collected from X profiles affiliated with project partners to gain insights into social media discourse across diverse geographic regions. The platform was chosen due to its importance as a digital forum for information exchanges and dialogue, and its role in hosting discussions on climate and environmental issues (Pearce et al., 2019). The dataset includes 134 Twitter/X accounts connected to partners in the five countries considered in the analysis. This figure is higher than the number of partners as some institutions maintained more than one profile.
Data acquisition was achieved using a custom Python script that accessed platform endpoints. The script was designed as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, utilizing the Luigi package to manage workflows. The script takes as input the list of 134 accounts from a JSON file and, for each account, creates a task that scrapes the entire timeline. Each tweet is parsed for relevant information, and the results are saved in a TSV file. This design allows for the efficient recovery of data collection after any failure or interruption, ensuring that the process can resume seamlessly from the last completed operation.
Partner Websites
As part of the analyses’ multi-faceted data collection strategy, a specialized web-scraping process was employed to gather text data from partner websites. Data was collected from over 100 websites associated with the ClimBeR project. In order to retrieve data from websites in the past, we utilized the internet archive Wayback Machine3. This tool enables users to navigate through time and observe the evolution of websites over the years.
A specialized scraping tool, developed using Shell scripting, was employed to automate the extraction of text data. The tool was configured to perform the following tasks:
• Content Download: The tool downloaded only the PDF files and HTML from the web pages linked from the home page of each website. This approach ensured that all text content from the homepage and first-level links was retrieved.
• Web Page Content Extraction: Text was extracted by first cleaning up the HTML.
• PDF File Content Extraction: The tool also identified and extracted text from PDF files linked directly from the home page.
• Storage: The extracted content was then concatenated and compressed before being stored.
This methodology allowed for efficient and thorough data collection.

Description of datasets
Twitter
The data collection process yielded 134 .tsv files, each corresponding to one of the X profiles analyzed. Together, these files occupy approximately 635 MB of storage and contain a cumulative total of 1.43 million tweets, covering a date range from April 2008 to September 2024. Each file holds structured data on the tweets from a specific account, capturing a comprehensive snapshot of social media activity over time.
For each tweet in the dataset, the following fields are included:
• Tweet ID: Unique identifier of the tweet.
• Permalink: URL linking directly to the tweet.
• Date: Timestamp indicating when the tweet was posted.
• Body: Text of the tweet (comprehensive of hashtags, mentions, links)
• User Information: Details of the user who posted the tweet.
• Reply Count: Number of replies to the tweet.
• Like Count: Number of likes received by the tweet.
• Retweet Count: Number of retweets.
Language: Language of the tweet content.
Partner Websites
The scraping of partner websites produced a dataset consisting of a file per website, each containing the concatenated text contents from all the pages and PDF files linked to the homepage of the website. To capture temporal snapshots, a new file was created for each scraping day, enabling the tracking of content changes over time. The use of the Wayback Machine guarantees the comparability of the contents over time, allowing for the analysis of changes in communication. This approach enhances the analysis of the partners' website content, enabling us to ascertain the timing and nature of any changes and their impact on the communication of the partners' activities.
Data analysis
Once the datasets were collected, the analysis was organized into three distinct work streams presented in Figure 2. The key method used was text mining, aimed at capturing and analyzing the multiple meanings embedded in textual data. By combining both qualitative and quantitative text analysis, it was possible to assess content disseminated across websites and social media of ClimBeR’s WP2 partners to determine whether the initiative raised awareness about the linkages between climate, peace, and security.

Work stream 1: Taxonomy development
Our approach began with the creation of a custom taxonomy designed to identify key WP2 terminology from which to map the text from partner sources. For this, machine learning algorithms were applied to perform unsupervised text mining on the titles of 130 research outputs reported by WP2 in CGIAR’s Performance and Results Management System (PRMS) from initiative inception until July 2024.
The algorithm used was the statistical measure tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency), which adjusts the frequency of a term by considering its rarity. The aim of this metric is to assess the importance of a word within a document relative to a broader corpus of documents (Silge & Robinson, 2017). In our context, the tf-idf metric merges two aspects: term frequency, referring to how often a word appears in a title, and inverse document frequency, indicating how uniquely the word is tied to that specific title compared to the overall corpus (Hidalgo & Haussman, 2009).
To identify the most significant words among the most frequent ones, we applied a threshold where tf- idf values greater than or equal to the mean tf-idf plus 1.96 times the standard deviation were considered. This threshold helped highlight terms that are both common in the title and rare across the broader set of documents, making them particularly significant.
The words selected using this method, both unigrams and bigrams, were then assessed, complemented and validated by climate security experts to ensure the most important concepts disseminated by WP2 were captured in the analysis. This final, customized taxonomy forms the key terminology that guided the text analysis process. The final output is shown in Figure 3.

Considering the languages spoken in the countries of analysis, as well as language detection in the X dataset identifying a significant presence of non-English content, the final step was to translate the taxonomy into French (5.25% of tweets) and Spanish (29.1% of tweets) by using Google Translate.

Work stream 2: Text analysis
Text mining techniques were applied to determine a similarity measure between the knowledge products generated from WP2 with the discourses of partners, on their websites and on X.
The first step in text mining is pre-processing data. The R package tm (Feinerer & Hornik, 2020) was utilized to clean the text by removing punctuation, stop words (e.g., ”the,” ”is,” ”of”), numbers and special characters and by converting the remaining words to lowercase.
Subsequently, an analysis was conducted to identify and quantify the taxonomic words within the text. Initially, this search was performed by considering only the absolute frequency of the taxonomic words. Following this, the metric Taxonomic Prevalence Index (TPI) was introduced, which indicates the prevalence of words from the taxonomy in relation to the total number of words present in the text. This index is expressed as a percentage, calculated by the ratio of the sum of taxonomic words to the total sum of words in the text.
The Taxonomic Prevalence Index was calculated for each X profile and each website separately, and subsequently aggregated to yield a single overall value for the entire dataset of X and for all the websites considered.
On X, to measure the influence of ClimBeR on its partners, we assessed the change in the Taxonomic Prevalence Index in the content of tweets before and after the initiative’s launch. For the websites, the TPI for 2024 was compared to that of 2020.
To provide an empirical measure of the correlation between ClimBeR taxonomy and text over time and to test whether the correlation after program launch is significant, a linear regression was performed.
Work stream 3: Network analysis
Using the dataset collected from X, it was possible to assess CGIAR’s place within its network of WP2 partners by analyzing profiled mentioned in partner tweets. A network analysis was performed to explore the relationship between accounts mentioned in the corpus. Network analysis techniques enable the visualization of relational data organized as matrices, where entities are the nodes – in this case, @mentions – and their relations are the lines connecting pairs of nodes. This means that accounts are connected if they are mentioned by another.
The network analysis considers only tweets in which words from the taxonomy were detected, ensuring that mentions are present in the context of conversations about climate security. A force-directed algorithm was used to construct the network displays. Force-directed graphs show the spatialization of nodes by mapping the proximity and the authority of categories in relation to each other (Jacomy et al., 2014). This means that linked nodes are drawn closer while unrelated nodes are pushed farther apart, thus allowing for a visual interpretation of the dynamics between actors in the network. A modularity algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) was applied to identify “communities”, or clusters – as represented by nodes that are more densely connected together than to the rest of the network, and which were colored accordingly.

3. Key Results
Within the social sciences, content analysis methods enable researchers to identify patterns and changes in political agenda over time and across geographies (Brandt, 2019). Based on the principles of Digital Methods, social media activity can act as a proxy for how ClimBeR WP2 activity influences stakeholders, and how stakeholders in turn amplify the program’s mission to a broader audience. The following section presents the results of our analysis of partners' X profiles and websites.
Social media (X)
The period of analysis for X data was from January 2019 to September 2024. From 134 profiles, a subset of 630 thousand tweets were considered. Figure 4 presents an example of a partner tweet with the presence of terms from the WP2 taxonomy.

The word cloud in Figure 5 highlights the most frequent terms used in tweets and allows us to identify the dominant topics of the conversation. In this representation, the largest words are those used most frequently. The most prominent words are violence, security, and peace, suggesting that a significant portion of discussions focused on the security dimension of climate security. Other frequent terms include humanitarian, migration and gender, highlighting the complex linkages between climate insecurity and other social dimensions.

Figure 5: Word cloud of most frequent taxonomy words in tweets
For each account, the Taxonomy Prevalence Index (TPI) was calculated, revealing that conversations about climate security were present in less than 5% of content disseminated by partners. While this figure may seem low, it is important to note that most institutions engaged with WP2 are not climate security-focused, but rather, operate in diverse fields across the HDP Nexus or at the governmental domain.
However, it is important to note that both the absolute word frequency and the TPI, in isolation, are not sufficient indicators of how WP2 has influenced partners' communication strategies. To assess whether there was an increase in awareness concerning climate, peace, and security, along with an evolution in the narrative surrounding these themes, a comparison was made between the TPI values before and after the launch of ClimBeR. This analysis was possible due to the availability of 118 accounts that published tweets in both periods under investigation.
As illustrated in Figure 6, the results demonstrate a marked increase in the TPI following the launch of ClimBeR, with 81 profiles (70%) showing an upward trend in their respective indices.

Aggregating the results without distinction by individual account, a slight increase is evident. The Taxonomy Prevalence Index (TPI) before 2022 stood at an average of 1.04%, while after the launch of the initiative it rose to 1.06%. Although small, considering the length of the program and a thematic focus that is still emerging and was novel to several local partners, this change indicates an achievement regarding increased attention dedicated by partners to issues around climate, peace and security.
To provide an empirical assessment of TPI over time and to evaluate whether the correlation observed after the project's inception is statistically significant, a linear regression analysis was conducted. Table 1 shows that on average, when moving from AfterClimber = 0 to AfterClimber = 1, the prevalence increases by approximately 0.0008percentage points, and the p value of 3,07e^-08 indicates this change is statistically significant.

Executive Summary
This report presents the main findings from a web analytics evaluation of the reach and influence of the CGIAR Climate Resilience Initiative, ClimBeR, specifically focusing on Work Package 2 (WP2), which addresses climate security by exploring the intersections of climate, peace and security in five countries: Guatemala, Kenya, Philippines, Senegal and Zambia.
Work Package 2 aims to enhance the climate resilience of agricultural systems in vulnerable communities by raising awareness of climate security risks and supporting the integration of these risks into policy and programming. This evaluation assesses the initiative’s influence on partners’ public communication and positioning related to climate security through the employment of digital methods, a research approach that leverages online content and data-driven techniques such as Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis to explore social trends.
Key Findings
Increased Awareness and Engagement with Climate Security
The analysis of social media and website content revealed that ClimBeR’s messaging on climate security has gained traction among partners. The TPI analysis showed a measurable increase in the use of climate security terms following the initiative’s launch, indicating that the program has succeeded in raising awareness and fostering alignment with its climate security goals.
2. Geographic Variations in Impact
The initiative’s influence was observed to vary by region. Countries like Kenya, the Philippines, and Senegal showed particularly high increases in climate security engagement, suggesting a stronger programmatic impact in these areas compared to the other two.
Influence within Partner Networks
CGIAR is positioned as a prominent figure in discussions on climate security among its network of partners. Network analysis of social media mentions highlighted ClimBeR’s close associations with regional governments, international organizations, and civil society, affirming its role as a key facilitator in advancing climate security narratives.
Recommendations
1. Enhance Regional Efforts
• Further understanding and addressing specific regional climate security concerns will strengthen initative outcomes.
• Building regional hub capacity will ensure effective dissemination of messaging and sustained focus on climate, peace and security.
2. Strengthen Monitoring of Digital Engagement
• Continuous monitoring of digital content will help track how effectively its messaging reaches and influences partners.
• Monitoring will also enable the initiative to stay attuned to emerging issues and adjust its strategies in real-time.

3
3. Leverage Network Mapping for Targeted Engagement
• Leveraging network analysis, ClimBeR can prioritize outreach efforts, identifying gaps and targeting regions and partners that require more engagement.
4. Triangulate uncovered narrative with policy coherence and expert insights
• While awareness of climate-peace-security issues has increased, it's crucial to assess if this translates into policy action.
• Triangulating network analysis with policy reviews and local expertise will help align ClimBeR's messaging with existing frameworks and identify opportunities for integration. This ensures ClimBeR's message resonates with policymakers and fosters coherent policy development.

1. Introduction
The CGIAR Initiative on Climate Resilience (ClimBeR) tackles the challenge of helping food and agricultural systems in low- and middle-income countries better prepare for climate change. Climate impacts, such as extreme weather and temperature shifts, are especially challenging for countries in the Global South. These impacts often lead to loss of resources, reduced human capacity, and increased uncertainty in agriculture, which makes it difficult for small-scale farmers to improve their livelihoods. This, in turn, can worsen poverty and social tensions.
Countries partnering with this initiative are facing specific climate risks: Kenya, Senegal, and Zambia frequently deal with droughts, floods, and high temperatures; Morocco and Guatemala are vulnerable to drought and heat; while the Philippines faces frequent floods and rising temperatures.
In recent years, there’s been a shift from simply understanding climate impacts to actively developing solutions and funding to meet ambitious climate and food security goals. Standalone efforts to boost crop yields or market access are no longer enough. To truly improve resilience, productivity, and fairness, a broad transformation of these systems is needed.
Program Objective
ClimBeR aims to significantly improve the capacity of food, land, and water systems to adapt to climate change across six low- and middle-income countries. The goal is to enhance the resilience of smallholder farming systems, enabling them to better withstand extreme climate events like droughts, floods, and high temperatures.
Work Package 2 – Climate Security (WP2): building resilient agricultural systems by understanding the connections between climate, peace, and security
Climate Security is a key focus area for ClimBeR. International, regional, and national organizations are increasingly recognizing the crucial connection between climate, peace, and security. However, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive research that unpacks the intricate dynamics of this relationship. Many donors and governments recognize that climate change acts as a ""threat multiplier,"" meaning it can exacerbate existing risks and insecurities in agricultural communities, increasing the chances of conflict and instability.
To address the lack of strong, localized, and policy-focused evidence about these risks, researchers led by the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT, through CGIAR FOCUS Climate Security, have developed analysis, tools and guidelines to characterize the climate security nexus and provide recommendations for policy and programming that aims to tackle this issue. A central element of the activities was the establishment of strategic partnerships with local and regional government bodies, civil society and organizations to raise awareness on climate security and advance this agenda at regional, national and local levels.
Two years after the launch of the initiative, this evaluation sought to understand the influence of ClimBeR in motivating actors to address climate security in the five countries where WP2 activities were

developed: Guatemala, Kenya, Philippines, Senegal and Zambia. It employed an innovative approach based on the Digital Methods epistemology and Machine Learning techniques to assess digital content that could provide insights about the reach of the initiative at various levels. This report describes the methodology and presents the main findings from the research carried out between June-November 2024.
The Digital Methods approach
The pervasiveness of the internet in people’s lives is undeniable. According to the latest data1, more than 66 percent of the world’s population now use the internet, with the latest data putting the global user total at 5.35 billion. Statistics also show that active social media user identities have passed the 5 billion mark, with the latest user figure equivalent to 62.3 percent of the world’s population2.
The internet has been increasingly integrated into existing offline practices and social relationships, rather than existing as a separate dimension. This hybridization of online and offline realities has effectively established the internet as a space for research on social phenomena. Among various epistemological approaches, 'Digital Methods' (Rogers, 2013, 2015) is defined as the provision of techniques to explain social phenomena through online dynamics, with the web as the data set.
Online spaces offer ample opportunities for analyzing and visualizing trends in contemporary issues due to several aspects: issue traces are accessible online; the analytics leverage on the dynamic features and affordances of online media; and digital platforms provide data (for instance, metadata, links, hashtags, mentions, etc.) that can be structured for systematic analysis (Carneiro, Resce, & Sapkota, 2022).
Employing Digital Methods to assess the influence of WP2 – Climate Security
Relying on innovative research methods that leverage digital platforms as proxies for wider public discourse and engagement, this study explored the influence of ClimBeR’s WP2 through data analytics, with the application of machine learning techniques primarily focused on text mining and network analysis of content disseminated on the web (social media and websites).
Based on the analytical framework employed to map the policy influence of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) (Carneiro, Resce, Läderach, et al., 2022) and CIMMYT’s climate change research portfolio (Carneiro, Resce, & Sapkota, 2022) the research assesses the process of knowledge dissemination of WP2 activities and changes in the discourse of initiative partners by considering online networks and narratives as evidence of “offline” program influence.
The main questions we explore are:
1. Has ClimBeR helped raise awareness of the linkages between climate, peace, and security?
2. Has the initiative motivated its partners to adopt a climate security lens in their public communications?

2. Methodology
While ClimBeR outcomes monitoring includes reporting on the number of policies, legal instruments, and investments that have been informed by the Initiative’s research, these indicators may not be capturing the full extent of the program’s influence, as it does not consider the processes that enable policy or investment decisions. In such cases, ‘soft power’ plays an important role in raising awareness and shaping perceptions of climate security implications to adaptation. The analysis provides a current perspective on the institutional and policy discourses that have not yet been translated into formal documents.
Based on this notion, the text mining approach proposed by Carneiro et al (2022) was adapted to account for the specificities of ClimBeR’s WP2. Two main adjustments were made. First, the taxonomy development combined a data-driven technique with expert consultation to ensure the appropriate concepts were captured in the text analysis. Secondly, the text mining analysis included data from social media (the platform X, formerly Twitter) and websites of initiative partners.
Mapping partners’ online presence
As a starting point, the regional hubs of CGIAR FOCUS Climate Security identified the partnerships and institutional engagements developed over the course of the initiative’s WP2 implementation. Figure 1 presents the distribution of partners identified, 114 in total, with Zambia and Philippines presenting the lowest numbers due to activities in those countries beginning at a later stage in the initiative.
A digital platforms mapping exercise was carried out to identify the main platforms used by these partners, which determined that a significant majority maintained institutional websites and active profiles on X (formerly Twitter). In total, 107 partners had websites (94%) and 104 has X profiles (91%).

Data Collection
Social media: X (formerly Twitter)
Data was collected from X profiles affiliated with project partners to gain insights into social media discourse across diverse geographic regions. The platform was chosen due to its importance as a digital forum for information exchanges and dialogue, and its role in hosting discussions on climate and environmental issues (Pearce et al., 2019). The dataset includes 134 Twitter/X accounts connected to partners in the five countries considered in the analysis. This figure is higher than the number of partners as some institutions maintained more than one profile.
Data acquisition was achieved using a custom Python script that accessed platform endpoints. The script was designed as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, utilizing the Luigi package to manage workflows. The script takes as input the list of 134 accounts from a JSON file and, for each account, creates a task that scrapes the entire timeline. Each tweet is parsed for relevant information, and the results are saved in a TSV file. This design allows for the efficient recovery of data collection after any failure or interruption, ensuring that the process can resume seamlessly from the last completed operation.
Partner Websites
As part of the analyses’ multi-faceted data collection strategy, a specialized web-scraping process was employed to gather text data from partner websites. Data was collected from over 100 websites associated with the ClimBeR project. In order to retrieve data from websites in the past, we utilized the internet archive Wayback Machine3. This tool enables users to navigate through time and observe the evolution of websites over the years.
A specialized scraping tool, developed using Shell scripting, was employed to automate the extraction of text data. The tool was configured to perform the following tasks:
• Content Download: The tool downloaded only the PDF files and HTML from the web pages linked from the home page of each website. This approach ensured that all text content from the homepage and first-level links was retrieved.
• Web Page Content Extraction: Text was extracted by first cleaning up the HTML.
• PDF File Content Extraction: The tool also identified and extracted text from PDF files linked directly from the home page.
• Storage: The extracted content was then concatenated and compressed before being stored.
This methodology allowed for efficient and thorough data collection.

Description of datasets
Twitter
The data collection process yielded 134 .tsv files, each corresponding to one of the X profiles analyzed. Together, these files occupy approximately 635 MB of storage and contain a cumulative total of 1.43 million tweets, covering a date range from April 2008 to September 2024. Each file holds structured data on the tweets from a specific account, capturing a comprehensive snapshot of social media activity over time.
For each tweet in the dataset, the following fields are included:
• Tweet ID: Unique identifier of the tweet.
• Permalink: URL linking directly to the tweet.
• Date: Timestamp indicating when the tweet was posted.
• Body: Text of the tweet (comprehensive of hashtags, mentions, links)
• User Information: Details of the user who posted the tweet.
• Reply Count: Number of replies to the tweet.
• Like Count: Number of likes received by the tweet.
• Retweet Count: Number of retweets.
Language: Language of the tweet content.
Partner Websites
The scraping of partner websites produced a dataset consisting of a file per website, each containing the concatenated text contents from all the pages and PDF files linked to the homepage of the website. To capture temporal snapshots, a new file was created for each scraping day, enabling the tracking of content changes over time. The use of the Wayback Machine guarantees the comparability of the contents over time, allowing for the analysis of changes in communication. This approach enhances the analysis of the partners' website content, enabling us to ascertain the timing and nature of any changes and their impact on the communication of the partners' activities.
Data analysis
Once the datasets were collected, the analysis was organized into three distinct work streams presented in Figure 2. The key method used was text mining, aimed at capturing and analyzing the multiple meanings embedded in textual data. By combining both qualitative and quantitative text analysis, it was possible to assess content disseminated across websites and social media of ClimBeR’s WP2 partners to determine whether the initiative raised awareness about the linkages between climate, peace, and security.

Work stream 1: Taxonomy development
Our approach began with the creation of a custom taxonomy designed to identify key WP2 terminology from which to map the text from partner sources. For this, machine learning algorithms were applied to perform unsupervised text mining on the titles of 130 research outputs reported by WP2 in CGIAR’s Performance and Results Management System (PRMS) from initiative inception until July 2024.
The algorithm used was the statistical measure tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency), which adjusts the frequency of a term by considering its rarity. The aim of this metric is to assess the importance of a word within a document relative to a broader corpus of documents (Silge & Robinson, 2017). In our context, the tf-idf metric merges two aspects: term frequency, referring to how often a word appears in a title, and inverse document frequency, indicating how uniquely the word is tied to that specific title compared to the overall corpus (Hidalgo & Haussman, 2009).
To identify the most significant words among the most frequent ones, we applied a threshold where tf- idf values greater than or equal to the mean tf-idf plus 1.96 times the standard deviation were considered. This threshold helped highlight terms that are both common in the title and rare across the broader set of documents, making them particularly significant.
The words selected using this method, both unigrams and bigrams, were then assessed, complemented and validated by climate security experts to ensure the most important concepts disseminated by WP2 were captured in the analysis. This final, customized taxonomy forms the key terminology that guided the text analysis process. The final output is shown in Figure 3.

Considering the languages spoken in the countries of analysis, as well as language detection in the X dataset identifying a significant presence of non-English content, the final step was to translate the taxonomy into French (5.25% of tweets) and Spanish (29.1% of tweets) by using Google Translate.

11
Work stream 2: Text analysis
Text mining techniques were applied to determine a similarity measure between the knowledge products generated from WP2 with the discourses of partners, on their websites and on X.
The first step in text mining is pre-processing data. The R package tm (Feinerer & Hornik, 2020) was utilized to clean the text by removing punctuation, stop words (e.g., ”the,” ”is,” ”of”), numbers and special characters and by converting the remaining words to lowercase.
Subsequently, an analysis was conducted to identify and quantify the taxonomic words within the text. Initially, this search was performed by considering only the absolute frequency of the taxonomic words. Following this, the metric Taxonomic Prevalence Index (TPI) was introduced, which indicates the prevalence of words from the taxonomy in relation to the total number of words present in the text. This index is expressed as a percentage, calculated by the ratio of the sum of taxonomic words to the total sum of words in the text.
The Taxonomic Prevalence Index was calculated for each X profile and each website separately, and subsequently aggregated to yield a single overall value for the entire dataset of X and for all the websites considered.
On X, to measure the influence of ClimBeR on its partners, we assessed the change in the Taxonomic Prevalence Index in the content of tweets before and after the initiative’s launch. For the websites, the TPI for 2024 was compared to that of 2020.
To provide an empirical measure of the correlation between ClimBeR taxonomy and text over time and to test whether the correlation after program launch is significant, a linear regression was performed.
Work stream 3: Network analysis
Using the dataset collected from X, it was possible to assess CGIAR’s place within its network of WP2 partners by analyzing profiled mentioned in partner tweets. A network analysis was performed to explore the relationship between accounts mentioned in the corpus. Network analysis techniques enable the visualization of relational data organized as matrices, where entities are the nodes – in this case, @mentions – and their relations are the lines connecting pairs of nodes. This means that accounts are connected if they are mentioned by another.
The network analysis considers only tweets in which words from the taxonomy were detected, ensuring that mentions are present in the context of conversations about climate security. A force-directed algorithm was used to construct the network displays. Force-directed graphs show the spatialization of nodes by mapping the proximity and the authority of categories in relation to each other (Jacomy et al., 2014). This means that linked nodes are drawn closer while unrelated nodes are pushed farther apart, thus allowing for a visual interpretation of the dynamics between actors in the network. A modularity algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) was applied to identify “communities”, or clusters – as represented by nodes that are more densely connected together than to the rest of the network, and which were colored accordingly.

3. Key Results
Within the social sciences, content analysis methods enable researchers to identify patterns and changes in political agenda over time and across geographies (Brandt, 2019). Based on the principles of Digital Methods, social media activity can act as a proxy for how ClimBeR WP2 activity influences stakeholders, and how stakeholders in turn amplify the program’s mission to a broader audience. The following section presents the results of our analysis of partners' X profiles and websites.
Social media (X)
The period of analysis for X data was from January 2019 to September 2024. From 134 profiles, a subset of 630 thousand tweets were considered. Figure 4 presents an example of a partner tweet with the presence of terms from the WP2 taxonomy.

Figure 4 Examples of partner tweets with the presence of the WP2 taxonomy.
The word cloud in Figure 5 highlights the most frequent terms used in tweets and allows us to identify the dominant topics of the conversation. In this representation, the largest words are those used most frequently. The most prominent words are violence, security, and peace, suggesting that a significant portion of discussions focused on the security dimension of climate security. Other frequent terms include humanitarian, migration and gender, highlighting the complex linkages between climate insecurity and other social dimensions.

Figure 5: Word cloud of most frequent taxonomy words in tweets
For each account, the Taxonomy Prevalence Index (TPI) was calculated, revealing that conversations about climate security were present in less than 5% of content disseminated by partners. While this figure may seem low, it is important to note that most institutions engaged with WP2 are not climate security-focused, but rather, operate in diverse fields across the HDP Nexus or at the governmental domain.
However, it is important to note that both the absolute word frequency and the TPI, in isolation, are not sufficient indicators of how WP2 has influenced partners' communication strategies. To assess whether there was an increase in awareness concerning climate, peace, and security, along with an evolution in the narrative surrounding these themes, a comparison was made between the TPI values before and after the launch of ClimBeR. This analysis was possible due to the availability of 118 accounts that published tweets in both periods under investigation.
As illustrated in Figure 6, the results demonstrate a marked increase in the TPI following the launch of ClimBeR, with 81 profiles (70%) showing an upward trend in their respective indices.

Aggregating the results without distinction by individual account, a slight increase is evident. The Taxonomy Prevalence Index (TPI) before 2022 stood at an average of 1.04%, while after the launch of the initiative it rose to 1.06%. Although small, considering the length of the program and a thematic focus that is still emerging and was novel to several local partners, this change indicates an achievement regarding increased attention dedicated by partners to issues around climate, peace and security.
To provide an empirical assessment of TPI over time and to evaluate whether the correlation observed after the project's inception is statistically significant, a linear regression analysis was conducted. Table 1 shows that on average, when moving from AfterClimber = 0 to AfterClimber = 1, the prevalence increases by approximately 0.0008percentage points, and the p value of 3,07e^-08 indicates this change is statistically significant.

Key messages
{ Coastal Bangladesh, with its unique geographic and climatic conditions, faces distinct agricultural challenges, now exacerbated by climate change.
Why focus on the agricultural extension process?
{ Providing agricultural extension services, the process of increasing farmers’ awareness of, and access to relevant skills, research, knowledge, inputs, and technology, is one of the ways in which the country has tried to deal with those challenges.
Agricultural extension services support and empower those engaged in agricultural production by helping them solve challenges and access the necessary information, skills, and technologies to enhance their livelihoods and well-being (Dragic et al. 2009; Christoplos 2010; Anaeto et al. 2012). Quality extension services enhance agricultural development by emphasizing the active engagement of recipients, and responsiveness to their real needs. Extension agents have a pivotal role in this process, fostering a collaborative approach between service providers and recipients to drive meaningful progress in the agricultural sector.
{ However, the process of agricultural extension is itself not without its challenges, including the availability of resources, connections, and collaboration between the agents involved, inclusion, and effectiveness.
{ This study examines the process of agricultural extension on the ground from the perspective of its providers (extension agents) and its recipients (community members/farmers), based on interviews with, and stories shared by several members of both groups in Khulna District. This helps us highlight the underexplored importance of farmers’ agency in supporting the effectiveness of the extension process.
{ Our findings emphasize that a deliberate consideration of community members as active participants who can and do shape the process of extension, the creation of bottom-up information flows, and the reframing of extension as a grounded, ongoing process in policy can have a positive impact on both inclusion
The agricultural extension system in Bangladesh has evolved from purely public services to a more broad-ranging framework that includes private, non-governmental, and community-based organizations. Coastal Bangladesh, with its unique geographic and climatic conditions, faces distinct agricultural challenges such as salinity, scarcity of surface water, and waterlogging. Despite significant policy support and government commitment, agricultural extension services are not equally accessible to all. In addition, extension services are increasingly been driven by isolated project funding rather than by sectoral (public) investments. It is often argued that the adoption of new technologies and agricultural innovations tends to be low among smallholder farmers (Alam et al. 2024), women farmers in particular (Rashid et al. 2018; Medendorp et al. 2022). Our study shows that multiple factors can lead to the exclusion of specific community groups from accessing agricultural extension services and interventions.
Among smallholder farmers, the systemic, structural barriers adversely impacting productivity in, and incomes from agriculture include intragenerational declines in average plot sizes and the distress sale of land or livestock largely due to increasing climate impacts. They also result in increasingly unequal competition for water and related resources. Poor productivity and low profitability in smallholder agri-food systems-based livelihoods results in the seasonal migration of mostly adult men as a coping strategy, especially in the climate-impacted southern coastal regions (Chowdhury et al. 2022; Lam et al. 2022). However, a key finding of this study is that there is a mismatch between how extension workers provide information and how community members access it (Rahman et al. 2024). Building on this insight, through story collection (Figure 1), this policy brief aims to identify the barriers to inclusive extension services and propose actionable recommendations to enhance the inclusivity and effectiveness of agricultural extension services in coastal Bangladesh.

Research methodology
To collect first-hand experiences from community members and extension workers, we used a digital ethnographic tool and platform called SenseMaker. It is designed to capture individual, embodied experiences, attitudes, and perceptions, combining relatively large volumes of data with qualitative stories and allowing participants to interpret their stories (Joshi et al. 2023). This is done through the design of a ‘signification framework’ that captures contextual, embodied experiences from respondents and allows them to share what the experiences mean to them, revealing attitudes in the process.
Linear assumptions are avoided by capturing multiple interacting factors, most of which have to do with lived experiences, values, beliefs, and attitudes (van der Merwe et al. 2019). This process enables insights into unique personal experiences, experiences of agency or vulnerability, and how the respondents perceive challenges, risks, and opportunities in their everyday lives (Joshi et al. 2023).
Using this method, we collected stories from 537 community members in Polder 34/2 of Batiaghata Upazila, Khulna District, and 54 local agricultural extension actors in Batiaghata Upazila and more broadly Khulna District. First, we recorded each participant’s story and then supported them in using the ‘signification framework’ to make sense of their stories related to extension services from their own perspectives. The quantitative output of this process of sense- making, outlined in Figure 2, as well as the stories themselves, make up the material presented in this policy brief.
The SenseMaker tool allows us to approach complex questions, where context is key and where linear relationships between cause and effect cannot be assumed.

Key findings
1. Both the benefits of, and the exclusions from agricultural extension training suggest the potential benefits of widening access to formal extension know-how
As Figure 3 indicates, community members who received formal agricultural extension training shared more very positive stories compared to those who did not (roughly 31 percent compared to 20 percent) and fewer negative (roughly 10% compared to 19%) and very negative ones. Although one should be cautious about drawing a direct
causal link between such training and the more positive emotional tone of experiences reported, we can at least conclude that training is part of a cluster of factors and influences that lead to more positive stories emerging in the practice of agriculture, and as such has a role to play. Because it has a role to play, it is important to consider how it is currently affected by exclusions and limitations; both our data and other research (Medendorp et al. 2022; Adnan et al. 2023) suggest that formal agricultural extension is available mostly to landowning farmers and to men – in some cases because it intentionally targets them, and in others because the processes through which these services are offered make it more accessible to farmers with more resources, voice, and visibility.

Figures 4 and 5 indicate how women, landless/tenant farmers, and other marginalized community members are impacted by the exclusionary nature of extension training. The landless tend to be mostly excluded from these trainings (Figure 4); however, because they are still farmers (as tenants), they rely on observing what other farmers are practicing and draw lessons and inspiration from that. However, they often end up with more negative stories (35 percent). For women (Figure 5), training in a public space is often limited due to
patriarchal social norms regarding women’s mobility. This explains why they associate direct access to an agricultural officer with more positive stories (about 18%). Similarly, like landless farmers, women also rely on trying to acquire knowledge by simply observing others. This is unfortunately associated with more negative than positive stories. The narrative in Box 1 illustrates the difference between having access to consistent information and support and trying to figure out things on one’s own.

Box 1. The need for consistent agricultural extension services support.
2. Farmers are active and willing extension agents themselves, but they are not always recognized for this
I currently cultivate sesame, lentils, and sunflower. I started cultivating sunflower on the advice of government agricultural officials two years ago. They provided me with seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides free of cost. With their assistance, I have obtained good yields from sunflower cultivation. Our oil needs are fulfilled throughout the year with this sunflower oil. So, we do not have to buy oil from the market. That is why I have cultivated sunflower this year as well. I haven’t achieved results yet, but I hope to get good yields.
Last year, during the summer, I attempted to cultivate boro rice on my own initiative. However, the yield was not good at all. My crops were destroyed by pests and due to insufficient supply of freshwater. I tried using pesticides, as recommended by people, but it did not work. During rice planting, I got no intelligent advice from anyone. We did not understand many things and did not get results. That is why I did not cultivate boro rice this year.
The stories and data shared confirm again and again that farmers are, and see themselves as active agents of agricultural extension, despite not being formal extension agents. This strength and commitment, if harnessed and supported, can revolutionize agricultural extension policy, and address the resource/financial challenges currently impacting the sector. This becomes apparent in how they make sense of their own stories (see Figure 6). The triangular graphs (triads) were offered to participants to allow them to self-interpret their stories. They did that by showing where it fit in relation to the three corners (see Figure 2 for the process). The visualization aggregates all stories. This combination can then be sliced to reveal particular perspectives, like in Figure 6. In Figure 6, we see that farmers/community members, when asked “Who worked to create change in your story?” see themselves as the most active agents in the greatest share of stories – 41 percent. Extension agents, on the other hand, only acknowledge the agency and participation of community members in 9 percent of the stories.

The story shared in Box 2 provides context to what that active exercise of agency looks like: the farmers, working to improve their yields and circumstances, actively seeking out information from multiple sources, essentially reaching out to any resources available to them. The story also shows how they will enthusiastically apply public extension policy made available through a specific project, supplement this support with other sources or resources, and apply these in situations in which public extension services are not available. This confirms two aspects that have major importance for policy: one, extension service agents must recognize and capitalize on the active agency of farmers (something that Figure 6 suggests is not in place yet), and two, that farmers themselves have the capacity to act as the nexus where multiple sources of extension, public and private, meet. The latter applies especially in the transfer of extension know-how to those excluded from formal services and training.
Interestingly, the data shown in Figure 7 suggest that the less support they have, the more farmers feel they have to take action themselves; farmers who did not receive training view themselves exclusively as active agents in 60 percent of the stories, while those who did get trained ‘surrender’ some of that agency to extension agents (30 percent). This has two further implications for policy: on the one hand, it confirms that attempts to create change in agriculture will go on, with or without the intervention and support of extension services. The other is that awareness of the careful balance between supporting farmers, but not over-directing them, is always important.
Box 2. Farmers seeking out multiple sources of information.
In Botiaghata Upazila, there are farmers who cultivate various types of vegetables like lady’s-finger. After observing their cultivation, I wanted to do the same and obtained some information from them. First, I prepared the land, planted the seeds, leveled the land, and applied fertilizer. When I encountered any problems, I would seek advice from the medicine dealer. When the CIP project arrived, the agricultural officer [anonymized] also provided farming-related information and motivated me. The project workers also offered significant assistance. The cost of cultivating lady’s-finger is not too high, and with proper care, one can achieve higher yields. I cultivated it on a small plot of land, but it requires ample water for irrigation. The cultivation cost was around BDT 5,000–6,000 (USD 50), and I sold the lady’s-finger for about BDT 25,000 (USD 210).

3. It is important to adjust the process of providing agricultural extension services to the lived experiences of farmers
Our data, illustrated in Figure 8, show the mismatch between how extension agents (in blue) say they provided information and how farmers (in green) say that they received information.
These discrepancies suggest that extension agents might be, on the one hand, overestimating the impacts of structured group discussions and exhibition plots, and on the other, underutilizing powerful existing information dissemination pathways, such as local service staff and peer-to-peer knowledge flows.

It is perhaps this overemphasis on formal training methods that lead extension agents, on being asked which elements had an impact in the story they shared, to place much more emphasis on tools and methods as affecting stories of change (28 percent compared to farmers’ 10 percent; see Figure 9), and much less emphasis on support than community members do. This provides an additional line of evidence to support the need to meet farmers where they are. Finally, the stories in Box 3 illustrate more graphically what the data show; how farmers will pass information from peer to peer, as against the extension agents’ emphasis on getting advice from ‘reliable’ sources.
Box 3. Different responses of a farmer and extension agent.
As I could not work myself, I sent some laborers for transplanting rice seedlings and they sowed them too deeply into the soil. Sowing seedlings deeply into soil makes the crop prone to white rot disease. Without taking advice from others, I applied some pesticides following a suggestion from my cousin. Then everything was good, and I got a good yield.
– A male tenant farmer
Once, a farmer with a diseased rice plant came to my office. Our guard told him that I was busy, but I heard it from inside. I wasn’t busy at that time, so I called him in. He showed me the affected plant, and though the problem was evident, I told him I would come and inspect his field because without inspecting, I could not provide any advice. On visiting his field, I realized that his crop was affected by a fungal disease. The proper use of fungicide could cure it. But instead of consulting the right person, he sought advice from people around him and sometimes took advice from people running fertilizer and pesticide shops. As a consequence, he spent around BDT 2,500 [USD 20] on pesticides for his one-bigha land. Eventually, he did not achieve any success. His plants became significantly weaker. Later, after following my advice, he achieved some satisfactory results in the end.

Policy implications
{ The role of farmers as active creators, instigators, and propagators of change suggests the need to alter how they are perceived and, potentially, the ways they are involved in agricultural extension services. Farmers are the key to ensuring that public extension services shape the agenda of agricultural extension towards greater coherence and that the multiple types of extension services work together.
{ Farmers’ continuous energy and activity for improvements in their agricultural practices means they must be actively consulted and included in the design of how and where extension services are delivered. This should especially apply to women and landless farmers who are currently less able to reap the benefits of agricultural extension services. Farmers can offer practical guidance on where impact can be achieved if actively included. Moreover, public extension services will be able to ensure to a greater degree that they are not leaving significant gaps behind that other agents (for example, commercial agents) will step in to fill. Very importantly, through that process, farmers themselves can be equipped to know and judge for themselves which information makes sense, and why. Offering farmers this type of meta-skill through greater inclusion would introduce greater coherence between different sources of advice and ensure that they are shielded from recommendations that have primarily commercial interests in mind.
{ A more active inclusion of farmer advice in shaping how extension services are delivered will enable part of another policy recommendation: more bottom-up information flows that allow for local accommodation and adjustments and give decision-makers a more accurate picture of ground information. Farmers and community members are not the only people who need to be included in the process in substantive ways. Local agriculture officers also need to be considered not just as the disseminators of extension information and services but also as the providers of information to extension organizations on local issues and how they impact the effectiveness of intervention.
{ Finally, roles with active involvement at the local scale, such as certain kinds of agricultural officers who work directly with communities, are also crucial for continuous engagement with agricultural practice; given that farmers’ need for support is ongoing and changing, and not based on specific projects, the structure of extension service delivery needs to meet them where they are.

Key messages
{ Coastal Bangladesh, with its unique geographic and climatic conditions, faces distinct agricultural challenges, now exacerbated by climate change.
Why focus on the agricultural extension process?
{ Providing agricultural extension services, the process of increasing farmers’ awareness of, and access to relevant skills, research, knowledge, inputs, and technology, is one of the ways in which the country has tried to deal with those challenges.
Agricultural extension services support and empower those engaged in agricultural production by helping them solve challenges and access the necessary information, skills, and technologies to enhance their livelihoods and well-being (Dragic et al. 2009; Christoplos 2010; Anaeto et al. 2012). Quality extension services enhance agricultural development by emphasizing the active engagement of recipients, and responsiveness to their real needs. Extension agents have a pivotal role in this process, fostering a collaborative approach between service providers and recipients to drive meaningful progress in the agricultural sector.
{ However, the process of agricultural extension is itself not without its challenges, including the availability of resources, connections, and collaboration between the agents involved, inclusion, and effectiveness.
{ This study examines the process of agricultural extension on the ground from the perspective of its providers (extension agents) and its recipients (community members/farmers), based on interviews with, and stories shared by several members of both groups in Khulna District. This helps us highlight the underexplored importance of farmers’ agency in supporting the effectiveness of the extension process.
{ Our findings emphasize that a deliberate consideration of community members as active participants who can and do shape the process of extension, the creation of bottom-up information flows, and the reframing of extension as a grounded, ongoing process in policy can have a positive impact on both inclusion
The agricultural extension system in Bangladesh has evolved from purely public services to a more broad-ranging framework that includes private, non-governmental, and community-based organizations. Coastal Bangladesh, with its unique geographic and climatic conditions, faces distinct agricultural challenges such as salinity, scarcity of surface water, and waterlogging. Despite significant policy support and government commitment, agricultural extension services are not equally accessible to all. In addition, extension services are increasingly been driven by isolated project funding rather than by sectoral (public) investments. It is often argued that the adoption of new technologies and agricultural innovations tends to be low among smallholder farmers (Alam et al. 2024), women farmers in particular (Rashid et al. 2018; Medendorp et al. 2022). Our study shows that multiple factors can lead to the exclusion of specific community groups from accessing agricultural extension services and interventions.
Among smallholder farmers, the systemic, structural barriers adversely impacting productivity in, and incomes from agriculture include intragenerational declines in average plot sizes and the distress sale of land or livestock largely due to increasing climate impacts. They also result in increasingly unequal competition for water and related resources. Poor productivity and low profitability in smallholder agri-food systems-based livelihoods results in the seasonal migration of mostly adult men as a coping strategy, especially in the climate-impacted southern coastal regions (Chowdhury et al. 2022; Lam et al. 2022). However, a key finding of this study is that there is a mismatch between how extension workers provide information and how community members access it (Rahman et al. 2024). Building on this insight, through story collection (Figure 1), this policy brief aims to identify the barriers to inclusive extension services and propose actionable recommendations to enhance the inclusivity and effectiveness of agricultural extension services in coastal Bangladesh.

Research methodology
To collect first-hand experiences from community members and extension workers, we used a digital ethnographic tool and platform called SenseMaker. It is designed to capture individual, embodied experiences, attitudes, and perceptions, combining relatively large volumes of data with qualitative stories and allowing participants to interpret their stories (Joshi et al. 2023). This is done through the design of a ‘signification framework’ that captures contextual, embodied experiences from respondents and allows them to share what the experiences mean to them, revealing attitudes in the process.
Linear assumptions are avoided by capturing multiple interacting factors, most of which have to do with lived experiences, values, beliefs, and attitudes (van der Merwe et al. 2019). This process enables insights into unique personal experiences, experiences of agency or vulnerability, and how the respondents perceive challenges, risks, and opportunities in their everyday lives (Joshi et al. 2023).
Using this method, we collected stories from 537 community members in Polder 34/2 of Batiaghata Upazila, Khulna District, and 54 local agricultural extension actors in Batiaghata Upazila and more broadly Khulna District. First, we recorded each participant’s story and then supported them in using the ‘signification framework’ to make sense of their stories related to extension services from their own perspectives. The quantitative output of this process of sense- making, outlined in Figure 2, as well as the stories themselves, make up the material presented in this policy brief.
The SenseMaker tool allows us to approach complex questions, where context is key and where linear relationships between cause and effect cannot be assumed.

Key findings
1. Both the benefits of, and the exclusions from agricultural extension training suggest the potential benefits of widening access to formal extension know-how
As Figure 3 indicates, community members who received formal agricultural extension training shared more very positive stories compared to those who did not (roughly 31 percent compared to 20 percent) and fewer negative (roughly 10% compared to 19%) and very negative ones. Although one should be cautious about drawing a direct
causal link between such training and the more positive emotional tone of experiences reported, we can at least conclude that training is part of a cluster of factors and influences that lead to more positive stories emerging in the practice of agriculture, and as such has a role to play. Because it has a role to play, it is important to consider how it is currently affected by exclusions and limitations; both our data and other research (Medendorp et al. 2022; Adnan et al. 2023) suggest that formal agricultural extension is available mostly to landowning farmers and to men – in some cases because it intentionally targets them, and in others because the processes through which these services are offered make it more accessible to farmers with more resources, voice, and visibility.

Neither
Very good Good bad nor good Both Bad Very bad 0.0 12.5 Bf Received training (%) 25.0 37.5 50.0 B Did not receive training (%)
Figures 4 and 5 indicate how women, landless/tenant farmers, and other marginalized community members are impacted by the exclusionary nature of extension training. The landless tend to be mostly excluded from these trainings (Figure 4); however, because they are still farmers (as tenants), they rely on observing what other farmers are practicing and draw lessons and inspiration from that. However, they often end up with more negative stories (35 percent). For women (Figure 5), training in a public space is often limited due to
patriarchal social norms regarding women’s mobility. This explains why they associate direct access to an agricultural officer with more positive stories (about 18%). Similarly, like landless farmers, women also rely on trying to acquire knowledge by simply observing others. This is unfortunately associated with more negative than positive stories. The narrative in Box 1 illustrates the difference between having access to consistent information and support and trying to figure out things on one’s own.

Box 1. The need for consistent agricultural extension services support.
2. Farmers are active and willing extension agents themselves, but they are not always recognized for this
I currently cultivate sesame, lentils, and sunflower. I started cultivating sunflower on the advice of government agricultural officials two years ago. They provided me with seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides free of cost. With their assistance, I have obtained good yields from sunflower cultivation. Our oil needs are fulfilled throughout the year with this sunflower oil. So, we do not have to buy oil from the market. That is why I have cultivated sunflower this year as well. I haven’t achieved results yet, but I hope to get good yields.
Last year, during the summer, I attempted to cultivate boro rice on my own initiative. However, the yield was not good at all. My crops were destroyed by pests and due to insufficient supply of freshwater. I tried using pesticides, as recommended by people, but it did not work. During rice planting, I got no intelligent advice from anyone. We did not understand many things and did not get results. That is why I did not cultivate boro rice this year.
The stories and data shared confirm again and again that farmers are, and see themselves as active agents of agricultural extension, despite not being formal extension agents. This strength and commitment, if harnessed and supported, can revolutionize agricultural extension policy, and address the resource/financial challenges currently impacting the sector. This becomes apparent in how they make sense of their own stories (see Figure 6). The triangular graphs (triads) were offered to participants to allow them to self-interpret their stories. They did that by showing where it fit in relation to the three corners (see Figure 2 for the process). The visualization aggregates all stories. This combination can then be sliced to reveal particular perspectives, like in Figure 6. In Figure 6, we see that farmers/community members, when asked “Who worked to create change in your story?” see themselves as the most active agents in the greatest share of stories – 41 percent. Extension agents, on the other hand, only acknowledge the agency and participation of community members in 9 percent of the stories.

The story shared in Box 2 provides context to what that active exercise of agency looks like: the farmers, working to improve their yields and circumstances, actively seeking out information from multiple sources, essentially reaching out to any resources available to them. The story also shows how they will enthusiastically apply public extension policy made available through a specific project, supplement this support with other sources or resources, and apply these in situations in which public extension services are not available. This confirms two aspects that have major importance for policy: one, extension service agents must recognize and capitalize on the active agency of farmers (something that Figure 6 suggests is not in place yet), and two, that farmers themselves have the capacity to act as the nexus where multiple sources of extension, public and private, meet. The latter applies especially in the transfer of extension know-how to those excluded from formal services and training.
Interestingly, the data shown in Figure 7 suggest that the less support they have, the more farmers feel they have to take action themselves; farmers who did not receive training view themselves exclusively as active agents in 60 percent of the stories, while those who did get trained ‘surrender’ some of that agency to extension agents (30 percent). This has two further implications for policy: on the one hand, it confirms that attempts to create change in agriculture will go on, with or without the intervention and support of extension services. The other is that awareness of the careful balance between supporting farmers, but not over-directing them, is always important.
Box 2. Farmers seeking out multiple sources of information.
In Botiaghata Upazila, there are farmers who cultivate various types of vegetables like lady’s-finger. After observing their cultivation, I wanted to do the same and obtained some information from them. First, I prepared the land, planted the seeds, leveled the land, and applied fertilizer. When I encountered any problems, I would seek advice from the medicine dealer. When the CIP project arrived, the agricultural officer [anonymized] also provided farming-related information and motivated me. The project workers also offered significant assistance. The cost of cultivating lady’s-finger is not too high, and with proper care, one can achieve higher yields. I cultivated it on a small plot of land, but it requires ample water for irrigation. The cultivation cost was around BDT 5,000–6,000 (USD 50), and I sold the lady’s-finger for about BDT 25,000 (USD 210).

3. It is important to adjust the process of providing agricultural extension services to the lived experiences of farmers
Our data, illustrated in Figure 8, show the mismatch between how extension agents (in blue) say they provided information and how farmers (in green) say that they received information.
These discrepancies suggest that extension agents might be, on the one hand, overestimating the impacts of structured group discussions and exhibition plots, and on the other, underutilizing powerful existing information dissemination pathways, such as local service staff and peer-to-peer knowledge flows.

It is perhaps this overemphasis on formal training methods that lead extension agents, on being asked which elements had an impact in the story they shared, to place much more emphasis on tools and methods as affecting stories of change (28 percent compared to farmers’ 10 percent; see Figure 9), and much less emphasis on support than community members do. This provides an additional line of evidence to support the need to meet farmers where they are. Finally, the stories in Box 3 illustrate more graphically what the data show; how farmers will pass information from peer to peer, as against the extension agents’ emphasis on getting advice from ‘reliable’ sources.
Box 3. Different responses of a farmer and extension agent.
As I could not work myself, I sent some laborers for transplanting rice seedlings and they sowed them too deeply into the soil. Sowing seedlings deeply into soil makes the crop prone to white rot disease. Without taking advice from others, I applied some pesticides following a suggestion from my cousin. Then everything was good, and I got a good yield.
– A male tenant farmer
Once, a farmer with a diseased rice plant came to my office. Our guard told him that I was busy, but I heard it from inside. I wasn’t busy at that time, so I called him in. He showed me the affected plant, and though the problem was evident, I told him I would come and inspect his field because without inspecting, I could not provide any advice. On visiting his field, I realized that his crop was affected by a fungal disease. The proper use of fungicide could cure it. But instead of consulting the right person, he sought advice from people around him and sometimes took advice from people running fertilizer and pesticide shops. As a consequence, he spent around BDT 2,500 [USD 20] on pesticides for his one-bigha land. Eventually, he did not achieve any success. His plants became significantly weaker. Later, after following my advice, he achieved some satisfactory results in the end.

Policy implications
{ The role of farmers as active creators, instigators, and propagators of change suggests the need to alter how they are perceived and, potentially, the ways they are involved in agricultural extension services. Farmers are the key to ensuring that public extension services shape the agenda of agricultural extension towards greater coherence and that the multiple types of extension services work together.
{ Farmers’ continuous energy and activity for improvements in their agricultural practices means they must be actively consulted and included in the design of how and where extension services are delivered. This should especially apply to women and landless farmers who are currently less able to reap the benefits of agricultural extension services. Farmers can offer practical guidance on where impact can be achieved if actively included. Moreover, public extension services will be able to ensure to a greater degree that they are not leaving significant gaps behind that other agents (for example, commercial agents) will step in to fill. Very importantly, through that process, farmers themselves can be equipped to know and judge for themselves which information makes sense, and why. Offering farmers this type of meta-skill through greater inclusion would introduce greater coherence between different sources of advice and ensure that they are shielded from recommendations that have primarily commercial interests in mind.
{ A more active inclusion of farmer advice in shaping how extension services are delivered will enable part of another policy recommendation: more bottom-up information flows that allow for local accommodation and adjustments and give decision-makers a more accurate picture of ground information. Farmers and community members are not the only people who need to be included in the process in substantive ways. Local agriculture officers also need to be considered not just as the disseminators of extension information and services but also as the providers of information to extension organizations on local issues and how they impact the effectiveness of intervention.
{ Finally, roles with active involvement at the local scale, such as certain kinds of agricultural officers who work directly with communities, are also crucial for continuous engagement with agricultural practice; given that farmers’ need for support is ongoing and changing, and not based on specific projects, the structure of extension service delivery needs to meet them where they are.

This policy brief highlights the key findings from an analysis of relevant policies and institutional mechanisms in India and Bangladesh relating to climate loss and damage in the Sundarbans.
complexity of loss and damage (L&D)1 – which are both economic and non-economic – for local communities are yet to be fully assessed.
Key messages
{ More than 7 million people in the Sundarbans stand to benefit from the historic agreement to operationalize the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage at the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP 28) in 2023.
{ Viewing the Sundarbans region as a continuous transboundary ecosystem, the governments of India and Bangladesh must plan more cohesive national and transboundary loss and damage strategies and mechanisms and enable greater accountability in evaluating fund flow mechanisms.
{ Governance systems in both countries need to distinguish between interventions addressing disaster management, climate adaptation, and mitigation vis-à-vis dedicated funding for addressing the economic and non-economic impacts of loss and damage. This will require greater cross-sectoral coordination and complementarity within existing institutional structures, governance mechanisms, and fund flows.
{ In both countries, there is an urgent need to assess and strengthen resources and capabilities to quantify and compensate for economic and non-economic loss and damage.
Background
In the Sundarbans, the vulnerability, risk and adaptation framework of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is particularly useful in explaining the combined effects of biophysical and social vulnerabilities and overall impacts on adaptation capabilities. The region has historically been at risk to extreme weather events. The Sundarbans has a long history of environmental impacts, an outcome of anthropogenic influences. “Populated since the 8th century, intensification of land use and mangrove clearing escalated from the late-19th century and continued throughout the 20th century” (Sievers et al. 2020). The economic loss in this region was assessed at around USD 25 billion as far back as 2014 (World Bank 2014).
The Sundarbans serves as a buffer against cyclones and storm surges in this deltaic region (Sakib et al. 2015). However, this ecosystem service has been weakened for a significantly long time, dating back to extensive timber harvesting during colonial times. The social vulnerabilities of local communities also date back to this period. Various other socio-economic drivers, such as demographic trends and industrialization upstream along the Hooghly River north of the Sundarbans Delta, have continued over time to increase the ecological and social vulnerability of the region and its inhabitants.
Current trends in greenhouse gas emissions, the limited progress in halting deforestation and in sustainable land use, including ecosystem restoration, and the long-term nature of sea level rise make it increasingly likely that climate impacts will intensify in the Sundarbans. Consequently, greater loss and damage are inevitable. It has been estimated that in business-as-usual scenarios, “by the end of the century, the Indian Sundarbans mangroves could lose between 42% and 80% of their current area,” with multiple cascading biophysical and socio-economic impacts (Samanta et al. 2023). This dual vulnerability of the ecosystem and the local communities is a critical factor to consider in assessing and compensating for loss and damage (Dasgupta et al. 2020).
The Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest in a deltaic region, is an ecologically sensitive zone and a UNESCO World Heritage site that straddles the national boundaries of India and Bangladesh. Parts of the Sundarbans are considered highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The region has seen an alarming rise in both slow and rapid onset climate impacts, including rising temperatures and sea levels, salinity ingress, more frequent and intense cyclones, deforestation, the spread of diseases, breaches in embankments, and increasing human-animal conflicts. These impacts have resulted in substantial and adverse ecological, social, and economic outcomes, but the magnitude and
Comprehensive, long-term adaptation strategies have been identified for enhancing the resilience of the biophysical and socio-economic systems in the Sundarbans that have been eroded over years. However, until then, the region remains “a high-risk transition zone that is most vulnerable to climate change” (Dasgupta et al. 2020). Natural disaster preparedness policies and interventions in both India and Bangladesh unfortunately do not adequately address these historical impacts, nor the rapidly intensifying scale and magnitude of climate impacts and consequential economic and non-economic loss and damage suffered by the local ecology, economy, and communities.
1 The term ‘loss and damage’ refers to the consequences of climate change that transcend people’s ability to adapt to its impacts. It can also generally be understood as the negative impacts of climate change that occur despite, or in the absence of, mitigation and adaptation.
Institutional preparedness to operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund in India and Bangladesh 2 2
Economic and non-economic loss and damage
At the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP 27) in 2022, a Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage was created, dedicated to compensating and addressing the plethora of loss and damage taking place in developing nations, particularly the very vulnerable, due to climate change. It was operationalized the following year, at COP 28 in Dubai. The contributions pledged by a number of countries and the European Union as of mid- November 2024 amount to USD 702 million (UNCC n.d.).
These agreements and decisions, after several years of advocacy by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Small Island Developing States (SIDS), were historic, symbolizing an acknowledgement of the cost of carbon emissions by developed economies on climate-vulnerable developing economies. However, these pledges cover less than 0.2 percent of the actual economic loss and damage incurred by developing countries annually. “In Bangladesh, rural households have been shown to spend almost USD 2 billion on disaster preparedness and response. This amounts to double the government climate and disaster risk reduction spending and is over 12 times higher than multilateral international financing for Bangladesh’s rural population. Measured as share of income, women also spend three times more than men on climate and disaster” (Eskander and Steele 2019).
Although this distinction is useful, it does not fully help explain the significant social upheaval resulting from economic and non-economic loss and damage (Matthew et al. 2023; Bhandari et al. 2024). Economic losses, such as the loss of livelihoods, have compound, multiplier impacts on non-economic losses, so much so that this distinction can often be abstract. For example, the loss of income and livelihoods can result in the migration of (some or all) family members, which has both immediate and long-term impacts on social cohesion and well-being (Ayeb-Karlsson et al. 2023; Members of The Loss and Damage Collaboration 2023; UNEP 2023). These types of interconnected, overlapping, and cascading impacts in the Sundarbans due to chronic (slow-onset) and acute (extreme) events that result in a state of “beyond adaptation” (Stout 2023) have not been well documented. Current assessments of L&D tend to focus on economic valuations, which have been critiqued for not adequately covering the complexity and severity of non- economic impacts of climate change, particularly how people experience loss and how they value relational changes to their lives and future (Tschakert et al. 2017).
Assessing L&D is also complex because it is hard to isolate the impacts of increased greenhouse emissions alone. Multiple anthropogenic drivers—including financial, governance, and institutional arrangements—can have diverse impacts on water resources, food security, agriculture, and livelihood opportunities (Datta et al. 2024), resulting in both economic and non-economic impacts. Evaluating the total quantum of loss and damage—economic and non-economic—is difficult also because these impacts “are not experienced equally;
There are many other challenges to operationalizing the Loss and Damage (L&D) Fund, including issues of who should pay how much and on what basis. This includes a lack of consensus on how emissions count as the basis for defining payment obligations. While Bangladesh qualifies as a recipient of the L&D Fund, India’s position, similar to other large, industrializing emerging economies, is contested. India is a significant emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases but has low per capita CO2 emissions.
Despite the agreement on an L&D fund, there is no agreed- upon definition of loss and damage within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Loss and damage could be both economic and non-economic. According to a lead author of the IPCC’s 2022 report on climate impacts and adaptation, economic loss and damage (ELD) are negative climate impacts that can be assigned a monetary value, such as the costs of rebuilding infrastructure that has been damaged due to a flood, or the loss of revenue that ensues when crops are destroyed due to droughts. Non-economic loss and damage (NELD) are negative impacts that are not monetary in nature but important for individuals or communities, such as the trauma from experiencing a tropical cyclone, the fragmentation of a community due to the displacement of people or forced migration of family members, or loss of biodiversity.

they are disproportionately experienced by developing countries and by vulnerable groups, such as people of low socio-economic class, migrant groups, the elderly, women and children.” These impacts pose different challenges for diverse local communities and have been noted to lead to distress migration and the fragmentation of family units with spiraling non-economic loss and damage. Given the complexity of non-economic impacts, including the gendered dimensions of these challenges, they are difficult to assess, let alone address.
Review of policies and institutional strategies in India and Bangladesh
Policy trajectories and institutional mechanisms to cope with the impacts of climate change in the Sundarbans vary significantly between India and Bangladesh. Bangladesh has long advocated institutionalizing and operationalizing mechanisms for L&D at the global level; however, neither country has specific L&D mechanisms or policies and plans in place (Haque et al. 2019; Mohanty 2020). The focus so far has primarily been on addressing immediate disasters through a ‘here and now’ approach.
which has impacted irrigation, increased drinking water stress, and affected the health and well-being of people in the Sundarbans, particularly women.
The Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) has played a pivotal role in advancing the L&D agenda and providing complementary provisions for in-country support, with a focus on technical assistance (primarily through the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage) and finance for responding to L&D. However, current policies, institutional arrangements, and financial instruments in India and Bangladesh do not seem to be sufficiently coordinated to address the long-term and medium-term impacts of L&D.
In both India and Bangladesh, disaster management strategies are well developed and executed to address the immediate management of physical, infrastructural, and material losses caused by environmental crises. However, by design, these interventions—including those in the Sundarbans—are primarily reactive, responding to disasters with ad hoc compensation instead of proactively analyzing, averting, and minimizing economic and non-economic L&D in the region. Policies in both India and Bangladesh do not include mapping non-economic L&D after a disaster, and, as a general practice, funds are not allocated to addressing non-economic issues such as emotional trauma, mental health issues, and counselling in a region deeply affected by growing social upheaval due to a severe climate crisis. There is relatively little attention to other non-economic and intangible L&D from climate change, such as the strain on social bonds and debt-induced anxiety from the loss of homes, other assets, and livelihoods (Ranon 2023).
Addressing the domino effect of slow-onset climate events is not easy, and in both countries, there is significant room to improve the understanding of and responses to the cascading effects of slow-onset and extreme events. This can include policies to deal with the depletion of groundwater reserves, including through rising salinity (Ahmed et al. 2022),
In India, most Sundarbans-specific initiatives tend to be earmarked for ecosystem conservation and protection measures. Strategies that will address the complementarity of disaster preparedness and climate ELD and NELD need to be worked on. Our review of policies in India shows a lack of long-term programs with a dedicated climate L&D focus, including on enabling communities to recover from the

everyday challenges caused by slow-onset events and long- term climate-induced shocks, risks, and losses (Pandit Chhetri et al. 2021).
In sum, there is an urgent need for approaches and methods to map and address economic and non-economic impacts of climate loss and damage. This must include changes to policies, greater sectoral coordination, institutional capacity-building, and a focus on dealing with non- economic losses.
Finally, despite the governments of India and Bangladesh signing a Memorandum of Understanding to co-manage the Sundarbans region as one ecological transboundary system and related policy decisions and agreements being in place, national plans, policies, and interventions show little complementarity in practice. Given the historic announcement in 2023 of the operationalization of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, we highlight the need and opportunity for both countries to adopt a more convergent, integrated approach to addressing L&D more meaningfully.
Recommendations
In light of the above, we make the following policy recommendations:
1. Streamline climate-related institutional and financial mechanisms
To operationalize the L&D funds, preparatory work is crucial in both India and Bangladesh, including integrating L&D into their respective national action plans for climate change. This will allow distinguishing between mechanisms for disaster relief and responding to climate L&D and ensure that necessary funds for mitigation and adaptation are not randomly diverted to dealing with loss and damage. Simultaneously, robust mechanisms (such as the Green Climate Fund in Bangladesh) for the swift disbursal of loss and damage funds must be established, as vulnerable communities are more likely to need them immediately after a sudden climate shock.
2. Enable transboundary assessments and interventions
The operationalization of a global commons approach in conservation and governance initiatives across India and Bangladesh would facilitate joint efforts between the two countries to address climatic challenges in the Sundarbans, including loss and damage. A joint task force to conduct a transboundary assessment of economic and non-economic L&D would help streamline cross-sectoral and cross-boundary institutional and financial strategies. This assessment must include building expertise on the biodiversity of the Sundarbans region.
3. Establish evidence-based planning mechanisms
Currently, there is no analytical framework in place to assess economic and non-economic L&D from both long-term and extreme climate impacts in both countries. Establishing assessment mechanisms regarding these issues in critical climate hotspots such as the Sundarbans can enable the development of institutional and financial systems and structures, establish data (including real-time data), and enable data-driven strategies and interventions that ensure efficiency, accountability, and transparency in the (eventual) disbursement of L&D funds.
4. Align with globally accepted funding architecture
The funding architecture of the UNFCCC provides tools and mechanisms for establishing, expanding, and enhancing community capacities via active technical assistance funding through the Santiago network for loss and damage. These universally accredited scientific protocols can help ensure transparency and accountability in responding to L&D, including risks of loss and damage.
5. Expand financial resources for non-economic loss and damage
There is an increasing call for greater attention to non-economic L&D, including innovative methods and strategies to measure and address these challenges.
6. Facilitate civil society engagement through the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM)
The WIM Executive Committee initiated discussions with the World Bank in March 2024 on transparency, accountability, and fund disbursement mechanisms. National focal institutions from India and Bangladesh could use this opportunity to enable better representation and positioning of critical climate impacts in the voices of local communities in the Sundarbans.
7. Need for gender-integrated and stakeholder-inclusive policies
We recommend integrating a gendered lens in all policies addressing L&D. Build the capacities of a diverse range of stakeholders (including local self-governments, communities, and those who implement policy at the grassroots level) in gender-specific policy formulation. Parties should ensure that gender is included as a crosscutting issue and mainstreamed in all programs, policies, and activities related to L&D.

This policy brief highlights the key findings from an analysis of relevant policies and institutional mechanisms in India and Bangladesh relating to climate loss and damage in the Sundarbans.
complexity of loss and damage (L&D)1 – which are both economic and non-economic – for local communities are yet to be fully assessed.
Key messages
{ More than 7 million people in the Sundarbans stand to benefit from the historic agreement to operationalize the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage at the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP 28) in 2023.
{ Viewing the Sundarbans region as a continuous transboundary ecosystem, the governments of India and Bangladesh must plan more cohesive national and transboundary loss and damage strategies and mechanisms and enable greater accountability in evaluating fund flow mechanisms.
{ Governance systems in both countries need to distinguish between interventions addressing disaster management, climate adaptation, and mitigation vis-à-vis dedicated funding for addressing the economic and non-economic impacts of loss and damage. This will require greater cross-sectoral coordination and complementarity within existing institutional structures, governance mechanisms, and fund flows.
{ In both countries, there is an urgent need to assess and strengthen resources and capabilities to quantify and compensate for economic and non-economic loss and damage.
Background
In the Sundarbans, the vulnerability, risk and adaptation framework of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is particularly useful in explaining the combined effects of biophysical and social vulnerabilities and overall impacts on adaptation capabilities. The region has historically been at risk to extreme weather events. The Sundarbans has a long history of environmental impacts, an outcome of anthropogenic influences. “Populated since the 8th century, intensification of land use and mangrove clearing escalated from the late-19th century and continued throughout the 20th century” (Sievers et al. 2020). The economic loss in this region was assessed at around USD 25 billion as far back as 2014 (World Bank 2014).
The Sundarbans serves as a buffer against cyclones and storm surges in this deltaic region (Sakib et al. 2015). However, this ecosystem service has been weakened for a significantly long time, dating back to extensive timber harvesting during colonial times. The social vulnerabilities of local communities also date back to this period. Various other socio-economic drivers, such as demographic trends and industrialization upstream along the Hooghly River north of the Sundarbans Delta, have continued over time to increase the ecological and social vulnerability of the region and its inhabitants.
Current trends in greenhouse gas emissions, the limited progress in halting deforestation and in sustainable land use, including ecosystem restoration, and the long-term nature of sea level rise make it increasingly likely that climate impacts will intensify in the Sundarbans. Consequently, greater loss and damage are inevitable. It has been estimated that in business-as-usual scenarios, “by the end of the century, the Indian Sundarbans mangroves could lose between 42% and 80% of their current area,” with multiple cascading biophysical and socio-economic impacts (Samanta et al. 2023). This dual vulnerability of the ecosystem and the local communities is a critical factor to consider in assessing and compensating for loss and damage (Dasgupta et al. 2020).
The Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest in a deltaic region, is an ecologically sensitive zone and a UNESCO World Heritage site that straddles the national boundaries of India and Bangladesh. Parts of the Sundarbans are considered highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The region has seen an alarming rise in both slow and rapid onset climate impacts, including rising temperatures and sea levels, salinity ingress, more frequent and intense cyclones, deforestation, the spread of diseases, breaches in embankments, and increasing human-animal conflicts. These impacts have resulted in substantial and adverse ecological, social, and economic outcomes, but the magnitude and
Comprehensive, long-term adaptation strategies have been identified for enhancing the resilience of the biophysical and socio-economic systems in the Sundarbans that have been eroded over years. However, until then, the region remains “a high-risk transition zone that is most vulnerable to climate change” (Dasgupta et al. 2020). Natural disaster preparedness policies and interventions in both India and Bangladesh unfortunately do not adequately address these historical impacts, nor the rapidly intensifying scale and magnitude of climate impacts and consequential economic and non-economic loss and damage suffered by the local ecology, economy, and communities.
1 The term ‘loss and damage’ refers to the consequences of climate change that transcend people’s ability to adapt to its impacts. It can also generally be understood as the negative impacts of climate change that occur despite, or in the absence of, mitigation and adaptation.
Institutional preparedness to operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund in India and Bangladesh 2 2
Economic and non-economic loss and damage
At the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP 27) in 2022, a Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage was created, dedicated to compensating and addressing the plethora of loss and damage taking place in developing nations, particularly the very vulnerable, due to climate change. It was operationalized the following year, at COP 28 in Dubai. The contributions pledged by a number of countries and the European Union as of mid- November 2024 amount to USD 702 million (UNCC n.d.).
These agreements and decisions, after several years of advocacy by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Small Island Developing States (SIDS), were historic, symbolizing an acknowledgement of the cost of carbon emissions by developed economies on climate-vulnerable developing economies. However, these pledges cover less than 0.2 percent of the actual economic loss and damage incurred by developing countries annually. “In Bangladesh, rural households have been shown to spend almost USD 2 billion on disaster preparedness and response. This amounts to double the government climate and disaster risk reduction spending and is over 12 times higher than multilateral international financing for Bangladesh’s rural population. Measured as share of income, women also spend three times more than men on climate and disaster” (Eskander and Steele 2019).
Although this distinction is useful, it does not fully help explain the significant social upheaval resulting from economic and non-economic loss and damage (Matthew et al. 2023; Bhandari et al. 2024). Economic losses, such as the loss of livelihoods, have compound, multiplier impacts on non-economic losses, so much so that this distinction can often be abstract. For example, the loss of income and livelihoods can result in the migration of (some or all) family members, which has both immediate and long-term impacts on social cohesion and well-being (Ayeb-Karlsson et al. 2023; Members of The Loss and Damage Collaboration 2023; UNEP 2023). These types of interconnected, overlapping, and cascading impacts in the Sundarbans due to chronic (slow-onset) and acute (extreme) events that result in a state of “beyond adaptation” (Stout 2023) have not been well documented. Current assessments of L&D tend to focus on economic valuations, which have been critiqued for not adequately covering the complexity and severity of non- economic impacts of climate change, particularly how people experience loss and how they value relational changes to their lives and future (Tschakert et al. 2017).
Assessing L&D is also complex because it is hard to isolate the impacts of increased greenhouse emissions alone. Multiple anthropogenic drivers—including financial, governance, and institutional arrangements—can have diverse impacts on water resources, food security, agriculture, and livelihood opportunities (Datta et al. 2024), resulting in both economic and non-economic impacts. Evaluating the total quantum of loss and damage—economic and non-economic—is difficult also because these impacts “are not experienced equally;
There are many other challenges to operationalizing the Loss and Damage (L&D) Fund, including issues of who should pay how much and on what basis. This includes a lack of consensus on how emissions count as the basis for defining payment obligations. While Bangladesh qualifies as a recipient of the L&D Fund, India’s position, similar to other large, industrializing emerging economies, is contested. India is a significant emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases but has low per capita CO2 emissions.
Despite the agreement on an L&D fund, there is no agreed- upon definition of loss and damage within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Loss and damage could be both economic and non-economic. According to a lead author of the IPCC’s 2022 report on climate impacts and adaptation, economic loss and damage (ELD) are negative climate impacts that can be assigned a monetary value, such as the costs of rebuilding infrastructure that has been damaged due to a flood, or the loss of revenue that ensues when crops are destroyed due to droughts. Non-economic loss and damage (NELD) are negative impacts that are not monetary in nature but important for individuals or communities, such as the trauma from experiencing a tropical cyclone, the fragmentation of a community due to the displacement of people or forced migration of family members, or loss of biodiversity.

The increase in cyclones and flooding has taken a toll on the riverine infrastructure of the Sundarbans (photo: Shibaji Bose).

they are disproportionately experienced by developing countries and by vulnerable groups, such as people of low socio-economic class, migrant groups, the elderly, women and children.” These impacts pose different challenges for diverse local communities and have been noted to lead to distress migration and the fragmentation of family units with spiraling non-economic loss and damage. Given the complexity of non-economic impacts, including the gendered dimensions of these challenges, they are difficult to assess, let alone address.
Review of policies and institutional strategies in India and Bangladesh
Policy trajectories and institutional mechanisms to cope with the impacts of climate change in the Sundarbans vary significantly between India and Bangladesh. Bangladesh has long advocated institutionalizing and operationalizing mechanisms for L&D at the global level; however, neither country has specific L&D mechanisms or policies and plans in place (Haque et al. 2019; Mohanty 2020). The focus so far has primarily been on addressing immediate disasters through a ‘here and now’ approach.
which has impacted irrigation, increased drinking water stress, and affected the health and well-being of people in the Sundarbans, particularly women.
The Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) has played a pivotal role in advancing the L&D agenda and providing complementary provisions for in-country support, with a focus on technical assistance (primarily through the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage) and finance for responding to L&D. However, current policies, institutional arrangements, and financial instruments in India and Bangladesh do not seem to be sufficiently coordinated to address the long-term and medium-term impacts of L&D.
In both India and Bangladesh, disaster management strategies are well developed and executed to address the immediate management of physical, infrastructural, and material losses caused by environmental crises. However, by design, these interventions—including those in the Sundarbans—are primarily reactive, responding to disasters with ad hoc compensation instead of proactively analyzing, averting, and minimizing economic and non-economic L&D in the region. Policies in both India and Bangladesh do not include mapping non-economic L&D after a disaster, and, as a general practice, funds are not allocated to addressing non-economic issues such as emotional trauma, mental health issues, and counselling in a region deeply affected by growing social upheaval due to a severe climate crisis. There is relatively little attention to other non-economic and intangible L&D from climate change, such as the strain on social bonds and debt-induced anxiety from the loss of homes, other assets, and livelihoods (Ranon 2023).
Addressing the domino effect of slow-onset climate events is not easy, and in both countries, there is significant room to improve the understanding of and responses to the cascading effects of slow-onset and extreme events. This can include policies to deal with the depletion of groundwater reserves, including through rising salinity (Ahmed et al. 2022),
In India, most Sundarbans-specific initiatives tend to be earmarked for ecosystem conservation and protection measures. Strategies that will address the complementarity of disaster preparedness and climate ELD and NELD need to be worked on. Our review of policies in India shows a lack of long-term programs with a dedicated climate L&D focus, including on enabling communities to recover from the

everyday challenges caused by slow-onset events and long- term climate-induced shocks, risks, and losses (Pandit Chhetri et al. 2021).
In sum, there is an urgent need for approaches and methods to map and address economic and non-economic impacts of climate loss and damage. This must include changes to policies, greater sectoral coordination, institutional capacity-building, and a focus on dealing with non- economic losses.
Finally, despite the governments of India and Bangladesh signing a Memorandum of Understanding to co-manage the Sundarbans region as one ecological transboundary system and related policy decisions and agreements being in place, national plans, policies, and interventions show little complementarity in practice. Given the historic announcement in 2023 of the operationalization of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, we highlight the need and opportunity for both countries to adopt a more convergent, integrated approach to addressing L&D more meaningfully.
Recommendations
In light of the above, we make the following policy recommendations:
1. Streamline climate-related institutional and financial mechanisms
To operationalize the L&D funds, preparatory work is crucial in both India and Bangladesh, including integrating L&D into their respective national action plans for climate change. This will allow distinguishing between mechanisms for disaster relief and responding to climate L&D and ensure that necessary funds for mitigation and adaptation are not randomly diverted to dealing with loss and damage. Simultaneously, robust mechanisms (such as the Green Climate Fund in Bangladesh) for the swift disbursal of loss and damage funds must be established, as vulnerable communities are more likely to need them immediately after a sudden climate shock.
2. Enable transboundary assessments and interventions
The operationalization of a global commons approach in conservation and governance initiatives across India and Bangladesh would facilitate joint efforts between the two countries to address climatic challenges in the Sundarbans, including loss and damage. A joint task force to conduct a transboundary assessment of economic and non-economic L&D would help streamline cross-sectoral and cross-boundary institutional and financial strategies. This assessment must include building expertise on the biodiversity of the Sundarbans region.
3. Establish evidence-based planning mechanisms
Currently, there is no analytical framework in place to assess economic and non-economic L&D from both long-term and extreme climate impacts in both countries. Establishing assessment mechanisms regarding these issues in critical climate hotspots such as the Sundarbans can enable the development of institutional and financial systems and structures, establish data (including real-time data), and enable data-driven strategies and interventions that ensure efficiency, accountability, and transparency in the (eventual) disbursement of L&D funds.
4. Align with globally accepted funding architecture
The funding architecture of the UNFCCC provides tools and mechanisms for establishing, expanding, and enhancing community capacities via active technical assistance funding through the Santiago network for loss and damage. These universally accredited scientific protocols can help ensure transparency and accountability in responding to L&D, including risks of loss and damage.
5. Expand financial resources for non-economic loss and damage
There is an increasing call for greater attention to non-economic L&D, including innovative methods and strategies to measure and address these challenges.
6. Facilitate civil society engagement through the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM)
The WIM Executive Committee initiated discussions with the World Bank in March 2024 on transparency, accountability, and fund disbursement mechanisms. National focal institutions from India and Bangladesh could use this opportunity to enable better representation and positioning of critical climate impacts in the voices of local communities in the Sundarbans.
7. Need for gender-integrated and stakeholder-inclusive policies
We recommend integrating a gendered lens in all policies addressing L&D. Build the capacities of a diverse range of stakeholders (including local self-governments, communities, and those who implement policy at the grassroots level) in gender-specific policy formulation. Parties should ensure that gender is included as a crosscutting issue and mainstreamed in all programs, policies, and activities related to L&D.

iii. Outcomes and Challenges
The co-design process was a multi-year, iterative collaboration within Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALLs) (Figure 2). The initial phase (Year 1) led to the establishment of demonstration plots [addressing, in particular, the biocontrol of major pests, including fall armyworm (Push-Pull), and adaptation to climate change (Conservation Agriculture-CA)], seed fairs (addressing the lack of adapted planting material), and mechanization services (addressing labor constraints, often exacerbated by the adoption of agroecological practices).
In Year 2, challenges were identified for the co-designed technologies through consultation with the ALLs. These were related to production costs, biomass availability for soil mulching in the CA plot, and the need to increase livestock feed. Also, the demonstration plots progressed into a mother-baby plot design, and seed fairs expanded to seed and livestock fairs, emphasizing community-based knowledge sharing. Farmer performance reviews and feedback loops were integral to adapting strategies. This co-design approach promoted the emergence of locally tailored agroecological practices that responded directly to farmers' needs. The process effectively strengthened partnerships, knowledge exchange, and co-learning.
Challenges
The co-design process faced several notable challenges. A major issue was inconsistent representation from the local private sector and development partners across wards, which limited knowledge-sharing opportunities. Challenges identified by the community, such as inadequate infrastructure, limited access to financial services, and market barriers, often exceeded the project's scope and capacity.
The initial co-design process was conducted when community members were still developing their understanding of agroecology. This extended the community buy-in process, requiring substantial awareness-building and capacity development time.
Communication barriers also posed significant challenges, particularly in conveying scientific concepts in locally understandable terms. Translating agroecological knowledge into practical, locally relevant actions required participatory approaches and iterative dialogue, which often slowed decision-making and led to varied levels of understanding among participants. Furthermore, climate variability remained an ongoing challenge, as unpredictable weather patterns affected the testing and implementation of interventions, particularly during the second season of experimentation (2023/24).

In both Mbire and Murehwa, the 2022/23 season (first season of experimentation, with the establishment in November) was average, but the 2023/24 season was dry compared to the long-term (1990-2000) average, with in particular an unusually dry February-March period in both District (Figures 3 and 4). Maximum temperatures were also several degrees above long-term average I both districts during that period. Due to an El Niño event, this pattern has had severe implications for the performance of the trials during the second season of investigation (see below).

Landscape description
Land slope: flat(0-2%) to gentle(3-5%) in both sites (Figures 3 and 4)
Soil texture class: sandy loam and silt loam soils, with cases of loam soils in both sites (Figures 7 and 8).
Trial setup
Ten on-farm trials were established in each site, with each trial having three non-replicated treatments during the first season of experimentation (2022/23 season) and six during the second season of experimentation (2023/24). The three treatments compared during the first season were conventional practices, conservation agriculture (with ""dead mulch""), and push-pull. Biochar, traditional practices, and conservation agriculture with live mulch were added in the second season. Performances were evaluated on productivity, rainwater use efficiency, and pest biocontrol. The plots were 6 m wide and 24 m long (Figures 11 and 12). Trials were established in mid-December 2022 and are planned to last until March 2025.

In 2023, following the completion of the first cycle of mother demonstration trials, 83 farmers — 64 in Murehwa and 19 in Mbire — within the ALLs selected a minimum of two treatments from the mother trials for adoption and adaptation in their baby fields. In Mbire, most farmers opted for conservation agriculture (with ""dead mulch""), followed by push-pull and conventional practices (Figure 9). In Murehwa, most farmers chose conventional practices, followed by push-pull and conservation agriculture (with ""dead mulch"") (Figure 9). In these baby trials, farmers adhered to the original plot size and spacing used in the mother trials but were free to modify specific practices, including tillage methods, pest control strategies (Figure 10), and soil fertility management. All field activities and management practices were documented. These baby trials were established mid-December 2023 and will last until March 2025.

iii. Outcomes and Challenges
The co-design process was a multi-year, iterative collaboration within Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALLs) (Figure 2). The initial phase (Year 1) led to the establishment of demonstration plots [addressing, in particular, the biocontrol of major pests, including fall armyworm (Push-Pull), and adaptation to climate change (Conservation Agriculture-CA)], seed fairs (addressing the lack of adapted planting material), and mechanization services (addressing labor constraints, often exacerbated by the adoption of agroecological practices).
In Year 2, challenges were identified for the co-designed technologies through consultation with the ALLs. These were related to production costs, biomass availability for soil mulching in the CA plot, and the need to increase livestock feed. Also, the demonstration plots progressed into a mother-baby plot design, and seed fairs expanded to seed and livestock fairs, emphasizing community-based knowledge sharing. Farmer performance reviews and feedback loops were integral to adapting strategies. This co-design approach promoted the emergence of locally tailored agroecological practices that responded directly to farmers' needs. The process effectively strengthened partnerships, knowledge exchange, and co-learning.
Challenges
The co-design process faced several notable challenges. A major issue was inconsistent representation from the local private sector and development partners across wards, which limited knowledge-sharing opportunities. Challenges identified by the community, such as inadequate infrastructure, limited access to financial services, and market barriers, often exceeded the project's scope and capacity.
The initial co-design process was conducted when community members were still developing their understanding of agroecology. This extended the community buy-in process, requiring substantial awareness-building and capacity development time.
Communication barriers also posed significant challenges, particularly in conveying scientific concepts in locally understandable terms. Translating agroecological knowledge into practical, locally relevant actions required participatory approaches and iterative dialogue, which often slowed decision-making and led to varied levels of understanding among participants. Furthermore, climate variability remained an ongoing challenge, as unpredictable weather patterns affected the testing and implementation of interventions, particularly during the second season of experimentation (2023/24).

Climatic and weather conditions:
Mbire receives an average (1991-2000 average) of about 635 mm of rainfall per year, between November and March, with a mean maximum temperature (1991-2000 average) of 33°C (Figure 5). Murehwa receives an average (1991-2000 average) of about 875 mm of rainfall per year, mainly between November and March, with a mean maximum temperature (1991-2000 average) of 27°C (Figure 6).

In both Mbire and Murehwa, the 2022/23 season (first season of experimentation, with the establishment in November) was average, but the 2023/24 season was dry compared to the long-term (1990-2000) average, with in particular an unusually dry February-March period in both District (Figures 3 and 4). Maximum temperatures were also several degrees above long-term average I both districts during that period. Due to an El Niño event, this pattern has had severe implications for the performance of the trials during the second season of investigation (see below).

Landscape description
Land slope: flat(0-2%) to gentle(3-5%) in both sites (Figures 3 and 4)
Soil texture class: sandy loam and silt loam soils, with cases of loam soils in both sites (Figures 7 and 8).
Trial setup
Ten on-farm trials were established in each site, with each trial having three non-replicated treatments during the first season of experimentation (2022/23 season) and six during the second season of experimentation (2023/24). The three treatments compared during the first season were conventional practices, conservation agriculture (with ""dead mulch""), and push-pull. Biochar, traditional practices, and conservation agriculture with live mulch were added in the second season. Performances were evaluated on productivity, rainwater use efficiency, and pest biocontrol. The plots were 6 m wide and 24 m long (Figures 11 and 12). Trials were established in mid-December 2022 and are planned to last until March 2025.

In 2023, following the completion of the first cycle of mother demonstration trials, 83 farmers — 64 in Murehwa and 19 in Mbire — within the ALLs selected a minimum of two treatments from the mother trials for adoption and adaptation in their baby fields. In Mbire, most farmers opted for conservation agriculture (with ""dead mulch""), followed by push-pull and conventional practices (Figure 9). In Murehwa, most farmers chose conventional practices, followed by push-pull and conservation agriculture (with ""dead mulch"") (Figure 9). In these baby trials, farmers adhered to the original plot size and spacing used in the mother trials but were free to modify specific practices, including tillage methods, pest control strategies (Figure 10), and soil fertility management. All field activities and management practices were documented. These baby trials were established mid-December 2023 and will last until March 2025.

Dear Editor,
Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most
widely cultivated crops worldwide (Ra- num et al., 2014), accounting for about 37.2% of the global cereal crop produc- tion. Maize production yield has increased over sevenfold since single-cross maize hybrids were deployed in the beginning of the last century (Andorf et al., 2019). To date, intensive breeding efforts have im- proved the density tolerance, yield poten- tial, disease resistance, stress tolerance, and adaptability of maize hybrids (Duvick, 2005; Luo et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2011). In the present study, we have conducted genome wide selection analysis and machine learning feasibility test in a large maize germplasm panel consisting of 2,430 modern inbred lines from diverse geographic regions with varying desirable traits. Deep neural network genomic prediction (DNNGP) (Wang et al., 2023) models were built to predict plant archi- tecture and yield-related traits using rare and favorable loci across different germ- plasms.
A diversity panel of 2,933 maize inbred lines consisted of 2,430 modern inbred lines, which were derived from commer- cial hybrids and 503 diverse inbred lines, were widely used in breeding (Table S1 in Supporting Information). These inbred lines were utilized to explore rare and favorable allelic variations across different germplasms with an ambition to under- stand the missing genetic variations in the current maize breeding population and further to design breakthrough varieties
in maize breeding. By resequencing of the entire panel, calling and filtering single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we se- lected and used 437,081 high quality SNP markers in the following analyses (Table S2 in Supporting Information). The SNP distribution plot revealed that chro- mosome (Chr) 1 (16.43%) and Chr 6 (7.27%) had the highest and the least number of SNPs, respectively (Figure 1A; Table S2 in Supporting Information). These SNPs were distributed almost in the entire genome, covered a physical distance of 2,105.41 Mb ranging from 150.94 Mb of Chr 10 to 306.96 Mb of Chr 1. The average distance between neigh- bored pair-wise SNPs across each chro- mosome varied from 4.27 kb in Chr 1 to 5.47 kb in Chr 6.
Genetic variations in the maize diversity panel were assessed by annotating SNPs with genetic location (e.g., intron or exon) and potential effects on gene function (e. g., missense). A total of 2,648,748 putative genomic variations were identi- fied between the 2,933 lines and the B73 genome assembly (Table S3 in Supporting Information). Of these variations, mis- sense and frameshift mutations accounted for 5.14% and 0.08%, respectively. The rest of the variations either located in introns/intergenic regions (85.53%) or resulted in synonymous mutations (9.26%). Downstream region of genes held the most of SNPs, followed by introns, upstream, exons, intergenic, 3′ UTR, and transcript variant regions, covering 23.57%, 18.85%, 16.64%,
the total SNPs (Table S4 in Supporting Information). Relatively, a few SNPs were distributed in the 5′UTR, splice regions, acceptor splice sites, and splice donor sites. The synonymous/non-synonymous SNPs ratio is 136,064/213,000 (i.e., 0.64), indicating adaptive selections in the panel.
Inferring the population genetic struc- ture of the panel through unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis revealed a low- diversity clustering, which contradicts previous reports (Yang et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018). Subse- quently, semi-supervised ADMIXTURE analyses produced 11 clusters denoted as K1 to K11 (Figure S1 and Table S1 in Supporting Information), with the highest number of inbred lines clustered in K2 (830) and the fewest in K9 (45). The K1 subgroup, referred to as Lvda Red Cob, contained 180 (6.14%) inbred lines in- cluding the elite ones, E28 and Lv28. The K2 (28.30%) and K3 (9.96%) were mainly derived from Monsanto and Pio- neer hybrids, which included few tradi- tional inbred lines. The K4 subgroup, referred to as X (including Jing724), was the second largest group consisting of 676 lines mainly derived from XY335 hybrid. The K5 and K6 subgroups, referred to as Lancaster (145) and BSSS (218), con- tained the male parents of Mo17 and Zi330, and female parents of B73 and B37. The K7 subgroup, referred to as P78599 (98), consisted of P138 and Qi319 disease-resistant inbred lines that were mainly derived from P78599 hybrid.

TSPT (184), were mainly derived from the Huangzaosi inbred line. The K9 and K10 subgroups, referred to as Tropical I (45) and Tropical II (211), contained tropical and sub-tropical inbred lines. The lines in the K11 cluster, referred to as Reid (54), were primarily developed from American commercial hybrids.
Principal component analysis (PCA) based on semi-supervised population structure showed that the top 10 PCs accounted for about 25% of the genomic variation, in which the first three PCs explained 5.73%, 4.00%, and 2.45% (Figure S2 in Supporting Information). Scatter plots of the top three PCs revealed a weak differentiation between sub- groups, with high overlaps among K1, K5, K6, K7, K10 and K11. In contrast, K2 and K3 were clearly differentiated from the others (Figure 1B; Figure S3 in Supporting Information). A distance- based phylogenetic analysis revealed that clustering patterns were consistent with
the PCA results (Figure 1C).
The findings of this study suggested new heterotic groups through introdu- cing novel germplasm into the panel. To evaluate their genetic relationships, pair- wise kinship coefficients and genetic dis- tances were calculated (Tables S5–S6 and Figure S4 in Supporting Information). The average relative kinship between any two lines was 0.0065, ranging from 0 to 3.52 across the panel (Table S5 in Supporting Information). Sixty-five per- cent of the relative kinship values were 0, indicating a weak genetic similarity be- tween the lines (Figure S4A in Supporting Information). The average genetic dis- tance among inbred lines was 0.03, varying from 0 to 0.37 across the panel (Table S6 in Supporting Information). We found that 87% of genetic distance comparisons among inbred lines fell between 0.10 and 0.30, suggesting a relatively large genetic distance among them. In alignment with the PCA results, the genome-wide pairwise genetic fixation index (FST) between the 11 subgroups was high, except among K1, K5, K6, K7, K10, and K11 (Figure 1D). The analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) revealed that 77.13% of the variance was ex- plained within subgroups, compared to 20.16% between subgroups, indicating a relatively rich genetic diversity within subgroups (Table S7 in Supporting In-
formation).
Genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) was examined for the 11 subgroups,
revealing a rapid decrease in LD with an
increasing physical distance (Figure 1E). K9 and K10 had the slowest LD decay, indicating that they may have a higher genetic diversity. To further investigate the genetic diversity among the 2,933 inbred lines and 11 subgroups, we con- ducted analyses of heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He), poly- morphic information content (PIC), and nucleotide diversity (Pi) using 437,081 SNPs (Table S8 and Figures S5–S7 in Supporting Information). The average of Ho was 0.01, ranging from 0 to 0.15, which was lower than that of He (0.23, ranging from 0.09 to 0.50), suggesting a potential directional selection. The aver- age PIC of subgroups K9 (0.21) and K10 (0.24) was higher than that of the whole panel (0.20, ranging from 0.09 to 0.38), which indicates a higher genetic diversity. This result is consistent with the results of Pi and LD analysis. Furthermore, the Tajima’s D values were positive (Tajima’s D>0) for the whole panel and all sub- groups, indicating a balancing selection. However, the lower average values for K2 (0.96) and K3 (1.06) implied a relatively lower selection pressure (Table S8 in Supporting Information).
Results of this study revealed that a
large proportion of genetic variation was utilized better in modern maize breeding lines. The FST, cross population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH), and Pi ratio values (Park et al., 2012) were computed in the diversified panel of maize inbred lines (Figure S8 in Supporting Information). Implementing the top 5% as a cutoff, the three methods identified 21,854 loci with a large allelic frequency difference across the germplasm (Figure 1F; Tables S9–S11 in Supporting Infor- mation). To facilitate demonstration, these loci were named as enriched loci hereafter. Among them, 827 were de- tected by all of the three methods. A total of 6,463, 2,117, and 1,146 were detected by FST and Pi ratio, FST and XP-EHH, and Pi ratio and XP-EHH, respectively. A total of 54,177 non-redundant loci, account- ing for 12.40% of all SNPs, were identified from the three analyses (Figure 1F).
The confidence intervals (CIs) for en- riched loci encompassed 27,113 genes, representing 69.5% of all maize genes (Tables S9–S11 in Supporting Informa- tion). Of the encompassed genes, 3,926 were located within the CIs of 827 enriched loci (Figure 1G). In addition, 14,470 genes were identified by both FST
and Pi ratio. Fewer overlapping genes were found between FST and XP-EHH (248) or Pi ratio and XP-EHH (314). Moreover, 605 genes with known func- tions (72.7% of total functional genes) were found in the CIs of enriched loci. GO analysis suggested the enrichment of these genes for various biological pro- cesses, including flowering time, root development, stress resistance, yield, and plant architecture building.
To verify whether machine learning models could facilitate genomic selection in plant breeding programs, we con- structed genomic selection models for eight plant architecture and yield-related traits using DNNGP algorithm with the 54,177 non-redundant enriched loci for 2,430 modern maize inbred lines. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the eight traits ranged from 0.442 to 0.636. Flowering time (FT) showed the highest predictive accuracy, while ear length (EL) had the lowest accuracy (Figure 1H; Table S12 in Supporting Information). Plant architecture traits showed a significantly higher accuracy than yield-related traits.
We conducted simulations for yield- related traits to determine the required size of the breeding populations at differ- ent selection proportions. The results reveal that the required individual fold significantly decreases with the selection proportion increases. Taking EL for ex- ample, an average of 12.25- and 28.10- time of the individual number is required to be planted in a 1% selection proportion to achieve 50% and 100% selection accuracies, respectively. By contrast, only 1.88 and 8.01 times individuals were required to achieve 50% and 100% selection accuracies under a 10% selec- tion proportion. This indicates that a much larger breeding population is re- quired to achieve 100% selection accu- racy compared to that is required to achieve 50% selection accuracy, regard- less of selection proportion (Figure 1I; Figure S9 and Table S13 in Supporting Information). Hence, selection proportion is one of the key factors in genomic selection-based breeding strategy to en- sure improved genetic gain of yield-
related traits.
This study constructed a large and diversified maize germplasm panel, repre- senting the advanced commercial germ- plasm. Two new subgroups were identified from this panel, which could potentially complement the widely used heterotic groups in maize breeding pro-

Dear Editor,
Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most
widely cultivated crops worldwide (Ra- num et al., 2014), accounting for about 37.2% of the global cereal crop produc- tion. Maize production yield has increased over sevenfold since single-cross maize hybrids were deployed in the beginning of the last century (Andorf et al., 2019). To date, intensive breeding efforts have im- proved the density tolerance, yield poten- tial, disease resistance, stress tolerance, and adaptability of maize hybrids (Duvick, 2005; Luo et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2011). In the present study, we have conducted genome wide selection analysis and machine learning feasibility test in a large maize germplasm panel consisting of 2,430 modern inbred lines from diverse geographic regions with varying desirable traits. Deep neural network genomic prediction (DNNGP) (Wang et al., 2023) models were built to predict plant archi- tecture and yield-related traits using rare and favorable loci across different germ- plasms.
A diversity panel of 2,933 maize inbred lines consisted of 2,430 modern inbred lines, which were derived from commer- cial hybrids and 503 diverse inbred lines, were widely used in breeding (Table S1 in Supporting Information). These inbred lines were utilized to explore rare and favorable allelic variations across different germplasms with an ambition to under- stand the missing genetic variations in the current maize breeding population and further to design breakthrough varieties
in maize breeding. By resequencing of the entire panel, calling and filtering single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we se- lected and used 437,081 high quality SNP markers in the following analyses (Table S2 in Supporting Information). The SNP distribution plot revealed that chro- mosome (Chr) 1 (16.43%) and Chr 6 (7.27%) had the highest and the least number of SNPs, respectively (Figure 1A; Table S2 in Supporting Information). These SNPs were distributed almost in the entire genome, covered a physical distance of 2,105.41 Mb ranging from 150.94 Mb of Chr 10 to 306.96 Mb of Chr 1. The average distance between neigh- bored pair-wise SNPs across each chro- mosome varied from 4.27 kb in Chr 1 to 5.47 kb in Chr 6.
Genetic variations in the maize diversity panel were assessed by annotating SNPs with genetic location (e.g., intron or exon) and potential effects on gene function (e. g., missense). A total of 2,648,748 putative genomic variations were identi- fied between the 2,933 lines and the B73 genome assembly (Table S3 in Supporting Information). Of these variations, mis- sense and frameshift mutations accounted for 5.14% and 0.08%, respectively. The rest of the variations either located in introns/intergenic regions (85.53%) or resulted in synonymous mutations (9.26%). Downstream region of genes held the most of SNPs, followed by introns, upstream, exons, intergenic, 3′ UTR, and transcript variant regions, covering 23.57%, 18.85%, 16.64%,
the total SNPs (Table S4 in Supporting Information). Relatively, a few SNPs were distributed in the 5′UTR, splice regions, acceptor splice sites, and splice donor sites. The synonymous/non-synonymous SNPs ratio is 136,064/213,000 (i.e., 0.64), indicating adaptive selections in the panel.
Inferring the population genetic struc- ture of the panel through unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis revealed a low- diversity clustering, which contradicts previous reports (Yang et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018). Subse- quently, semi-supervised ADMIXTURE analyses produced 11 clusters denoted as K1 to K11 (Figure S1 and Table S1 in Supporting Information), with the highest number of inbred lines clustered in K2 (830) and the fewest in K9 (45). The K1 subgroup, referred to as Lvda Red Cob, contained 180 (6.14%) inbred lines in- cluding the elite ones, E28 and Lv28. The K2 (28.30%) and K3 (9.96%) were mainly derived from Monsanto and Pio- neer hybrids, which included few tradi- tional inbred lines.

TSPT (184), were mainly derived from the Huangzaosi inbred line. The K9 and K10 subgroups, referred to as Tropical I (45) and Tropical II (211), contained tropical and sub-tropical inbred lines. The lines in the K11 cluster, referred to as Reid (54), were primarily developed from American commercial hybrids.
Principal component analysis (PCA) based on semi-supervised population structure showed that the top 10 PCs accounted for about 25% of the genomic variation, in which the first three PCs explained 5.73%, 4.00%, and 2.45% (Figure S2 in Supporting Information). Scatter plots of the top three PCs revealed a weak differentiation between sub- groups, with high overlaps among K1, K5, K6, K7, K10 and K11. In contrast, K2 and K3 were clearly differentiated from the others (Figure 1B; Figure S3 in Supporting Information). A distance- based phylogenetic analysis revealed that clustering patterns were consistent with
the PCA results (Figure 1C).
The findings of this study suggested new heterotic groups through introdu- cing novel germplasm into the panel. To evaluate their genetic relationships, pair- wise kinship coefficients and genetic dis- tances were calculated (Tables S5–S6 and Figure S4 in Supporting Information). The average relative kinship between any two lines was 0.0065, ranging from 0 to 3.52 across the panel (Table S5 in Supporting Information). Sixty-five per- cent of the relative kinship values were 0, indicating a weak genetic similarity be- tween the lines (Figure S4A in Supporting Information). The average genetic dis- tance among inbred lines was 0.03, varying from 0 to 0.37 across the panel (Table S6 in Supporting Information). We found that 87% of genetic distance comparisons among inbred lines fell between 0.10 and 0.30, suggesting a relatively large genetic distance among them. In alignment with the PCA results, the genome-wide pairwise genetic fixation index (FST) between the 11 subgroups was high, except among K1, K5, K6, K7, K10, and K11 (Figure 1D). The analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) revealed that 77.13% of the variance was ex- plained within subgroups, compared to 20.16% between subgroups, indicating a relatively rich genetic diversity within subgroups (Table S7 in Supporting In-
formation).
Genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) was examined for the 11 subgroups,
revealing a rapid decrease in LD with an
increasing physical distance (Figure 1E). K9 and K10 had the slowest LD decay, indicating that they may have a higher genetic diversity. To further investigate the genetic diversity among the 2,933 inbred lines and 11 subgroups, we con- ducted analyses of heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He), poly- morphic information content (PIC), and nucleotide diversity (Pi) using 437,081 SNPs (Table S8 and Figures S5–S7 in Supporting Information). The average of Ho was 0.01, ranging from 0 to 0.15, which was lower than that of He (0.23, ranging from 0.09 to 0.50), suggesting a potential directional selection. The aver- age PIC of subgroups K9 (0.21) and K10 (0.24) was higher than that of the whole panel (0.20, ranging from 0.09 to 0.38), which indicates a higher genetic diversity. This result is consistent with the results of Pi and LD analysis. Furthermore, the Tajima’s D values were positive (Tajima’s D>0) for the whole panel and all sub- groups, indicating a balancing selection. However, the lower average values for K2 (0.96) and K3 (1.06) implied a relatively lower selection pressure (Table S8 in Supporting Information).
Results of this study revealed that a
large proportion of genetic variation was utilized better in modern maize breeding lines. The FST, cross population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH), and Pi ratio values (Park et al., 2012) were computed in the diversified panel of maize inbred lines (Figure S8 in Supporting Information). Implementing the top 5% as a cutoff, the three methods identified 21,854 loci with a large allelic frequency difference across the germplasm (Figure 1F; Tables S9–S11 in Supporting Infor- mation). To facilitate demonstration, these loci were named as enriched loci hereafter. Among them, 827 were de- tected by all of the three methods. A total of 6,463, 2,117, and 1,146 were detected by FST and Pi ratio, FST and XP-EHH, and Pi ratio and XP-EHH, respectively. A total of 54,177 non-redundant loci, account- ing for 12.40% of all SNPs, were identified from the three analyses (Figure 1F).
The confidence intervals (CIs) for en- riched loci encompassed 27,113 genes, representing 69.5% of all maize genes (Tables S9–S11 in Supporting Informa- tion). Of the encompassed genes, 3,926 were located within the CIs of 827 enriched loci (Figure 1G). In addition, 14,470 genes were identified by both FST
and Pi ratio. Fewer overlapping genes were found between FST and XP-EHH (248) or Pi ratio and XP-EHH (314). Moreover, 605 genes with known func- tions (72.7% of total functional genes) were found in the CIs of enriched loci. GO analysis suggested the enrichment of these genes for various biological pro- cesses, including flowering time, root development, stress resistance, yield, and plant architecture building.
To verify whether machine learning models could facilitate genomic selection in plant breeding programs, we con- structed genomic selection models for eight plant architecture and yield-related traits using DNNGP algorithm with the 54,177 non-redundant enriched loci for 2,430 modern maize inbred lines. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the eight traits ranged from 0.442 to 0.636. Flowering time (FT) showed the highest predictive accuracy, while ear length (EL) had the lowest accuracy (Figure 1H; Table S12 in Supporting Information). Plant architecture traits showed a significantly higher accuracy than yield-related traits.
We conducted simulations for yield- related traits to determine the required size of the breeding populations at differ- ent selection proportions. The results reveal that the required individual fold significantly decreases with the selection proportion increases. Taking EL for ex- ample, an average of 12.25- and 28.10- time of the individual number is required to be planted in a 1% selection proportion to achieve 50% and 100% selection accuracies, respectively. By contrast, only 1.88 and 8.01 times individuals were required to achieve 50% and 100% selection accuracies under a 10% selec- tion proportion. This indicates that a much larger breeding population is re- quired to achieve 100% selection accu- racy compared to that is required to achieve 50% selection accuracy, regard- less of selection proportion (Figure 1I; Figure S9 and Table S13 in Supporting Information). Hence, selection proportion is one of the key factors in genomic selection-based breeding strategy to en- sure improved genetic gain of yield-
related traits.
This study constructed a large and diversified maize germplasm panel, repre- senting the advanced commercial germ- plasm. Two new subgroups were identified from this panel, which could potentially complement the widely used heterotic groups in maize breeding pro-

A CGIAR anmanivt on Agroecology
Component 1 - Trial Description
Section 1.1- Codesign process
i. Participants
In Kenya, the CGIAR Agroecology Initiative (AE-I) has two agroecological living landscapes (ALLs), one in Kiambu County and another in Makueni County. The Initiative’s interaction and engagement with the ALLs is organized via central points referred to as ‘ALLs host centers’: the Community Sustainable Agriculture and Healthy Environment Program (CSHEP) in Ndeiya, Kiambu County, which focuses on organic agriculture; and the Drylands Natural Resource Centre (DNRC) in Mbumbuni, Makueni County, focusing on permaculture. The ALLs host centers represent and provide a physical space where food system actors can meet, interact, and co-create knowledge.
The innovation co-design workshops that led to the identiﬁcation of innovative practices for on-farm experimentation were embedded in a broader engagement and co-creation process that involved diverse stakeholders. The initial co-design workshops that led to the ﬁrst cycle of on-farm experimentation involved about 45 persons per ALL. Stakeholders included farmers, ALL host centers, the AE-I team, and additional research, technical, and extension stakeholders, including from Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), County Agricultural Extension Department and Participatory Ecological Land Use Management (PELUM) Association (Figure 1). The leads of both ALL host centers participated in the co-design workshops in both ALLs (registered as “farmer training center”), as did the zonal manager of PELUM-Kenya, registered as “NGO”), one of the AE-I Kenya’s key scaling partners.

Farmers were purposively selected from a total of 15 farmer groups per ALL, half of which had previously been trained by the ALL host centers, and half had not. The identiﬁed farmer groups were invited to observe gender and age balance in their selection of representatives who would participate in the workshop.

ob on Agroecology CGIAR
In view of the practices and test crops selected, and the agricultural cycles in the Kenyan ALLs, two consecutive rounds of co-design workshops were held in April 2024, and October 2024 respectively. These led to the establishment of a second and third cycle of trials.

The three phases included several distinct activities, including workshops at different levels and research activities (Table 1). These co-design focused activities were complemented by other activities implemented by the AE-I that did not speciﬁcally focus on the co-design of innovative agroecological options.

iii. Outcomes and Challenges
The Kenya team proceeded in a highly methodical manner in its co-design process. The main challenges identiﬁed in the initial stages of engagement (Table 2) already established core areas of interest for agroecological innovation. These echoed aspects highlighted in the center characterization, and were further developed in the vision-to-action plans.

Key was the identiﬁcation of three focus areas in which there was considerable interest for innovative agroecological on-farm practices: soil management, water management, and integrated pest management. The subsequent innovation assessment, carried out as part of the preparatory phase (Kuria et al. 2023) inventoried 27 unique practices in both ALLs, 26 in Kiambu and 13 in Makueni (see Figure 1).

Building on the functional distinction introduced by the ALL stakeholders, the preference assessment carried out in the same vein revealed key preferred practices for each focus area – but also highlighted the multifunctional nature of many of the practices (Figure 5).

During the co-design workshops, context-speciﬁc priorities emerging from the prioritization assessment were presented to participants. Participants, on the other hand, presented their preferences. Ultimately, three practices per focus areas were selected collectively for each ALL (Table 3).

After identifying the innovative practices, the test crops and overall experimental design were co-designed as well. This led to the identiﬁcation of six practices (Table 4). Importantly, farmers decided to use their conventional practice on the control plots.

Challenges encountered during the establishment and life cycle of the ﬁrst phase of trials included various aspects. In Makueni, these included:
• Late initial planting;
• Identiﬁed local bean variety seems to have had two types, one of which was a climbing bean that strangled the maize;
• Manure had cutworms, which needed to be managed;
Initial manure application rate was too low, affecting yields;

• Napier grass planted on terraces affected growth of neighboring crops;
• Spraying of neem concoction led to scorching of maize leaves.
In Kiambu, challenges included:
• Late initial planting;
• Torrential rains and ﬂoods in Kiambu county (as in many parts of the country), leading to parts of the trials being swept away;
• Heavy rain led to blight;
• Compost had cutworms, which affected spinach, leading to the need for gapping;
• Mulch contributed to water logging, leading to stunted growth and root rot;
• Preparation of chili concoction was discomforting;
• Spraying of chili concoction did not manage all pests, only some;
• Market challenges.
Section 1.2- Description of practices
During co-design, it was decided that the experimental set-up would include two 5 m by 6 m plots located next to each other. Each practice was established by about 10 farmers, and all three practices per ALL were established at the respective ALL host center.

Component 1 - Trial Description
Section 1.1- Codesign process
i. Participants
In Kenya, the CGIAR Agroecology Initiative (AE-I) has two agroecological living landscapes (ALLs), one in Kiambu County and another in Makueni County. The Initiative’s interaction and engagement with the ALLs is organized via central points referred to as ‘ALLs host centers’: the Community Sustainable Agriculture and Healthy Environment Program (CSHEP) in Ndeiya, Kiambu County, which focuses on organic agriculture; and the Drylands Natural Resource Centre (DNRC) in Mbumbuni, Makueni County, focusing on permaculture. The ALLs host centers represent and provide a physical space where food system actors can meet, interact, and co-create knowledge.
The innovation co-design workshops that led to the identiﬁcation of innovative practices for on-farm experimentation were embedded in a broader engagement and co-creation process that involved diverse stakeholders. The initial co-design workshops that led to the ﬁrst cycle of on-farm experimentation involved about 45 persons per ALL. Stakeholders included farmers, ALL host centers, the AE-I team, and additional research, technical, and extension stakeholders, including from Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), County Agricultural Extension Department and Participatory Ecological Land Use Management (PELUM) Association (Figure 1). The leads of both ALL host centers participated in the co-design workshops in both ALLs (registered as “farmer training center”), as did the zonal manager of PELUM-Kenya, registered as “NGO”), one of the AE-I Kenya’s key scaling partners.

Farmers were purposively selected from a total of 15 farmer groups per ALL, half of which had previously been trained by the ALL host centers, and half had not. The identiﬁed farmer groups were invited to observe gender and age balance in their selection of representatives who would participate in the workshop.

In view of the practices and test crops selected, and the agricultural cycles in the Kenyan ALLs, two consecutive rounds of co-design workshops were held in April 2024, and October 2024 respectively. These led to the establishment of a second and third cycle of trials.
ii. Workshops and Activities
The broader co-design process involved three distinct but inter-related phases: (1) preparation, (2) co-design workshops, (3) trials (Figure 2).

The three phases included several distinct activities, including workshops at different levels and research activities (Table 1). These co-design focused activities were complemented by other activities implemented by the AE-I that did not speciﬁcally focus on the co-design of innovative agroecological options.

iii. Outcomes and Challenges
The Kenya team proceeded in a highly methodical manner in its co-design process. The main challenges identiﬁed in the initial stages of engagement (Table 2) already established core areas of interest for agroecological innovation. These echoed aspects highlighted in the center characterization, and were further developed in the vision-to-action plans.

Key was the identiﬁcation of three focus areas in which there was considerable interest for innovative agroecological on-farm practices: soil management, water management, and integrated pest management. The subsequent innovation assessment, carried out as part of the preparatory phase (Kuria et al. 2023) inventoried 27 unique practices in both ALLs, 26 in Kiambu and 13 in Makueni (see Figure 1).

After identifying the innovative practices, the test crops and overall experimental design were co-designed as well. This led to the identiﬁcation of six practices (Table 4). Importantly, farmers decided to use their conventional practice on the control plots.

Challenges encountered during the establishment and life cycle of the ﬁrst phase of trials included various aspects. In Makueni, these included:
• Late initial planting;
• Identiﬁed local bean variety seems to have had two types, one of which was a climbing bean that strangled the maize;
• Manure had cutworms, which needed to be managed;
Initial manure application rate was too low, affecting yields;

• Napier grass planted on terraces affected growth of neighboring crops;
• Spraying of neem concoction led to scorching of maize leaves.
In Kiambu, challenges included:
• Late initial planting;
• Torrential rains and ﬂoods in Kiambu county (as in many parts of the country), leading to parts of the trials being swept away;
• Heavy rain led to blight;
• Compost had cutworms, which affected spinach, leading to the need for gapping;
• Mulch contributed to water logging, leading to stunted growth and root rot;
• Preparation of chili concoction was discomforting;
• Spraying of chili concoction did not manage all pests, only some;
• Market challenges.
Section 1.2- Description of practices
During co-design, it was decided that the experimental set-up would include two 5 m by 6 m plots located next to each other. Each practice was established by about 10 farmers, and all three practices per ALL were established at the respective ALL host center.
Table 5 lists the details for each of the six practices. While the practices themselves were kept constant across the ﬁrst and second cycle of t"

Resumen ejecutivo
La Iniciativa Agroecología se desarrolló en la Región Ucayali, en la amazonia peruana. Su trabajo se focalizó en la cadena de valor del cacao, trabajando directamente con dos cooperativas de productores: Colpa de Loros y Banaqui Curimaná. Se apoyó a ambas cooperativas desde la evaluación agroecológica de su modelo de negocio y se acompañó en el proceso de diseño e implementación de prácticas agroecológicas. El presente Reporte Técnico describe el caso de la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros.
La Cooperativa Colpa de Loros es una organización de productores cacaoteros ubicada en el distrito de Neshuya, provincia de Padre Abad. Desde su constitución, el año 2015, tuvo una relación muy profunda con la empresa chocolatera francesa Kaoka, su principal cliente. El interés de Kaoka por el cacao fino de aroma que cultivan (parcialmente) los socios de Colpa de Loros, ha llevado a esta empresa fortalecer una relación estratégica con Colpa de Loros (práctica que desarrolla con otros socios proveedores en otros países), contribuyendo con diferentes iniciativas ambientales y sociales de la organización, con aportes propios o intermediando fondos de cooperación, como por ejemplo fondos del Fondo Francés para el Medio Ambiente Mundial – FFEM.
Una restricción para la producción orgánica de cacao de los productores socios de Colpa de Loros, es el acceso a fertilizantes orgánicos. El guano de isla, es un bien escaso, inaccesible para una significativa parte de los socios de Colpa de Loros; si bien la cooperativa cuenta con una planta de producción de compost orgánico, la misma sólo trabaja al 35% de su capacidad instalada, por limitaciones en el acceso a residuos provenientes de la producción agrícola, que deben generados por procesos orgánicos.
En este escenario, confluyó la idea de los socios, de producir arroz y caña de azúcar en forma orgánica, con el interés societario de poder incrementar la producción de compost y optimizar el uso de la planta procesadora, utilizando los residuos orgánicos de la producción de arroz y panela. La idea se incorporó a los lineamientos de trabajo de la organización. Algunos socios de la cooperativa producen a la fecha arroz orgánico, con el objetivo de consumir un alimento inocuo. Asimismo, existen en la zona, empresas medianas que producen caña de azúcar e iniciativas públicas que promueven el cultivo. Ambos productos (arroz y azúcar, que sería reemplazada por panela orgánica) son elementos esenciales de la dieta del poblador peruano; se propone reemplazar el consumo de arroz y azúcar convencionales, producidos con un alto volumen de agroquímicos, con arroz y panela orgánicos. La producción de arroz orgánico sería absorbida por el consumo de los productores, su entorno y la población de la localidad. La producción de panela, por los volúmenes que se producirían, requerirían ser canalizados a un mercado mayor, Pucallpa, Lima o el mercado de exportación.
El proyecto arroz orgánico contempla la instalación de 100Has de arroz, en los sectores de “El Triunfo” y “El Milagro”; la planta de pilado se instalaría en la sede principal de la Cooperativa, en el distrito de Neshuya. La producción de arroz se realizaría a secano, con una sola campaña anual. El costo de instalación de una Ha de arroz en secano se ha estimado en US$ 1,949 por Ha; para una inversión total de US$ 194,900 por campaña agrícola, inversión que sería cubierta por los socios que participen del proyecto (se espera obtener contrapartidas que apoyen a los productores). La inversión total en la planta piladora de arroz es de US$ 197,701, se espera que la Cooperativa pueda acceder a fondos de cooperación o concursables del gobierno peruano que apalanquen los recursos propios de la organización. La evaluación económica del proyecto, en un horizonte de cinco años ha determinado su viabilidad económica con un VAN económico de US$ 35,849, una TIR económica de 20.8% y una ratio de beneficio/costo de 1.04.
El proyecto caña de azúcar orgánica para panela contempla la instalación de 100Has de caña de azúcar, en los sectores de “Nolberth de Alto Uruya”, “Virgen del Carmen” y “Cadena Tropical”. La planta para la producción de panela se instalaría en centro poblado de Virgen del Carmen, que tiene una ubicación estratégica, central en la zona de producción y cuenta con las condiciones necesarias para la producción industrial. La Cooperativa Colpa de Loros ha adquirido el terreno donde se instalaría la planta industrial. La producción de caña de azúcar se realizaría a secano. El costo de instalación de una Ha de caña de azúcar en secano se ha estimado en US$ 4,444 por Ha; para una inversión total de US$ 444,400 por campaña agrícola. Los costos de mantenimiento de las cañas socas, oscilan alrededor de los US$ 2,000 anuales. La inversión en fincas sería cubierta por los socios que participen del proyecto (igualmente, se espera obtener contrapartidas que apoyen a los productores). La inversión total en la planta procesadora de panela es de US$ 482,449, al igual que en el proyecto de arroz, se espera que la Cooperativa pueda acceder a fondos de cooperación o concursables del gobierno peruano que apalanquen los recursos propios de la organización. La evaluación económica del proyecto, en un horizonte de cinco años ha determinado su viabilidad económica con un VAN económico de US$ 58,402, una TIR económica de 20.8% y una ratio de beneficio/costo de 1.03.

Ambos proyectos contribuirán con materia orgánica para la producción de abonos orgánicos. En el caso del arroz, son tres los residuos: cascarilla, polvillo y ñelen – arrocillo, con una producción total de los tres subproductos de 86.7TM a partir del segundo año. La producción de panela orgánica igualmente dejará tres residuos orgánicos: bagazo, cachaza y melaza; con una producción variable en el período de análisis, con una producción máxima de 1,305 TM conjuntas el primer año de producción.
Contexto
La Iniciativa de Agroecología del CGIAR, tiene como objetivo “desarrollar y ampliar innovaciones agroecológicas con pequeños agricultores y otros actores del sistema agrícola y alimentario, en diferentes contextos socioecológicos, en ocho países de ingresos bajos y medios”. La Iniciativa se desarrolló en Burkina Faso, India, Kenya, Laos, Perú, Senegal, Tunisia y Zimbabwe. En el caso del Perú, la iniciativa se implementó en la Región Ucayali, en la amazonia peruana. El trabajo en el caso peruano estuvo focalizado en la cadena de valor del cacao, uno de los principales cultivos basados en agricultura familiar de la región y del país. La iniciativa se implementó mediante cinco paquetes de trabajo, para atender todos los aspectos vinculados a la gestión agroecológica, los aspectos técnicos productivos, los de gobernanza, los financieros, las interrelaciones con el sector público y las políticas públicas, y los aspectos de mercado. Los cinco paquetes de trabajo desarrollaron sus actividades en forma interrelacionada, con la finalidad que “Los actores del sistema alimentario apliquen los principios agroecológicos adaptados a un contexto particular, desde la producción de alimentos hasta el consumo”. El paquete de trabajo 3 de la iniciativa, se desarrolló con el objeto de facilitar la implementación de “Modelos de negocio inclusivos con enfoque en principios agroecológicos”. En Perú se trabajó con las Cooperativa Colpa de Loros y Banaqui Curimaná. Se presenta a continuación el trabajo realizado en la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros.
La primera actividad desarrollada con la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros, fue el diagnóstico de situación, con un análisis transversal de la operación desde la perspectiva agroecológica. Desde los resultados del análisis se definieron y acordaron oportunidades de fortalecimiento para apoyar a la cooperativa en su transición agroecológica. Finalmente, empleando los recursos y las capacidades técnicas aportados por la Incubadora - Aceleradora de la Iniciativa de Agroecología, se formularon dos planes de negocio que responden a las necesidades y prioridades de la cooperativa buscan contribuir a su desempeño en varios principios agroecológicos.
La Cooperativa Colpa de Loros
La Cooperativa Agraria de Cacao Aromático Colpa de Loros, identificada con Registro Único de Contribuyente - RUC Nro 20600390911, se encuentra ubicada en el Centro Poblado El Triunfo, Km 66 de la Carretera Federico Basadre, distrito de Neshuya, provincia de Padre Abad, región Ucayali. La cooperativa fue creada en mayo del año 2015, estando debidamente constituida tanto en los Registros Públicos como en la Administración Tributaria del país (Sunat). Su gerente general, señor Ernesto Parra fue el facilitador – promotor de su constitución y es actualmente el representante legal de la organización. La Cooperativa se encuentra estratégicamente ubicada dentro del corredor agroforestal/ecológico de Ucayali. Además de su sede principal, cuenta con centros de acopio y procesamiento en Norbert del Alto Uruya, Virgen del Carmen y Ascensión de Aguaytillo.
La Misión de Colpa de Loros es “Somos una organización de agricultura orgánica comprometida con la salud, nutrición y el desarrollo sostenible a través de una alianza con socios fortalecidos con valores cooperativos”; su Visión es “En 2029, Ser una cooperativa líder y referente internacional en agricultura orgánica, alimentos saludables y la conservación ambiental de la mano con socios integralmente sostenibles”. Tomando como punto de partida las definiciones de su Misión y Visión, Colpa de Loros es una organización alineada con la producción ambiental y socialmente responsable, con una propuesta de valor que incorpora la producción sostenible. Desde su constitución, hasta la fecha, la cooperativa solamente ha trabajado en la cadena de valor del cacao, con énfasis en el cacao aromático. Este es preferido por diversas empresas chocolateras gracias a sus atributos de calidad y sabores diferenciados. Considerando de forma transversal los aspectos ambientales, Colpa de Loros busca ser una organización cooperativa generadora de beneficios económicos y sociales para sus asociados y la comunidad, mediante la producción y exportación directa rentable, sostenible y competitiva de cacao fino de aroma, aplicando las mejores prácticas agrícolas, sociales, ambientales y de gestión acordes con las tendencias del mercado.
Colpa de Loros opera bajo el modelo cooperativo. En tal sentido, cuanta con dos estamentos: el directivo y el ejecutivo. A nivel directivo, la máxima instancia es el Consejo de Administración. La organización, en concordancia con el modelo cooperativo, cuenta también con un Consejo de Vigilancia (órgano de control) y los comités de educación y electoral. Todos los miembros de los Consejos y Comités son elegidos en la Asamblea General de Socios y se renuevan de acuerdo con el mandato de la legislación peruana. El principal responsable ejecutivo es el gerente general. La estructura de la cooperativa es simple, con tres

cacao: caso de inversión - Cooperativa Colpa de Loros
4
áreas funcionales: i) asistencia técnica y certificaciones, de cara a la relación con los productores, ii) administración (finanzas, logística y comercialización) y iii) producción (específicamente de cacao y de abonos orgánicos).
Al cierre del año 2024, Colpa de Loros estaba conformada por 451 socios (aunque el número varia permanentemente por entrada y salida de socios), todos ellos productores de cacao. A la fecha de corte, la cooperativa contaba con 132 socias mujeres (29.3% del total) y 319 varones (70.3%). El consejo de administración, máximo órgano funcional de la organización está liderado por la Sra. Irene Chamaya, socia de la base Virgen del Carmen.
La cooperativa cuenta con 3 certificaciones: orgánica (USDA), Rainforest Alliance y Fair For Life (comercio justo). Cada explotación agrícola de los socios tiene un área promedio de 4.71 ha con cultivo de cacao, que con una productividad de 854.4 kg/ha. La cooperativa cuenta, en total con un área certificada como orgánica de 1,672Has (de las cuales 774Has son de cacao aromático). Las ventas son principalmente de exportación (a la empresa Kaoka, su socio comercial), pero también realizan ventas locales.
El trabajo de Colpa de Loros permite que pequeños productores cacaoteros tengan una propuesta de producción orgánica, ambientalmente sostenible, contribuyendo a la preservación de los suelos y del ecosistema en general. Además, han incorporado los lineamientos de trabajo de la producción libre de deforestación, de la masificación de los sistemas agroforestales en cacao y, complementariamente, la implementación de acuerdos privados de preservación. Todo ello con un enfoque de valor agregado, orientado a la producción de cacaos finos de aroma, con articulación directa con la empresa chocolatera Kaoka, que es el comprador final de la mayor parte de su producción. Como cooperativa tiene dos servicios sociales para sus socios: un sistema de créditos escolares, que adelanta recursos para la atención de las compras de útiles escolares y un fondo de apoyo social, para apoyar a socios y colaboradores en emergencias médicas o de fallecimiento.
Análisis del modelo de negocio
Durante el trabajo de análisis y diagnóstico de la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros, se aplicaron tres instrumentos para la recolección, sistematización y análisis de la información. En primer lugar, se empleó el Lienzo de Modelo de Negocios, incluyendo una discusión de como los principios agroecológicos se integraban en el modelo de negocio y propuesta de valor de la cooperativa. El segundo instrumento que se utilizó fue el Análisis FODA, una herramienta tradicional de la evaluación organizacional. El tercer instrumento fue la herramienta del B-ACT, construida específicamente para la toma de información de la organización, para cada uno de los 13 principios de la agroecología; sus prácticas, principios, objetivos, alcance y, desde las mismas, evaluar la profundidad del trabajo agroecológico a la fecha del análisis y las oportunidades mejora futura.
Lienzo del modelo de negocio agroecológico
Junto al equipo técnico y directivo de Colpa de Loros se analizaron los nueve componentes del Lienzo de Modelo de Negocios de la Cooperativa. Se presenta a continuación el resumen de los resultados obtenidos durante el trabajo de diagnóstico participativo llevado a cabo.
1. Clientes
Kaoka SAS, empresa chocolatera familiar francesa, es el socio comercial exclusivo de la cooperativa en Europa. Las primas de comercio justo que Kaoka otorga a la Cooperativa, junto con la financiación del FFEM (Fondo Francés para el Medio Ambiente Mundial), permiten que Biocacao, una ONG local, socio estratégico de Colpa de Loros, ejecute proyectos que restauran suelos degradados, promueven el cultivo de cacao aromático en sistemas agroforestales, firman acuerdos individuales y/o colectivos de conservación y administran sistemas de seguimiento de la deforestación. Kaoka también asume el costo de certificar a los miembros de Colpa de Loros en agricultura orgánica, esquema que cubre toda su finca y no sólo su producción de cacao. Colpa de Loros planea actualmente diversificar su portafolio de productos, agregando valor a sus residuos y subproductos de la producción de cacao (por ejemplo, trocitos y destilado de cacao).
2. Propuesta de valor
Se construyó la propuesta de valor de la cooperativa en dos frentes, de cara a los productores (su base social) y de cara a su principal cliente (Kaoka), que es aliado estratégico de su desarrollo institucional.
Hacia los productores: uno de los principales elementos en su propuesta de valor a sus socios es la oferta de precios competitivos, situados por encima de un mínimo garantizado y superior al recibido por otros productores de cacao de la región.

La cooperativa también ofrece acceso a crédito (o financiación) para cubrir costos de cosecha y compra de fertilizantes y equipos que suministra/vende a sus productores; y asistencia técnica y capacitaciones sobre diversos temas, que incluyen prácticas de producción sostenible, transición a la certificación orgánica, huertas caseras y diversificación nutricional. Finalmente, la cooperativa apoya a sus socios brindándoles créditos educativos y apoyo financiero en casos de accidentes, emergencias médicas, maternidad y entierros.
Para los clientes: Colpa de Loros garantiza a Kaoka SAS (su socio comercial exclusivo en Europa) el suministro de cacao fino de aroma, certificado por terceros correspondientes a organizaciones independientes de agricultura orgánica (con el sello Agriculture Biologique del Ministerio de Agricultura francés) y de producción y comercio socialmente responsables i.e., con los sellos de Fair Trade y Fair for Life). La cooperativa y sus productores seleccionan conjuntamente con Kaoka las variedades de cacao en función de las necesidades del fabricante de chocolate y del perfil de sus clientes. El procesamiento y la clasificación centralizados del cacao tras la cosecha (beneficiado) contribuyen además a garantizar un producto consistente de alta calidad.
3. Canales
Igualmente, se definieron los dos canales de la cooperativa, de cara a su red de abastecimiento y de cara a su cliente final.
Productores: Colpa de Loros cuenta actualmente con cuatro puntos de acopio, donde los productores asociados llevan sus cosechas de cacao. Estos puntos están distribuidos de tal manera que reducen las distancias de transporte para la mayoría de los productores.
Clientes: La cooperativa tiene con Kaoka un acuerdo de precio de exportación de cacao FOB (libre a bordo), en virtud del cual el fabricante de chocolate se hace cargo de los costos de transporte y seguros desde el puerto de salida.
4. Relaciones
Igualmente, redactadas en los dos extremos de su actividad comercial.
Productores: La cooperativa se comunica con sus socios productores a través de canales fluidos, que incluyen medios sociales como WhatsApp y Facebook. También organiza reuniones descentralizadas, que se priorizan según las distintas necesidades zonales de los productores y que se aprovechan para visitar las distintas regiones productoras. La cooperativa cuenta además con su propio programa de radio a través del cual emite comunicados e información que abarca una amplia variedad de temas.
Clientes: Colpa de Loros utiliza el teléfono, WhatsApp (entre otras redes sociales), Skype y correos electrónicos para mantener su comunicación con Kaoka, que además realiza cuatro visitas anuales a la cooperativa.
5. Fuentes de ingresos
La cooperativa acopia el cacao producido por sus socios, pagando por el mismo un precio superior al del mercado convencional. En el momento de la visita (año 2023), CdL pagaba 9,3 Soles/kg de cacao orgánico fino de aroma, respecto al pago por el cacao convencional de 7 Soles/kg, que realizaban otras cooperativas y acopiadores en la zona. La Cooperativa transfiere a sus socios el precio que obtiene por la venta, descontando los costos operativos y administrativos. Colpa de Loros, de cara a la venta, además del precio básico de mercado, que se negocia en las bolsas de Nueva York y Londres (precio que osciló entre los 2,600USD/ton y los 4,300 USD/ton durante el año 2023), recibe tres premios sobre el precio: USD 300 por tener el sello orgánico, más USD 240 por el sello de comercio justo y una prima de alta calidad de USD 160 por tonelada1.
Se presenta a continuación el valor total de las exportaciones de la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros. Cabe destacar que el incremento sustancial en las ventas del año 2024 se debe en gran parte al incremento del precio internacional, cuyo valor ha alcanzado casi un 200% de incremento en comparación con los años anteriores.
1 Durante el año 2024, el precio del cacao se incrementó hasta los US$ 12,000 por TM; el mayor precio histórico, por encima de cualquier escenario proyectado previo. Este nuevo escenario redujo el impacto positivo de los premios de precio que ofrece Colpa de Loros, que perdieron significancia respecto al valor total de venta de grano.

6. Recursos Clave
Los principales recursos con los que cuenta Colpa de Loros para sus operaciones son: i) planta de propagación clonal y viveros; ii) planta de compostaje; iii) puntos de acopio de cosechas; iv) planta centralizada de beneficiado de cacao; v) capital de trabajo; vi) crédito del programa ""Reactiva Perú""; vii) recursos financieros obtenidos a través de financiación competitiva; viii) certificaciones de agricultura orgánica, FT y FFL; ix) vehículos; x) 10 técnicos agrónomos; xi) 60 funcionarios de campo; y xii) 10 funcionarios administrativos.
7. Actividades principales
Las principales actividades de la cooperativa consisten en acopiar, procesar y comercializar cacao ecológico. Colpa de Loros proporciona formación y asistencia técnica además de los servicios y beneficios cooperativos que ofrece a sus miembros. También realiza actividades de divulgación dirigidas a posibles nuevos productores miembros. La ampliación de la capacidad de compostaje de la cooperativa puede generar suficiente fertilizante orgánico para involucrar a más productores en actividades de conservación/restauración, considerando que puede servir como moneda de cambio para incentivarlos, por ejemplo, hacia compromisos de deforestación cero.
8. Socios principales
Los principales socios de Colpa de Loros son los siguientes, junto con los bienes y servicios que proporcionan:
a) Los 451 socios de Colpa de Loros producen el cacao ecológico fino de aroma que la cooperativa consolida, procesa y comercializa. Colpa de Loros considera que el número actual de miembros limita la capacidad de la cooperativa para suministrar cacao orgánico de alta calidad de manera constante y, por lo tanto, están tratando de ampliar su membresía a un máximo de 1,000 productores.
b) Kaoka, que además de ser el socio comercial exclusivo de la cooperativa, cubre los gastos de certificación, financia los costos de la mano de obra que se dedica al control de calidad, cofinancia sus actividades de consolidación a un tipo de interés del 0% anual.
c) Agrobanco, una institución financiera de desarrollo.
d) Instituciones públicas como AGRO RURAL (Programa de Desarrollo Productivo Agrario Rural del Ministerio de Agricultura y Riego de Perú), INIA (Instituto Nacional de Innovación Agraria de Perú), SERFOR (Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre de Perú), que desarrolla el sistema de gestión de zonificación forestal y financia planes de reforestación y la implementación de sistemas agroforestales de cacao y el Servicio Nacional de Seguridad Agraria (SENASA).
e) Certificadoras como Ecocert y Flocert.
f) Otros aliados como: Cáritas Perú; Stein; La Alianza Bioversity-CIAT; ICRAF; El Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD) implementó el proyecto ""Paisajes Productivos Sostenibles en la Amazonía Peruana"".
La inestabilidad política amenaza la relación de Colpa de Loros con socios clave, especialmente los relacionados con el sector público.

Resultados de la herramienta de criterios empresariales Agroecológicos (B-ACT)
Se analizó el desempeño de la Cooperativa para cada uno de los trece principios de la agroecología, con una valoración final dada por la herramienta del B-ACT.
Se presenta un breve resumen del desempeño de Colpa de Loros para cada uno de los trece principios agroecológicos:
1. Reciclaje: La principal actividad en este componente es la producción de compost y otros fertilizantes orgánicos en la planta de compostaje de la cooperativa.
2. Reducción de insumos: La cooperativa recoge agua de lluvia en sus propias instalaciones, utiliza paneles solares para alimentar la iluminación de sus instalaciones y produce caldo bordelés y aceites hortícolas para el control de plagas y enfermedades de las plantas. Colpa de Loros también promueve y capacita a sus miembros en recolección de aguas lluvias, agricultura ecológica, producción de caldo bordelés y aceites hortícolas y control biológico de plagas.

3. Salud del suelo: Como fuente de nitrógeno orgánico, se promueve la aplicación de guano y estiércol. Además, se fomenta la inoculación de microorganismos de montaña.
4. Sanidad animal: Colpa de Loros ofrece asistencia a sus productores asociados en lo que concierne al almacenamiento y uso adecuado de los productos veterinarios que aplican a las especies de animales pequeños que mantienen en sus explotaciones.
5. Biodiversidad: La cooperativa dedica esfuerzos a la conservación de la ""colpa de loros"" que se encuentra en su propiedad, y promueve la reforestación y conservación de remanentes forestales. También tienen un proyecto que ofrece asistencia técnica y capacitación para el establecimiento y enriquecimiento de los bosques. El vivero de la cooperativa incluye especies forestales nativas de la Amazonia que se distribuyen gratuitamente a sus miembros. La cooperativa también promueve prácticas respetuosas con los polinizadores. En sus jardines clonales seleccionan variedades de cacao autóctonas e introducidas adaptadas a las condiciones locales. Los biofertilizantes que producen y aplican diversifican la microbiología edáfica y foliar.
6. Sinergia (gestión de las interacciones): Las operaciones de Colpa de Loros se ajustan a los requisitos de la certificación de agricultura orgánica. Controlan la incidencia de hongos diversificando la microbiología edáfica y foliar con la aplicación de materia orgánica y biofertilizantes de digestato. Proporcionan asistencia técnica e insumos para actividades de restauración y para el establecimiento de sistemas agroforestales, cercos vivos, amortiguadores ribereños. La cooperativa también ofrece capacitación/educación/asistencia para la adopción de la agricultura orgánica y de bajos insumos en el marco de la certificación de la agricultura orgánica.
7. Diversificación económica: Colpa de Loros pretende diversificar su portafolio de productos mediante la transformación de residuos y subproductos del cacao en, por ejemplo, nibs y destilado de cacao, para los que actualmente están identificando mercados. También están buscando medios financieros para poner en marcha un piloto de destilación de cacao y, además, tienen la visión de transformar el licor de cacao (i.e., la pasta de cacao pura) en chocolate para venderlo localmente. Ofrecen apoyo técnico y financiero para diversificar la dieta de sus miembros mediante una mayor diversidad de cultivos en sus huertos familiares.
8. Co-creación de conocimiento: Colpa de Loros promueve enfoques participativos para la generación de conocimiento (por ejemplo, intercambio de experiencias entre agricultores, conocimiento local y recursos fitogenéticos) a través de pasant","Diversificación productiva para incrementar la materia orgánica para fertilización en sistemas de cacao: Caso de inversión - Cooperativa Colpa de Loros  The following text section comes from a specific evidence file named URL https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169558: ""Diversificaci n productiva para incrementar la materia org nica para fertilizaci n en sistemas de cacao: Caso de inversi n - Cooperativa Colpa de Loros Skip to main content Communities & Collections Browse Navigate CGIAR Centers Statistics English Catal e tina Deutsch Espa ol Fran ais G idhlig Italiano Latvie u Magyar Nederlands Polski Portugu s Portugu s do Brasil Srpski (lat) Suomi Svenska T rk e Ti ng Vi t Y Log In Note: CGIAR users should log in with their Active Directory username and password.

Resumen ejecutivo
La Iniciativa Agroecología se desarrolló en la Región Ucayali, en la amazonia peruana. Su trabajo se focalizó en la cadena de valor del cacao, trabajando directamente con dos cooperativas de productores: Colpa de Loros y Banaqui Curimaná. Se apoyó a ambas cooperativas desde la evaluación agroecológica de su modelo de negocio y se acompañó en el proceso de diseño e implementación de prácticas agroecológicas. El presente Reporte Técnico describe el caso de la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros.
La Cooperativa Colpa de Loros es una organización de productores cacaoteros ubicada en el distrito de Neshuya, provincia de Padre Abad. Desde su constitución, el año 2015, tuvo una relación muy profunda con la empresa chocolatera francesa Kaoka, su principal cliente. El interés de Kaoka por el cacao fino de aroma que cultivan (parcialmente) los socios de Colpa de Loros, ha llevado a esta empresa fortalecer una relación estratégica con Colpa de Loros (práctica que desarrolla con otros socios proveedores en otros países), contribuyendo con diferentes iniciativas ambientales y sociales de la organización, con aportes propios o intermediando fondos de cooperación, como por ejemplo fondos del Fondo Francés para el Medio Ambiente Mundial – FFEM.
Una restricción para la producción orgánica de cacao de los productores socios de Colpa de Loros, es el acceso a fertilizantes orgánicos. El guano de isla, es un bien escaso, inaccesible para una significativa parte de los socios de Colpa de Loros; si bien la cooperativa cuenta con una planta de producción de compost orgánico, la misma sólo trabaja al 35% de su capacidad instalada, por limitaciones en el acceso a residuos provenientes de la producción agrícola, que deben generados por procesos orgánicos.
En este escenario, confluyó la idea de los socios, de producir arroz y caña de azúcar en forma orgánica, con el interés societario de poder incrementar la producción de compost y optimizar el uso de la planta procesadora, utilizando los residuos orgánicos de la producción de arroz y panela. La idea se incorporó a los lineamientos de trabajo de la organización. Algunos socios de la cooperativa producen a la fecha arroz orgánico, con el objetivo de consumir un alimento inocuo. Asimismo, existen en la zona, empresas medianas que producen caña de azúcar e iniciativas públicas que promueven el cultivo. Ambos productos (arroz y azúcar, que sería reemplazada por panela orgánica) son elementos esenciales de la dieta del poblador peruano; se propone reemplazar el consumo de arroz y azúcar convencionales, producidos con un alto volumen de agroquímicos, con arroz y panela orgánicos. La producción de arroz orgánico sería absorbida por el consumo de los productores, su entorno y la población de la localidad. La producción de panela, por los volúmenes que se producirían, requerirían ser canalizados a un mercado mayor, Pucallpa, Lima o el mercado de exportación.
El proyecto arroz orgánico contempla la instalación de 100Has de arroz, en los sectores de “El Triunfo” y “El Milagro”; la planta de pilado se instalaría en la sede principal de la Cooperativa, en el distrito de Neshuya. La producción de arroz se realizaría a secano, con una sola campaña anual. El costo de instalación de una Ha de arroz en secano se ha estimado en US$ 1,949 por Ha; para una inversión total de US$ 194,900 por campaña agrícola, inversión que sería cubierta por los socios que participen del proyecto (se espera obtener contrapartidas que apoyen a los productores). La inversión total en la planta piladora de arroz es de US$ 197,701, se espera que la Cooperativa pueda acceder a fondos de cooperación o concursables del gobierno peruano que apalanquen los recursos propios de la organización. La evaluación económica del proyecto, en un horizonte de cinco años ha determinado su viabilidad económica con un VAN económico de US$ 35,849, una TIR económica de 20.8% y una ratio de beneficio/costo de 1.04.
El proyecto caña de azúcar orgánica para panela contempla la instalación de 100Has de caña de azúcar, en los sectores de “Nolberth de Alto Uruya”, “Virgen del Carmen” y “Cadena Tropical”. La planta para la producción de panela se instalaría en centro poblado de Virgen del Carmen, que tiene una ubicación estratégica, central en la zona de producción y cuenta con las condiciones necesarias para la producción industrial. La Cooperativa Colpa de Loros ha adquirido el terreno donde se instalaría la planta industrial. La producción de caña de azúcar se realizaría a secano. El costo de instalación de una Ha de caña de azúcar en secano se ha estimado en US$ 4,444 por Ha; para una inversión total de US$ 444,400 por campaña agrícola. Los costos de mantenimiento de las cañas socas, oscilan alrededor de los US$ 2,000 anuales. La inversión en fincas sería cubierta por los socios que participen del proyecto (igualmente, se espera obtener contrapartidas que apoyen a los productores). La inversión total en la planta procesadora de panela es de US$ 482,449, al igual que en el proyecto de arroz, se espera que la Cooperativa pueda acceder a fondos de cooperación o concursables del gobierno peruano que apalanquen los recursos propios de la organización. La evaluación económica del proyecto, en un horizonte de cinco años ha determinado su viabilidad económica con un VAN económico de US$ 58,402, una TIR económica de 20.8% y una ratio de beneficio/costo de 1.03.

Ambos proyectos contribuirán con materia orgánica para la producción de abonos orgánicos. En el caso del arroz, son tres los residuos: cascarilla, polvillo y ñelen – arrocillo, con una producción total de los tres subproductos de 86.7TM a partir del segundo año. La producción de panela orgánica igualmente dejará tres residuos orgánicos: bagazo, cachaza y melaza; con una producción variable en el período de análisis, con una producción máxima de 1,305 TM conjuntas el primer año de producción.
Contexto
La Iniciativa de Agroecología del CGIAR, tiene como objetivo “desarrollar y ampliar innovaciones agroecológicas con pequeños agricultores y otros actores del sistema agrícola y alimentario, en diferentes contextos socioecológicos, en ocho países de ingresos bajos y medios”. La Iniciativa se desarrolló en Burkina Faso, India, Kenya, Laos, Perú, Senegal, Tunisia y Zimbabwe. En el caso del Perú, la iniciativa se implementó en la Región Ucayali, en la amazonia peruana. El trabajo en el caso peruano estuvo focalizado en la cadena de valor del cacao, uno de los principales cultivos basados en agricultura familiar de la región y del país. La iniciativa se implementó mediante cinco paquetes de trabajo, para atender todos los aspectos vinculados a la gestión agroecológica, los aspectos técnicos productivos, los de gobernanza, los financieros, las interrelaciones con el sector público y las políticas públicas, y los aspectos de mercado. Los cinco paquetes de trabajo desarrollaron sus actividades en forma interrelacionada, con la finalidad que “Los actores del sistema alimentario apliquen los principios agroecológicos adaptados a un contexto particular, desde la producción de alimentos hasta el consumo”. El paquete de trabajo 3 de la iniciativa, se desarrolló con el objeto de facilitar la implementación de “Modelos de negocio inclusivos con enfoque en principios agroecológicos”. En Perú se trabajó con las Cooperativa Colpa de Loros y Banaqui Curimaná. Se presenta a continuación el trabajo realizado en la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros.
La primera actividad desarrollada con la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros, fue el diagnóstico de situación, con un análisis transversal de la operación desde la perspectiva agroecológica. Desde los resultados del análisis se definieron y acordaron oportunidades de fortalecimiento para apoyar a la cooperativa en su transición agroecológica. Finalmente, empleando los recursos y las capacidades técnicas aportados por la Incubadora - Aceleradora de la Iniciativa de Agroecología, se formularon dos planes de negocio que responden a las necesidades y prioridades de la cooperativa buscan contribuir a su desempeño en varios principios agroecológicos.
La Cooperativa Colpa de Loros
La Cooperativa Agraria de Cacao Aromático Colpa de Loros, identificada con Registro Único de Contribuyente - RUC Nro 20600390911, se encuentra ubicada en el Centro Poblado El Triunfo, Km 66 de la Carretera Federico Basadre, distrito de Neshuya, provincia de Padre Abad, región Ucayali. La cooperativa fue creada en mayo del año 2015, estando debidamente constituida tanto en los Registros Públicos como en la Administración Tributaria del país (Sunat). Su gerente general, señor Ernesto Parra fue el facilitador – promotor de su constitución y es actualmente el representante legal de la organización. La Cooperativa se encuentra estratégicamente ubicada dentro del corredor agroforestal/ecológico de Ucayali. Además de su sede principal, cuenta con centros de acopio y procesamiento en Norbert del Alto Uruya, Virgen del Carmen y Ascensión de Aguaytillo.
La Misión de Colpa de Loros es “Somos una organización de agricultura orgánica comprometida con la salud, nutrición y el desarrollo sostenible a través de una alianza con socios fortalecidos con valores cooperativos”; su Visión es “En 2029, Ser una cooperativa líder y referente internacional en agricultura orgánica, alimentos saludables y la conservación ambiental de la mano con socios integralmente sostenibles”. Tomando como punto de partida las definiciones de su Misión y Visión, Colpa de Loros es una organización alineada con la producción ambiental y socialmente responsable, con una propuesta de valor que incorpora la producción sostenible. Desde su constitución, hasta la fecha, la cooperativa solamente ha trabajado en la cadena de valor del cacao, con énfasis en el cacao aromático. Este es preferido por diversas empresas chocolateras gracias a sus atributos de calidad y sabores diferenciados. Considerando de forma transversal los aspectos ambientales, Colpa de Loros busca ser una organización cooperativa generadora de beneficios económicos y sociales para sus asociados y la comunidad, mediante la producción y exportación directa rentable, sostenible y competitiva de cacao fino de aroma, aplicando las mejores prácticas agrícolas, sociales, ambientales y de gestión acordes con las tendencias del mercado.
Colpa de Loros opera bajo el modelo cooperativo. En tal sentido, cuanta con dos estamentos: el directivo y el ejecutivo. A nivel directivo, la máxima instancia es el Consejo de Administración. La organización, en concordancia con el modelo cooperativo, cuenta también con un Consejo de Vigilancia (órgano de control) y los comités de educación y electoral. Todos los miembros de los Consejos y Comités son elegidos en la Asamblea General de Socios y se renuevan de acuerdo con el mandato de la legislación peruana. El principal responsable ejecutivo es el gerente general. La estructura de la cooperativa es simple, con tres

áreas funcionales: i) asistencia técnica y certificaciones, de cara a la relación con los productores, ii) administración (finanzas, logística y comercialización) y iii) producción (específicamente de cacao y de abonos orgánicos).
Al cierre del año 2024, Colpa de Loros estaba conformada por 451 socios (aunque el número varia permanentemente por entrada y salida de socios), todos ellos productores de cacao. A la fecha de corte, la cooperativa contaba con 132 socias mujeres (29.3% del total) y 319 varones (70.3%). El consejo de administración, máximo órgano funcional de la organización está liderado por la Sra. Irene Chamaya, socia de la base Virgen del Carmen.
La cooperativa cuenta con 3 certificaciones: orgánica (USDA), Rainforest Alliance y Fair For Life (comercio justo). Cada explotación agrícola de los socios tiene un área promedio de 4.71 ha con cultivo de cacao, que con una productividad de 854.4 kg/ha. La cooperativa cuenta, en total con un área certificada como orgánica de 1,672Has (de las cuales 774Has son de cacao aromático). Las ventas son principalmente de exportación (a la empresa Kaoka, su socio comercial), pero también realizan ventas locales.
El trabajo de Colpa de Loros permite que pequeños productores cacaoteros tengan una propuesta de producción orgánica, ambientalmente sostenible, contribuyendo a la preservación de los suelos y del ecosistema en general. Además, han incorporado los lineamientos de trabajo de la producción libre de deforestación, de la masificación de los sistemas agroforestales en cacao y, complementariamente, la implementación de acuerdos privados de preservación. Todo ello con un enfoque de valor agregado, orientado a la producción de cacaos finos de aroma, con articulación directa con la empresa chocolatera Kaoka, que es el comprador final de la mayor parte de su producción. Como cooperativa tiene dos servicios sociales para sus socios: un sistema de créditos escolares, que adelanta recursos para la atención de las compras de útiles escolares y un fondo de apoyo social, para apoyar a socios y colaboradores en emergencias médicas o de fallecimiento.
Análisis del modelo de negocio
Durante el trabajo de análisis y diagnóstico de la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros, se aplicaron tres instrumentos para la recolección, sistematización y análisis de la información. En primer lugar, se empleó el Lienzo de Modelo de Negocios, incluyendo una discusión de como los principios agroecológicos se integraban en el modelo de negocio y propuesta de valor de la cooperativa. El segundo instrumento que se utilizó fue el Análisis FODA, una herramienta tradicional de la evaluación organizacional. El tercer instrumento fue la herramienta del B-ACT, construida específicamente para la toma de información de la organización, para cada uno de los 13 principios de la agroecología; sus prácticas, principios, objetivos, alcance y, desde las mismas, evaluar la profundidad del trabajo agroecológico a la fecha del análisis y las oportunidades mejora futura.
Lienzo del modelo de negocio agroecológico
Junto al equipo técnico y directivo de Colpa de Loros se analizaron los nueve componentes del Lienzo de Modelo de Negocios de la Cooperativa. Se presenta a continuación el resumen de los resultados obtenidos durante el trabajo de diagnóstico participativo llevado a cabo.
1. Clientes
Kaoka SAS, empresa chocolatera familiar francesa, es el socio comercial exclusivo de la cooperativa en Europa. Las primas de comercio justo que Kaoka otorga a la Cooperativa, junto con la financiación del FFEM (Fondo Francés para el Medio Ambiente Mundial), permiten que Biocacao, una ONG local, socio estratégico de Colpa de Loros, ejecute proyectos que restauran suelos degradados, promueven el cultivo de cacao aromático en sistemas agroforestales, firman acuerdos individuales y/o colectivos de conservación y administran sistemas de seguimiento de la deforestación. Kaoka también asume el costo de certificar a los miembros de Colpa de Loros en agricultura orgánica, esquema que cubre toda su finca y no sólo su producción de cacao. Colpa de Loros planea actualmente diversificar su portafolio de productos, agregando valor a sus residuos y subproductos de la producción de cacao (por ejemplo, trocitos y destilado de cacao).
2. Propuesta de valor
Se construyó la propuesta de valor de la cooperativa en dos frentes, de cara a los productores (su base social) y de cara a su principal cliente (Kaoka), que es aliado estratégico de su desarrollo institucional.
Hacia los productores: uno de los principales elementos en su propuesta de valor a sus socios es la oferta de precios competitivos, situados por encima de un mínimo garantizado y superior al recibido por otros productores de cacao de la región.

La cooperativa también ofrece acceso a crédito (o financiación) para cubrir costos de cosecha y compra de fertilizantes y equipos que suministra/vende a sus productores; y asistencia técnica y capacitaciones sobre diversos temas, que incluyen prácticas de producción sostenible, transición a la certificación orgánica, huertas caseras y diversificación nutricional. Finalmente, la cooperativa apoya a sus socios brindándoles créditos educativos y apoyo financiero en casos de accidentes, emergencias médicas, maternidad y entierros.
Para los clientes: Colpa de Loros garantiza a Kaoka SAS (su socio comercial exclusivo en Europa) el suministro de cacao fino de aroma, certificado por terceros correspondientes a organizaciones independientes de agricultura orgánica (con el sello Agriculture Biologique del Ministerio de Agricultura francés) y de producción y comercio socialmente responsables i.e., con los sellos de Fair Trade y Fair for Life). La cooperativa y sus productores seleccionan conjuntamente con Kaoka las variedades de cacao en función de las necesidades del fabricante de chocolate y del perfil de sus clientes. El procesamiento y la clasificación centralizados del cacao tras la cosecha (beneficiado) contribuyen además a garantizar un producto consistente de alta calidad.
3. Canales
Igualmente, se definieron los dos canales de la cooperativa, de cara a su red de abastecimiento y de cara a su cliente final.
Productores: Colpa de Loros cuenta actualmente con cuatro puntos de acopio, donde los productores asociados llevan sus cosechas de cacao. Estos puntos están distribuidos de tal manera que reducen las distancias de transporte para la mayoría de los productores.
Clientes: La cooperativa tiene con Kaoka un acuerdo de precio de exportación de cacao FOB (libre a bordo), en virtud del cual el fabricante de chocolate se hace cargo de los costos de transporte y seguros desde el puerto de salida.
4. Relaciones
Igualmente, redactadas en los dos extremos de su actividad comercial.
Productores: La cooperativa se comunica con sus socios productores a través de canales fluidos, que incluyen medios sociales como WhatsApp y Facebook. También organiza reuniones descentralizadas, que se priorizan según las distintas necesidades zonales de los productores y que se aprovechan para visitar las distintas regiones productoras. La cooperativa cuenta además con su propio programa de radio a través del cual emite comunicados e información que abarca una amplia variedad de temas.
Clientes: Colpa de Loros utiliza el teléfono, WhatsApp (entre otras redes sociales), Skype y correos electrónicos para mantener su comunicación con Kaoka, que además realiza cuatro visitas anuales a la cooperativa.
5. Fuentes de ingresos
La cooperativa acopia el cacao producido por sus socios, pagando por el mismo un precio superior al del mercado convencional. En el momento de la visita (año 2023), CdL pagaba 9,3 Soles/kg de cacao orgánico fino de aroma, respecto al pago por el cacao convencional de 7 Soles/kg, que realizaban otras cooperativas y acopiadores en la zona. La Cooperativa transfiere a sus socios el precio que obtiene por la venta, descontando los costos operativos y administrativos. Colpa de Loros, de cara a la venta, además del precio básico de mercado, que se negocia en las bolsas de Nueva York y Londres (precio que osciló entre los 2,600USD/ton y los 4,300 USD/ton durante el año 2023), recibe tres premios sobre el precio: USD 300 por tener el sello orgánico, más USD 240 por el sello de comercio justo y una prima de alta calidad de USD 160 por tonelada1.
Se presenta a continuación el valor total de las exportaciones de la Cooperativa Colpa de Loros. Cabe destacar que el incremento sustancial en las ventas del año 2024 se debe en gran parte al incremento del precio internacional, cuyo valor ha alcanzado casi un 200% de incremento en comparación con los años anteriores.
1 Durante el año 2024, el precio del cacao se incrementó hasta los US$ 12,000 por TM; el mayor precio histórico, por encima de cualquier escenario proyectado previo. Este nuevo escenario redujo el impacto positivo de los premios de precio que ofrece Colpa de Loros, que perdieron significancia respecto al valor total de venta de grano.

6. Recursos Clave
Los principales recursos con los que cuenta Colpa de Loros para sus operaciones son: i) planta de propagación clonal y viveros; ii) planta de compostaje; iii) puntos de acopio de cosechas; iv) planta centralizada de beneficiado de cacao; v) capital de trabajo; vi) crédito del programa ""Reactiva Perú""; vii) recursos financieros obtenidos a través de financiación competitiva; viii) certificaciones de agricultura orgánica, FT y FFL; ix) vehículos; x) 10 técnicos agrónomos; xi) 60 funcionarios de campo; y xii) 10 funcionarios administrativos.
7. Actividades principales
Las principales actividades de la cooperativa consisten en acopiar, procesar y comercializar cacao ecológico. Colpa de Loros proporciona formación y asistencia técnica además de los servicios y beneficios cooperativos que ofrece a sus miembros. También realiza actividades de divulgación dirigidas a posibles nuevos productores miembros. La ampliación de la capacidad de compostaje de la cooperativa puede generar suficiente fertilizante orgánico para involucrar a más productores en actividades de conservación/restauración, considerando que puede servir como moneda de cambio para incentivarlos, por ejemplo, hacia compromisos de deforestación cero.
8. Socios principales
Los principales socios de Colpa de Loros son los siguientes, junto con los bienes y servicios que proporcionan:
a) Los 451 socios de Colpa de Loros producen el cacao ecológico fino de aroma que la cooperativa consolida, procesa y comercializa. Colpa de Loros considera que el número actual de miembros limita la capacidad de la cooperativa para suministrar cacao orgánico de alta calidad de manera constante y, por lo tanto, están tratando de ampliar su membresía a un máximo de 1,000 productores.
b) Kaoka, que además de ser el socio comercial exclusivo de la cooperativa, cubre los gastos de certificación, financia los costos de la mano de obra que se dedica al control de calidad, cofinancia sus actividades de consolidación a un tipo de interés del 0% anual.
c) Agrobanco, una institución financiera de desarrollo.
d) Instituciones públicas como AGRO RURAL (Programa de Desarrollo Productivo Agrario Rural del Ministerio de Agricultura y Riego de Perú), INIA (Instituto Nacional de Innovación Agraria de Perú), SERFOR (Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre de Perú), que desarrolla el sistema de gestión de zonificación forestal y financia planes de reforestación y la implementación de sistemas agroforestales de cacao y el Servicio Nacional de Seguridad Agraria (SENASA).
e) Certificadoras como Ecocert y Flocert.
f) Otros aliados como: Cáritas Perú; Stein; La Alianza Bioversity-CIAT; ICRAF; El Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD) implementó el proyecto ""Paisajes Productivos Sostenibles en la Amazonía Peruana"".
La inestabilidad política amenaza la relación de Colpa de Loros con socios clave, especialmente los relacionados con el sector público.

Resultados de la herramienta de criterios empresariales Agroecológicos (B-ACT)
Se analizó el desempeño de la Cooperativa para cada uno de los trece principios de la agroecología, con una valoración final dada por la herramienta del B-ACT.
Se presenta un breve resumen del desempeño de Colpa de Loros para cada uno de los trece principios agroecológicos:
1. Reciclaje: La principal actividad en este componente es la producción de compost y otros fertilizantes orgánicos en la planta de compostaje de la cooperativa.
2. Reducción de insumos: La cooperativa recoge agua de lluvia en sus propias instalaciones, utiliza paneles solares para alimentar la iluminación de sus instalaciones y produce caldo bordelés y aceites hortícolas para el control de plagas y enfermedades de las plantas. Colpa de Loros también promueve y capacita a sus miembros en recolección de aguas lluvias, agricultura ecológica, producción de caldo bordelés y aceites hortícolas y control biológico de plagas.

3. Salud del suelo: Como fuente de nitrógeno orgánico, se promueve la aplicación de guano y estiércol. Además, se fomenta la inoculación de microorganismos de montaña.
4. Sanidad animal: Colpa de Loros ofrece asistencia a sus productores asociados en lo que concierne al almacenamiento y uso adecuado de los productos veterinarios que aplican a las especies de animales pequeños que mantienen en sus explotaciones.
5. Biodiversidad: La cooperativa dedica esfuerzos a la conservación de la ""colpa de loros"" que se encuentra en su propiedad, y promueve la reforestación y conservación de remanentes forestales. También tienen un proyecto que ofrece asistencia técnica y capacitación para el establecimiento y enriquecimiento de los bosques. El vivero de la cooperativa incluye especies forestales nativas de la Amazonia que se distribuyen gratuitamente a sus miembros. La cooperativa también promueve prácticas respetuosas con los polinizadores. En sus jardines clonales seleccionan variedades de cacao autóctonas e introducidas adaptadas a las condiciones locales. Los biofertilizantes que producen y aplican diversifican la microbiología edáfica y foliar.
6. Sinergia (gestión de las interacciones): Las operaciones de Colpa de Loros se ajustan a los requisitos de la certificación de agricultura orgánica. Controlan la incidencia de hongos diversificando la microbiología edáfica y foliar con la aplicación de materia orgánica y biofertilizantes de digestato. Proporcionan asistencia técnica e insumos para actividades de restauración y para el establecimiento de sistemas agroforestales, cercos vivos, amortiguadores ribereños. La cooperativa también ofrece capacitación/educación/asistencia para la adopción de la agricultura orgánica y de bajos insumos en el marco de la certificación de la agricultura orgánica.
7. Diversificación económica: Colpa de Loros pretende diversificar su portafolio de productos mediante la transformación de residuos y subproductos del cacao en, por ejemplo, nibs y destilado de cacao, para los que actualmente están identificando mercados. También están buscando medios financieros para poner en marcha un piloto de destilación de cacao y, además, tienen la visión de transformar el licor de cacao (i.e., la pasta de cacao pura) en chocolate para venderlo localmente. Ofrecen apoyo técnico y financiero para diversificar la dieta de sus miembros mediante una mayor diversidad de cultivos en sus huertos familiares.
8. Co-creación de conocimiento: Colpa de Loros promueve enfoques participativos para la generación de conocimiento (por ejemplo, intercambio de experiencias entre agricultores, conocimiento local y recursos fitogenéticos) a través de pasant"

Introduction
Geogoviya is an advanced smart farming platform designed to modernize agriculture by utilizing advanced technologies and data-driven insights. By integrating geographic information systems (GIS), satellite imagery, and real-time data collection, Geogoviya offers farmers precise and tailored solutions to optimize their agricultural practices.
The core functionality of the Geogoviya platform is organized into several sub-modules, including a dashboard, digitized land parcels, cash grants, data uploads, farmland management, and crop health monitoring. However, to ensure comprehensive functionality within Geogoviya, the platform currently lacks data-driven advisory services that can assist farmers in making informed decisions throughout the farming cycle. To address this gap, the CGIAR ClimBeR initiative has supported the development of an innovative tool called CultivatX. This tool enables the creation and dissemination of timely advisories on climate and agronomy, providing farmers with essential guidance when needed.
CultivateX is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize agricultural guidance by leveraging crop calendar-based data and integrating it with national information systems. Its primary goal is to directly provide farmers with timely, accurate, and actionable advice through SMS notifications. This innovative approach empowers farmers to make informed decisions, optimize their farming practices, and ultimately improve crop yields.
In the context of modern agriculture, which is a cornerstone of many economies, farmers face many challenges that hinder effective crop planning and food security. Climate variability, pest infestations, and market fluctuations create uncertainty in farming processes, affecting productivity and profitability. CultivateX addresses these issues by offering data-driven solutions that guide farmers throughout the growing season, enhancing their ability to adapt to changing conditions and maintain agricultural sustainability.
Workshop Objectives
The workshop's main objectives are to successfully integrate the ClimateX tool into the Geogoviya platform and officially transfer its management to the Department of Agriculture Development (DAD), Sri Lanka. This integration aims to enhance the platform's capacity to provide climate-smart agricultural advisories. Additionally, the workshop includes a comprehensive demonstration of the tool's functionalities, showcasing how it can be effectively used to support farming decisions. A key component of the workshop was the technical transfer of knowledge to the Divisional Secretariat Division (DSD) technical team, ensuring they are fully equipped to utilize and manage the ClimateX tool independently.

Introduction
Geogoviya is an advanced smart farming platform designed to modernize agriculture by utilizing advanced technologies and data-driven insights. By integrating geographic information systems (GIS), satellite imagery, and real-time data collection, Geogoviya offers farmers precise and tailored solutions to optimize their agricultural practices.
The core functionality of the Geogoviya platform is organized into several sub-modules, including a dashboard, digitized land parcels, cash grants, data uploads, farmland management, and crop health monitoring. However, to ensure comprehensive functionality within Geogoviya, the platform currently lacks data-driven advisory services that can assist farmers in making informed decisions throughout the farming cycle. To address this gap, the CGIAR ClimBeR initiative has supported the development of an innovative tool called CultivatX. This tool enables the creation and dissemination of timely advisories on climate and agronomy, providing farmers with essential guidance when needed.
CultivateX is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize agricultural guidance by leveraging crop calendar-based data and integrating it with national information systems. Its primary goal is to directly provide farmers with timely, accurate, and actionable advice through SMS notifications. This innovative approach empowers farmers to make informed decisions, optimize their farming practices, and ultimately improve crop yields.
In the context of modern agriculture, which is a cornerstone of many economies, farmers face many challenges that hinder effective crop planning and food security. Climate variability, pest infestations, and market fluctuations create uncertainty in farming processes, affecting productivity and profitability. CultivateX addresses these issues by offering data-driven solutions that guide farmers throughout the growing season, enhancing their ability to adapt to changing conditions and maintain agricultural sustainability.
Workshop Objectives
The workshop's main objectives are to successfully integrate the ClimateX tool into the Geogoviya platform and officially transfer its management to the Department of Agriculture Development (DAD), Sri Lanka. This integration aims to enhance the platform's capacity to provide climate-smart agricultural advisories. Additionally, the workshop includes a comprehensive demonstration of the tool's functionalities, showcasing how it can be effectively used to support farming decisions. A key component of the workshop was the technical transfer of knowledge to the Divisional Secretariat Division (DSD) technical team, ensuring they are fully equipped to utilize and manage the ClimateX tool independently.

Opening Remarks by Mr. A. H. M. L. Aberathne – Commissioner General, Department of Agrarian Development
H. M. L. Aberathne began by offering an overview of the status of the Geogoviya platform, emphasizing how it collects essential farmer information and integrates it into the system. He highlighted the platform’s effectiveness by citing a real-world example related to cash distribution (Figure 2). Through the implementation of the Geogoviya platform, remarkable savings of 500 million LKR1 were achieved during the 2023 Yala season. This case emphasizes the platform's capability to streamline processes and improve efficiency in agricultural support programs.
Mr. Aberathne elaborated on the need to enhance the platform by developing a main interface (Geogoviya landing page), noting that the current system primarily revolves around the Geogoviya dashboard. He stressed the importance of timely climate and weather advisories for farmers. In this critical area, the platform currently falls short due to the absence of a robust system for generating and disseminating such advisories. He explained that this gap in advisory services limits the ability to provide farmers with the crucial information they need to make informed decisions throughout the farming cycle.
In conclusion, Mr. Aberathne expressed his sincere gratitude to IWMI and the ClimBeR program for their invaluable support in strengthening the Geogoviya platform, enabling it to become a more comprehensive tool for agricultural development in Sri Lanka.

Reflections by Dr. Ana Maria Loboguerrero Rodriguez – CGIAR Climate Resilience Initiative Lead and Research Director, Climate Action, Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT
It is an honor to be here today to celebrate the handing over GeoGoviya Platform Main Interface and AgroClimate Advisory Dissemination Tool (CultivateX), a testament to Sri Lanka's commitment to harnessing technology for sustainable and prosperous agriculture.
GeoGoviya is more than just an app; it is a catalyst for change. This platform puts the power of data directly into the hands of our farmers. Real-time insights on weather patterns and crop conditions empower them to make informed decisions that save resources, boost yields, and enhance their livelihoods.
I see that GeoGoviya's impact extends far beyond individual farms. By aggregating data and providing actionable recommendations, we can address systemic challenges. We can optimize water use in an era of water scarcity, promote climate-resilient practices to safeguard our food supply, and link smallholder farmers to dynamic markets for more significant economic opportunities.
This platform represents a collaborative triumph, an excellent initiative by DAD and building the partnership with the government stakeholders and private sectors to ensure farmers could use the advanced information in the timely decision-making process. Together, we are embracing a future of data-driven agriculture and setting an example for other countries to learn from Sri Lanka.
GeoGoviya is a powerful first step. Let's continue this momentum! We transform agriculture by investing in innovation, strengthening partnerships, and ensuring farmers reap the benefits. It becomes a pillar of our economy and a beacon of sustainability and resilience for the future.

BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION
The Sri Lanka Anticipatory Action for Disaster Mitigation activities, conducted in collaboration with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and World Vision Lanka (WVL), seeks to set a model for effective disaster mitigation strategies. Galenbindunuweva Divisional Secretariat areas in the Anuradhapura district, are identified as the most vulnerable to drought. The pilot site for developing Anticipatory Action comprises communities in Dunumadalawa and Weheragala in the Allewewa Grama Niladhari Division (GND).
Implementation of the drought anticipatory action protocols aim to focus on the most vulnerable population within the designated GND, specifically those who are exposed to and likely to be significantly impacted by drought conditions. In the context of these activities, the term ""most vulnerable"" encompasses various demographics, including impoverished families, households led by females, pregnant women, and elderly communities. The goal is to tailor the Anticipatory Action Protocols to address the unique needs and challenges faced by these specific groups, ensuring a targeted and effective approach to mitigating the adverse effects of drought on these vulnerable populations1.
A comprehensive set of field activities was carried out in collaboration with the community and key stakeholders. These activities involved an extensive series of discussions, designed to engage participants in a meaningful dialogue. The primary purpose was to gather the most pertinent and insightful information directly from those involved, ensuring a thorough understanding of the issues at hand. These discussions were crucial in meeting the specific objectives outlined below, as they provided the context and data necessary to support informed decision- making and the achievement of our project goals.
OBJECTIVE OF THE VISIT
o To collect context-specific information and make observe gender and social inclusion aspects.
o To engage with key stakeholders crucial for planning and operationalizing anticipatory action.
DISCUSSION WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN DUNUMADALAWA AND WEHERAGALA
A general discussion was held focusing on the livelihoods and social networks of the families, specifically focusing on gender and social inclusion issues.

Relevance information to develop Anticipatory Action Protocols and simulation
The main occupation of the community that consist of about 170 families is agriculture. Except for a few families, all have access to land of varying acreage for cultivation. In the Maha season primary crops cultivated are paddy and maize. In the Yala season there is a greater mix of crops; vegetables (Brinjal, pumpkin, chilies, bitter guard), some acreage of ground nuts, sesame, mung bean, soya, as well as watermelon as a short-term filler crop.
Dunumadalawa and Weheragala are not served by any major or minor irrigation tank systems. Cultivation in both seasons is rain fed, including by a small village tank, supplemented with ground water extracted through agro-wells and tube wells.
Drinking water is accessed through filtered water points and private water sales. For other domestic purposes well water/tube well water is used. Cultivation in input intensive; seed material, fertilizer, agro- chemical incur high costs. Average acreage cultivated per family vary, could range from 2-7 acres. Some families likely cultivate larger areas2.
Some families keep small numbers of livestock; cattle, goats, chicken. Water for cultivation is not a concern, since all families either own or have access to agro- wells, tube wells, and irrigation pumps. In the recent past (at least last 10-12 years) this community has not faced drought periods impacting cultivation.
Maize, vegetable cops do not bring good yields (compared to previous years), due to poor quality seed material. Paddy yields are also low, in the range of 40-50 Bushels/acre (1 Bushel = 35.2390704 kg).
Seed material and other inputs for each cultivation season are taken on loan from the traders, who buy back the harvest of some crops such as maize. Vegetable harvest is sold to the Dambulla Economic Centre, where the traders dictate prices.
High cost of inputs and poor yields leave families with no profit, at best it is a break-even situation at the end of each cultivation season. The entire seasonal cultivation process is financed through loans. This has trapped the farming families in persistent cycles of debt.
Farmers in this community claim they do not receive advice from the Agrarian Services and/or Agriculture Extension Services. None have received any training. The choice of crops, farming practices adopted, are largely decided by their own knowledge and experience.
Families in the community (Figure 1) continue with farming, with limited alternative livelihoods to sustain themselves. Families are pressed to cultivate as many crop cycles as possible; i.e. if there is a two month window between the two main seasons, a short term crop such as water melon is cultivated.
Such practices are not informed decisions based on any advice from the officials, and they insert additional pressure on family labour supply, especially on females in the family to work in the fields without a break.
There are several village organisations: Farmer Organisation (deals with planning and issues related to paddy cultivation); Death Donation Society, Women’s Society, Samurdhi Society, Mosque related societies. These organisations serve both financial and social functions.
For instance, women are able to get personal loans 700 – 1000 (USD) at 3% monthly interest rate by being a member of Women’s orgnaisation. This compares to 10% monthly interest rate for a loan from the money lender.
2 Discussion did not allow getting details on the areas cultivated.

Figure 1: Discussion with Farmers (Photo: IWMI/ClimBeR, 2024)
Most critical issues related to agriculture-based livelihoods faced by this community:
- Low quality seed material leading to:
o Lower germination rate
o Low quality plant stock susceptible to pests and diseases
o Requirements of higher amounts of fertilizer and other chemical inputs
o Poor and lower quality harvests
Indebtedness to money lenders to finance cultivation, inability to break out from debt cycles
- Lack of information, knowledge, advice on adapting farming practices with the changes in climate/weather patterns, the main reason for their inability to negotiate with those dominate the input and produce markets
- What keeps them going is survival, with no other alternative livelihood options, and the desire to educate their children
Discussion on seed related concerns expressed by farmers
- The government engagement in seed production is largely limited to paddy. Seed requirements for the rest of the crops (OFC s- food grains, fruits, vegetables) is covered by the private sector.
- While Department of Agriculture Development (DAD) office maintains close interactions with the farming community in the Galenbindunuwewa area, they are not aware of poor-quality seed material, and the poor overall production outcomes that has been the experience of the community in Dunumadalawa and Weheragala for several years and cultivation seasons. Farmers in Galenbidunuwewa area have not brought such an issue to the attention of DAD.
December 24 | Field Consultation Report on Anticipatory Action in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka

- Further, in view of the DAD, there are observations that indicate situation concerning seed material is otherwise; farmers from neighboring areas such as Horowpathana purchase seed material from the 4 suppliers in Galenbidunuwewa who operate the seed market.
- Contrary to the experience shared by the Dunumadalawa and Weheragala farming community, the Division Officer, Galenbidunuwewa is of the firm view that over 80% farmers in the area do not experience money/income issues. He shared by way of an indicator, that out of all the Bank of Ceylon branches in Anuradhapura District, Galenbidunuwewa is considered the best in terms of the volume of deposits, which also record minimum withdrawals. In his view, it is more likely farmers lack knowledge how to manage.
- This discussion compelled meeting farmers from other areas, to discuss production related issues, especifically cross checking on the concerns expressed on the quality of seed material, and the continuous indebtedness of the farmers to the suppliers.
Recommended by the Division Officer of the DAD, discussions were held with farmers Ruwan, Piyasiri Kulathunga and Biso Manika (family unit- husband and wife), U.G Elisa & Nilmini Gunasinghe (family unit – mother and daughter in law).

Figure 2: Discussion with Mr. Ruwan (Photo: IWMI/ClimBeR, 2024)
- During the discussion with IWMI consutant Mr. Ruwan cultivates a relatively large area, about 70 acres, with paddy and other field crops (Figure 2). He has received a training under the ‘Agriculture Modernization Project’, a training programme conducted for selected farmers, about 2 years ago. This has given him knowledge and awareness to plan production and marketing to minimize losses.
- He confirmed that seed material in the market are often adulterated, and of poor quality. As a farmer, he takes a few extra steps to verify and establish the quality of seed before planting (such as barcode verification, contacting the company issuing the seed to verify authenticity, batch numbers/expiry date).

Further, he studies the market trends in the Dambulla Economic Centre (recent years), and has worked out a network to get in contact with the Krushikarma Sanvardhana Niladhari in the area and Agriculture Instructors, and other focal persons to inform his decisions on the crops to be cultivated to avoid facing gluts, overall losses in production and marketing.

- Ruwan is also able to track weather information though weather applications, to guide his cultivation decisions.
- Ruwan is of the view that the only way to tackle the irregularities and exploitative forces of the input market (seed, fertilizer), and the output market (Dambulla Economic Centre) is for the farmers to develop their own levels of awareness and knowledge to make informed decisions.
- Piyasiri Kulathunga and Biso Manika cultivate over 5 acres, mainly paddy and OFC s (maize, vegetables, oranges etc. In addition, Piyasiri also works as a vegetable supplier to Dambulla Economic Centre.

Seed quality and plant diseases continue to be challenges, also the elephant attacks.

They have not suffered any major losses over the last few seasons, owing to the larger size of the farm, diversified crop combinations, ability to hire/access labour, machinery and equipment, connectivity with the DAD services, as well as the alternative income avenues. Therefore, the family has managed without being in continuous debt cycles.
- U.G Elisa & Nilmini Gunasinghe, cultivate a small plot of about 2 acres as a family.
- Lack of adequate technical knowledge on agriculture practices leading to sub- optimal production related decisions, followed by poor seed quality, high cost of inputs, and unfavorable market forces persistently work against them from achieving successful crop yields and income.

The two women (aged 73 and 46 respectively) cycle 5 km each day to come to the plot. Brinjals, long beans and chillies have been planted 5 months ago, after manually preparing the land. After several rounds of fertilizer, brinjal and chillie plants have not risen as expected, and have borne hardy any fruit.

- They are now considering ploughing them back to soil, to sow cowpea and mung bean, which are less input intensive.
- This family has lost the entire investment made on agriculture inputs (taken on loan from money lenders), and their labour inputs over the last 05 months.
- Further, this plot is also subject to elephant attacks. Elephants have destroyed and consumed patches of beans, chillies, and partially destroyed the temporary hut in the plot, where they keep the utensils etc.
- Government has initiated constructing an electric fence to ward off elephants, however this has been halted several times, due to contractor and payment issues. Getting a fence to protect their plot area is estimated to cost approximately at Rs 60,000/, this is unaffordable sum for the family.
Farmers who are at the economic and social standing of Ruwan, and Piyasiri are connected with the institutional resources (eg. DAD), have the means to network to access information for making informed production decisions. Both are able to use machinery and hire labour for production activities.
Whereas Elisa and Nilmini belong to the poorer strata of farmers, who are severely in the debt trap, struggling to recover. Most of the families in the Dunumadalawa and Weheragala community seem to belong to the poorer strata of farmers.
Stickler consultation
Department of Agrarian Development (DAD) Officer, Galenbindunuwewa
- There are 9000 farmers registered in the records of the Galenbidunuwewa Division (records are maintained from 2017)
- There is a Krushikarma Sanwardhana Niladhari assigned for each Sub- division, who closely interact with farmers to provide production related services. They also represent the DAD at the kanna meetings held by Farmer Organizations.
- Agriculture production related trainings are conducted by the Agriculture Instructure system of the Agriculture Department.
Additional Director, Disaster Management Centre, Anuradhapura
Mr. Sanath Dissanayaka
- Main disaster issues in the area are floods and drought (Figure 4). Floods being s sudden onset disaster, daily monitoring and preparedness measures are given close attention.
- Accessing quality drinking water is a challenge, currently all drinking water distributed is filtered, except those distributed from water bowsers.
- In the drought periods people find their own ways of sustaining themselves facing many hardships, by accessing water through tube wells, agro-wells etc.
- DMC approach to identifying most vulnerable groups is conventional. As explained by way of an example, in conducting an evacuation, women, children and the elderly are evacuated first. At the field level, addressing gender based issues, other most vulnerable groups is not feasible in the current working conditions, where resources and staff support is limited.

Gender and Social Inclusion considerations
Gender based aspects:
In this community, there is gender division of labour in production and in domestic activities
- Main livelihood of men and women is work in agriculture activities – work in family land, also as wage labourers
- Women and men carry out the required workloads and duties related to production by each party
- Women have the main responsibility for taking care of the daily household reproduction functions such as food preparation, cleaning, washing
Tending to livestock is mainly carried out by women
- While there are some clear lines of division in male and female activities, there also seem to be tendency where family members share work responsibilities in the fields, care of the animals, as situations demand.
- There are 25 female headed households (15% of the total population)3 in the Dunumadalawa community, whose main livelihood is agriculture production, through work in the family farms and through participating in agriculture wage labour.
- Daily wage rates vary for women and men; women are paid 40% less than men, including for similar tasks: wage rate for males- Rs. 2,500, lunch provided; female Rs.1, 500, no lunch provided
3 Total number of families- 170

- While it was admitted (by those who employ wage labour), that in some tasks female labour is more efficient, the established payment systems cannot be broken, and continue to be in practice.
- Several women mentioned facing severe health issues related to being engaged in continuous hard/manual labour in the agriculture fields, especially when it is not possible to hire labour on wages or rent equipment (due to lack of resources).
- When money is short for cultivation activities, one of the first options is to pawn jewelry at the bank or to a private pawn broker. Being trapped in the debt cycles for several years, there are no payback possibilities to recover the jewelry items. Instead, interest is paid year after year, in the hope of recovery.
- Women are striving to find a way to break from the debt trap, have resources to educate their children, have a break from having to work continuously in the field doing manual labour (limiting to 2 seasons).
Other marginalised groups
Main categories:
- Female headed households – marginalized mainly due to their dependency for cultivation based livelihood support, challenges faced in accessing services
Elderly- depend on the support from the family members
- People with disabilities
People affected by kidney disease (Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology- CKDU)
- Widows (without family support)
- Families without land for cultivation
More specifically in this community4:
o 300 persons in the community are over 60 years of age out of a 630 total population (47%)
o 8 persons affected by CKDU are on regular government support scheme (Rs 175 USD a month)
o 1 person receiving the government allowance for disability (there could be other persons with disabilities who are not in the records of the Grama Niladahri)
o Low income persons registered for ‘Aswesuma’ payments (figures not available)
Government support schemes include:
- Allowance of 35 USD/- per month for those aged over 70 yrs
- A payment of Rs 3200 USD/- for pregnant mothers to access food items during the pregnancy
- Aswesuma for low income people
- Allowance ranging from 1-4 USD for low income people
- Allowance for people with disabilities (those registered, the amount depends on the nature of disability)
Gender and Social Inclusion Issues of consideration in developing Anticipatory Action (AA) protocols

- Issues that concern women, their needs and challenges require recognition and attention. Women need to be consulted in planning and implementing AA protocols. This can be ensured through formulating a women’s group within the community as part of the AA planning and consultation. In a general discussion setting women do not necessarily come forward with their specific concerns/ideas/proposals.
- Both men and women in the community do not have knowledge/awareness necessary for climate adaptations, technical knowledge to deal with agricultural production challenges such as poor-quality seed, choice of crops, optimizing inputs, marketing issues.
- In developing AA protocols these issues need to be approached in a gender responsive manner; i.e. taking into consideration that 15 % of the households are female headed and they are farmers, as well as in the rest of the families the main livelihood of the women is farming and their knowledge, awareness is critical for succeeding with AA.
- There are CKDU patients, elderly, people in low income groups (without any land to cultivate, who depend on casual labour), who are dealing with unique sets of challenges. These issues need to be identified, and require specific consideration in the AA protocols. This may involve consultation and engagement in planning, providing/accessing information and in execution.
- There is a group of young people, a few of whom are in university education, schooling -OL/AL who will be joining the labour force, including the agriculture production. This group need to be specifically consulted for their concerns and ideas (in a general setting, with the elderly they do not seem to speak out).

BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION
The Sri Lanka Anticipatory Action for Disaster Mitigation activities, conducted in collaboration with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and World Vision Lanka (WVL), seeks to set a model for effective disaster mitigation strategies. Galenbindunuweva Divisional Secretariat areas in the Anuradhapura district, are identified as the most vulnerable to drought. The pilot site for developing Anticipatory Action comprises communities in Dunumadalawa and Weheragala in the Allewewa Grama Niladhari Division (GND).
Implementation of the drought anticipatory action protocols aim to focus on the most vulnerable population within the designated GND, specifically those who are exposed to and likely to be significantly impacted by drought conditions. In the context of these activities, the term ""most vulnerable"" encompasses various demographics, including impoverished families, households led by females, pregnant women, and elderly communities. The goal is to tailor the Anticipatory Action Protocols to address the unique needs and challenges faced by these specific groups, ensuring a targeted and effective approach to mitigating the adverse effects of drought on these vulnerable populations1.
A comprehensive set of field activities was carried out in collaboration with the community and key stakeholders. These activities involved an extensive series of discussions, designed to engage participants in a meaningful dialogue. The primary purpose was to gather the most pertinent and insightful information directly from those involved, ensuring a thorough understanding of the issues at hand. These discussions were crucial in meeting the specific objectives outlined below, as they provided the context and data necessary to support informed decision- making and the achievement of our project goals.
OBJECTIVE OF THE VISIT
o To collect context-specific information and make observe gender and social inclusion aspects.
o To engage with key stakeholders crucial for planning and operationalizing anticipatory action.
DISCUSSION WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN DUNUMADALAWA AND WEHERAGALA
A general discussion was held focusing on the livelihoods and social networks of the families, specifically focusing on gender and social inclusion issues.

Relevance information to develop Anticipatory Action Protocols and simulation
The main occupation of the community that consist of about 170 families is agriculture. Except for a few families, all have access to land of varying acreage for cultivation. In the Maha season primary crops cultivated are paddy and maize. In the Yala season there is a greater mix of crops; vegetables (Brinjal, pumpkin, chilies, bitter guard), some acreage of ground nuts, sesame, mung bean, soya, as well as watermelon as a short-term filler crop.
Dunumadalawa and Weheragala are not served by any major or minor irrigation tank systems. Cultivation in both seasons is rain fed, including by a small village tank, supplemented with ground water extracted through agro-wells and tube wells.
Drinking water is accessed through filtered water points and private water sales. For other domestic purposes well water/tube well water is used. Cultivation in input intensive; seed material, fertilizer, agro- chemical incur high costs. Average acreage cultivated per family vary, could range from 2-7 acres. Some families likely cultivate larger areas2.
Some families keep small numbers of livestock; cattle, goats, chicken. Water for cultivation is not a concern, since all families either own or have access to agro- wells, tube wells, and irrigation pumps. In the recent past (at least last 10-12 years) this community has not faced drought periods impacting cultivation.
Maize, vegetable cops do not bring good yields (compared to previous years), due to poor quality seed material. Paddy yields are also low, in the range of 40-50 Bushels/acre (1 Bushel = 35.2390704 kg).
Seed material and other inputs for each cultivation season are taken on loan from the traders, who buy back the harvest of some crops such as maize. Vegetable harvest is sold to the Dambulla Economic Centre, where the traders dictate prices.
High cost of inputs and poor yields leave families with no profit, at best it is a break-even situation at the end of each cultivation season. The entire seasonal cultivation process is financed through loans. This has trapped the farming families in persistent cycles of debt.
Farmers in this community claim they do not receive advice from the Agrarian Services and/or Agriculture Extension Services. None have received any training. The choice of crops, farming practices adopted, are largely decided by their own knowledge and experience.
Families in the community (Figure 1) continue with farming, with limited alternative livelihoods to sustain themselves. Families are pressed to cultivate as many crop cycles as possible; i.e. if there is a two month window between the two main seasons, a short term crop such as water melon is cultivated.
Such practices are not informed decisions based on any advice from the officials, and they insert additional pressure on family labour supply, especially on females in the family to work in the fields without a break.
There are several village organisations: Farmer Organisation (deals with planning and issues related to paddy cultivation); Death Donation Society, Women’s Society, Samurdhi Society, Mosque related societies. These organisations serve both financial and social functions.
For instance, women are able to get personal loans 700 – 1000 (USD) at 3% monthly interest rate by being a member of Women’s orgnaisation. This compares to 10% monthly interest rate for a loan from the money lender.
2 Discussion did not allow getting details on the areas cultivated.

Figure 1: Discussion with Farmers (Photo: IWMI/ClimBeR, 2024)
Most critical issues related to agriculture-based livelihoods faced by this community:
- Low quality seed material leading to:
o Lower germination rate
o Low quality plant stock susceptible to pests and diseases
o Requirements of higher amounts of fertilizer and other chemical inputs
o Poor and lower quality harvests
Indebtedness to money lenders to finance cultivation, inability to break out from debt cycles
- Lack of information, knowledge, advice on adapting farming practices with the changes in climate/weather patterns, the main reason for their inability to negotiate with those dominate the input and produce markets
- What keeps them going is survival, with no other alternative livelihood options, and the desire to educate their children
Discussion on seed related concerns expressed by farmers
- The government engagement in seed production is largely limited to paddy. Seed requirements for the rest of the crops (OFC s- food grains, fruits, vegetables) is covered by the private sector.
- While Department of Agriculture Development (DAD) office maintains close interactions with the farming community in the Galenbindunuwewa area, they are not aware of poor-quality seed material, and the poor overall production outcomes that has been the experience of the community in Dunumadalawa and Weheragala for several years and cultivation seasons. Farmers in Galenbidunuwewa area have not brought such an issue to the attention of DAD.
December 24 | Field Consultation Report on Anticipatory Action in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka

- Further, in view of the DAD, there are observations that indicate situation concerning seed material is otherwise; farmers from neighboring areas such as Horowpathana purchase seed material from the 4 suppliers in Galenbidunuwewa who operate the seed market.
- Contrary to the experience shared by the Dunumadalawa and Weheragala farming community, the Division Officer, Galenbidunuwewa is of the firm view that over 80% farmers in the area do not experience money/income issues. He shared by way of an indicator, that out of all the Bank of Ceylon branches in Anuradhapura District, Galenbidunuwewa is considered the best in terms of the volume of deposits, which also record minimum withdrawals. In his view, it is more likely farmers lack knowledge how to manage.
- This discussion compelled meeting farmers from other areas, to discuss production related issues, especifically cross checking on the concerns expressed on the quality of seed material, and the continuous indebtedness of the farmers to the suppliers.
Recommended by the Division Officer of the DAD, discussions were held with farmers Ruwan, Piyasiri Kulathunga and Biso Manika (family unit- husband and wife), U.G Elisa & Nilmini Gunasinghe (family unit – mother and daughter in law).

Figure 2: Discussion with Mr. Ruwan (Photo: IWMI/ClimBeR, 2024)
- During the discussion with IWMI consutant Mr. Ruwan cultivates a relatively large area, about 70 acres, with paddy and other field crops (Figure 2). He has received a training under the ‘Agriculture Modernization Project’, a training programme conducted for selected farmers, about 2 years ago. This has given him knowledge and awareness to plan production and marketing to minimize losses.
- He confirmed that seed material in the market are often adulterated, and of poor quality. As a farmer, he takes a few extra steps to verify and establish the quality of seed before planting (such as barcode verification, contacting the company issuing the seed to verify authenticity, batch numbers/expiry date).

Further, he studies the market trends in the Dambulla Economic Centre (recent years), and has worked out a network to get in contact with the Krushikarma Sanvardhana Niladhari in the area and Agriculture Instructors, and other focal persons to inform his decisions on the crops to be cultivated to avoid facing gluts, overall losses in production and marketing.

- Ruwan is also able to track weather information though weather applications, to guide his cultivation decisions.
- Ruwan is of the view that the only way to tackle the irregularities and exploitative forces of the input market (seed, fertilizer), and the output market (Dambulla Economic Centre) is for the farmers to develop their own levels of awareness and knowledge to make informed decisions.
- Piyasiri Kulathunga and Biso Manika cultivate over 5 acres, mainly paddy and OFC s (maize, vegetables, oranges etc. In addition, Piyasiri also works as a vegetable supplier to Dambulla Economic Centre.

Seed quality and plant diseases continue to be challenges, also the elephant attacks.

They have not suffered any major losses over the last few seasons, owing to the larger size of the farm, diversified crop combinations, ability to hire/access labour, machinery and equipment, connectivity with the DAD services, as well as the alternative income avenues. Therefore, the family has managed without being in continuous debt cycles.
- U.G Elisa & Nilmini Gunasinghe, cultivate a small plot of about 2 acres as a family.
- Lack of adequate technical knowledge on agriculture practices leading to sub- optimal production related decisions, followed by poor seed quality, high cost of inputs, and unfavorable market forces persistently work against them from achieving successful crop yields and income.

The two women (aged 73 and 46 respectively) cycle 5 km each day to come to the plot. Brinjals, long beans and chillies have been planted 5 months ago, after manually preparing the land. After several rounds of fertilizer, brinjal and chillie plants have not risen as expected, and have borne hardy any fruit.

- They are now considering ploughing them back to soil, to sow cowpea and mung bean, which are less input intensive.
- This family has lost the entire investment made on agriculture inputs (taken on loan from money lenders), and their labour inputs over the last 05 months.
- Further, this plot is also subject to elephant attacks. Elephants have destroyed and consumed patches of beans, chillies, and partially destroyed the temporary hut in the plot, where they keep the utensils etc.
- Government has initiated constructing an electric fence to ward off elephants, however this has been halted several times, due to contractor and payment issues. Getting a fence to protect their plot area is estimated to cost approximately at Rs 60,000/, this is unaffordable sum for the family.
Farmers who are at the economic and social standing of Ruwan, and Piyasiri are connected with the institutional resources (eg. DAD), have the means to network to access information for making informed production decisions. Both are able to use machinery and hire labour for production activities.
Whereas Elisa and Nilmini belong to the poorer strata of farmers, who are severely in the debt trap, struggling to recover. Most of the families in the Dunumadalawa and Weheragala community seem to belong to the poorer strata of farmers.

- Female headed households – marginalized mainly due to their dependency for cultivation based livelihood support, challenges faced in accessing services
Elderly- depend on the support from the family members
- People with disabilities
People affected by kidney disease (Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology- CKDU)
- Widows (without family support)
- Families without land for cultivation
More specifically in this community4:
o 300 persons in the community are over 60 years of age out of a 630 total population (47%)
o 8 persons affected by CKDU are on regular government support scheme (Rs 175 USD a month)
o 1 person receiving the government allowance for disability (there could be other persons with disabilities who are not in the records of the Grama Niladahri)
o Low income persons registered for ‘Aswesuma’ payments (figures not available)
Government support schemes include:
- Allowance of 35 USD/- per month for those aged over 70 yrs
- A payment of Rs 3200 USD/- for pregnant mothers to access food items during the pregnancy
- Aswesuma for low income people
- Allowance ranging from 1-4 USD for low income people
- Allowance for people with disabilities (those registered, the amount depends on the nature of disability)

- Issues that concern women, their needs and challenges require recognition and attention. Women need to be consulted in planning and implementing AA protocols. This can be ensured through formulating a women’s group within the community as part of the AA planning and consultation. In a general discussion setting women do not necessarily come forward with their specific concerns/ideas/proposals.
- Both men and women in the community do not have knowledge/awareness necessary for climate adaptations, technical knowledge to deal with agricultural production challenges such as poor-quality seed, choice of crops, optimizing inputs, marketing issues.
- In developing AA protocols these issues need to be approached in a gender responsive manner; i.e. taking into consideration that 15 % of the households are female headed and they are farmers, as well as in the rest of the families the main livelihood of the women is farming and their knowledge, awareness is critical for succeeding with AA.
- There are CKDU patients, elderly, people in low income groups (without any land to cultivate, who depend on casual labour), who are dealing with unique sets of challenges. These issues need to be identified, and require specific consideration in the AA protocols. This may involve consultation and engagement in planning, providing/accessing information and in execution.
- There is a group of young people, a few of whom are in university education, schooling -OL/AL who will be joining the labour force, including the agriculture production. This group need to be specifically consulted for their concerns and ideas (in a general setting, with the elderly they do not seem to speak out).

Introduction
The Climate Smart Governance (CSG) platform aims to support climate adaptation through effective data management, project tracking, and policy-making tools. The Climate Smart Governance (CSG) Dashboard is an advanced technological tool developed to support governments, institutions, and other key stakeholders in addressing climate-related challenges. It provides accurate, real-time data on climate hazards, population vulnerabilities, projected climate scenarios, and sector-specific information, including water, health, agriculture, ecosystems, and infrastructure. Additionally, the dashboard consolidates information on climate-related projects, fostering coordinated, mid- to long-term adaptation planning that aligns with global development goals, such as the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The CSG Dashboard integrates cutting-edge data analytics, machine learning, and real-time environmental monitoring systems to deliver actionable insights into sustainable practices and climate policies. These features make it an essential tool for informed decision-making and effective policy formulation. The dashboard plays a pivotal role in guiding governments, public agencies, and private sector entities toward well-coordinated, data- driven adaptation strategies, ensuring that climate risks are addressed comprehensively and collaboratively.
Designed with the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process in mind, the CSG Dashboard offers a dedicated platform for public and private sector entities to access and leverage up-to-date information. This empowers them to:
o Develop effective, coordinated adaptation policies,
o Current and future climate variability and hazard scores
o Monitor and evaluate progress of climate projects,
o Monitoring the progress of SDG gals and tracking the National Determined Contribution (NDC)
o Geospatial data visualization for project preparation, monitoring, and coordination among the users
o Share information on best practices and investment opportunities for climate resilience.
The CSG Dashboard is part of the CGIAR initiative on Climate Resilience, known as ClimBeR. Its primary objective is to assist nations in executing the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) NAP process. The NAP process is iterative and continuous, aiming to build adaptive capacity and resilience in the face of climate change, while reducing vulnerabilities through the integration of adaptation measures into national, sectoral, and local policies and programs. This report consolidates the technological development and deployment processes involved in the CSG platform under the ClimBeR project.

Introduction
The contribution of Kenya to Green House Gas (GHG) emissions globally stands at less than 0.1 percent in 2018. On the other hand, the country's GHG emission is growing at an average rate of 4.4 percent per year between 2001 and 2019 (World Bank, 2023). With an increased emission rate, national annual emissions related to agriculture, Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF), energy, industrial processes plus product use, and waste increased from 56.9 MtCO2 eq in 1995 to 93.7 MtCO2 eq in 2015, showing an increase of 65 percent. Kenya's updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) committed to reducing GHG emissions by 32 percent by 2030 from the projected BAU of 143 MtCO2 eq in tandem with the sustainable development agenda (UNFCC, 2022).
In Kenya, the average number of hot days and nights per year has increased by approximately 15.6 percent and 31 percent, respectively, from 1960 to 2003. Increased variability in rainfall patterns with increased extreme precipitation and dry spells has also been observed. Wet areas, like the highlands, have reliable rainfall, and low plateaus and arid regions are generally dry. Over the last three decades, the average annual rainfall has been about 726 mm, with two major rainy seasons between March to May and October to December. With increased rainfall variability since the sixties, the contrast between the wetter northern regions and the drier southern regions has greatly intensified. Since the year 2000, increasing frequency and seriousness of extreme rainfall events along with lengthier arid spells across the arid areas have been observed (Detelinova, et al., 2023).
Kenya has made significant strides in implementing climate adaptation and resilience measures, particularly highlighted during the recent African Climate Change Summit in Nairobi (UNFCC, n.d). This summit emphasized the need for collaboration with international partners and the development of tools for effective monitoring and reporting on climate change issues. The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) for 2015-2030 is central to Kenya's efforts, aligning with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) guidelines and the Paris Agreement. The Kenyan government has established a robust framework that includes various national policies, such as the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2018-2022, which integrates climate considerations across all sectors of the economy. The NCCAP aims to enhance resilience to climate impacts while reducing the GHG emissions, showcasing a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change challenges. Moreover, establishing the National Climate Change Council ensures high-level political support and effective coordination of climate actions across different governmental levels.
In addition to these strategic frameworks, Kenya actively engages local communities and stakeholders to bolster its climate resilience initiatives. For instance, the Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Framework Programme is designed to enhance agricultural productivity while adapting to changing climatic conditions (United Nations, 2023). This program requires substantial capacity building and resource allocation to ensure its success in various sectors such as agriculture, livestock, and fisheries. Furthermore, Kenya's commitment to climate adaptation is evident through its participation in readiness projects with the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which has facilitated training for over 700 technical staff and journalists in climate-related planning and implementation. Although these efforts are setting a foundation for sustainable long-term climate change adaptation, there is a need for more robust tools that will help collaboration among various stakeholders for mapping and making timely decisions to avert future vulnerabilities.
Climate change is a problem that Kenya is grappling with, especially within the agricultural sector and the management of water resources, which impact food security and the economy. High levels of fragmented governance, poor access to climate applicable technologies, and poor policy making that does not incorporate local and national adaptation strategies, further compound these challenges. Even worse, smallholder farmers, who are the mainstay of the agricultural economy in Kenya, possess limited resources to adopt or implement sustainable practices or sufficiently respond to climate shocks. The ClimBeR innovations, comprising the Climate-Smart Governance (CSG) and Multiscale Polycentric Governance (MPG) tools, offer a more holistic solution to these concerns. Data collection and analysis as well as resource allocation for new strategies are included in local governance to promote climate change resilience. Using these tools, Kenya can ensure it commits to transforming its adaptation processes sustainably to reflect its Nationally Determined Contributions as well as long-term adaptation plan.

This policy brief underscores the role of CSG dashboard and MPG tool to guide in addressing Kenya’s adaptation needs for climate change impacts.
CSG and MPG tools for transformative
adaptation
The CSG dashboard and MPG tool guide, developed by International Water Management Institute through the CGIAR’s Climate Resilience initiative “ClimBeR”, are comprehensive tools that can facilitate governance in adaptation interventions under climate change. Both tools emerge as vital instruments providing frameworks that enhance multi-level coordination and transformative adaptation strategies.
The dashboard is designed to support decision-makers by integrating climate adaptation into national and subnational development planning. It emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement and institutional capacity building, which are essential for effective governance in climate adaptation. The dashboard includes comprehensive risk assessments, strategic action plans, and investment planning tools that help identify priority areas for intervention. By fostering cross-sectoral approaches, including nature-based solutions, the Dashboard aligns with Kenya’s broader climate resilience goals and supports the implementation of climate-smart strategies across various sectors.
Its monitoring and evaluation tools complement the Dashboard's functionalities, ensuring resource allocation transparency and accountability (Amarasinghe et al., 2023). These tools enable officers to map vulnerable areas, design spatially targeted adaptation options, and effectively track project progress and outcomes, thereby enhancing climate adaptation initiatives' overall impact. Integrating data analytics, geospatial tools, and climate outlooks within the dashboard provides stakeholders with critical insights for informed decision-making. Additionally, the platform facilitates shared learning through resources like the CSG dashboard’s Adaptation Catalog, highlighting global best practices that can be scaled locally. In a landscape where collaboration is key to addressing climate challenges, the CSG dashboard could be a necessary tool for enhancing Kenya's resilience to climate change while promoting sustainable development through informed, data-driven strategies.
On the other hand, MPG in transformative adaptation is essential for building systemic resilience in the face of climate change, as disasters do not recognize sectoral or spatial boundaries, necessitating a holistic approach to adaptation. Effective adaptation requires improved coordination across various scales and sectors, ensuring comprehensive and contextually relevant responses (Amarnathet al., 2023). MPG facilitates this by incorporating multiple overlapping centers of decision-making that operate independently yet remain coordinated, allowing for a more flexible and responsive governance structure. This interconnectedness enables stakeholders at local, regional, and national levels to collaborate effectively, share resources, and leverage diverse expertise, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of adaptation interventions. By fostering such collaboration, MPG empowers communities to address climate challenges in a unified manner, transforming vulnerabilities into opportunities for resilience and sustainable development.
Methodology
This brief used a comprehensive desk review of tools and frameworks for transformative climate adaptation, focusing on the MPG tool guide and CSG dashboard. The desk review aimed to identify how these tools can effectively mitigate climate-related challenges and enhance adaptive capacities within various sectors, such as forest management and agriculture, in the wake of climate change. It analyzed the capabilities of CSG and MPG tools to map out the climate change issues and their sensitivity in helping to address the gaps and opportunities for improvement in Kenya's climate adaptation efforts.

The report also highlights the stakeholder perceptions regarding the roles of MPG and CSG in climate adaptation, assessed through a policy dialogue workshop held in Nairobi, Kenya. The policy dialogue, an interactive session, gathered insights from various stakeholders, including government officials, local communities, NGOs, and academic experts. The dialogues aimed to facilitate a deeper understanding of how these governance frameworks are perceived in practice and their potential impact on enhancing resilience against climate change.
Potential of MPG and CSG tools for
climate change governance
The MPG and CSG dashboard tools help address governance and planning transformative climate adaptation options. MPG facilitates a decentralized, flexible governance approach, which is vital for managing the complexities of climate change. The MPG tool facilitates effective collaboration between institutions and stakeholders by creating a framework that integrates various viewpoints, resources, and skills. Through integrating several overlapping decision-making centers, MPG guarantees that responses are thorough and contextually appropriate. For example, the tool's focus on systemic planning through governance mapping and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) enabling Kenya to align its strategies across institutional and spatial scales, addressing fragmented and overlapping initiatives that frequently impede effective climate action.
Similarly, the CSG Dashboard integrates state-of-the-art tools for real-time analytics and risk assessments to provide a state-of-the-art solution to climate governance concerns (Alahacoon & Amarnath, 2023). By acting as a central location for decision-making, this platform helps policymakers rank interventions according to precise, data-driven insights. The dashboard's geospatial tools and adaptation catalogs improve planning procedures by recognizing climate risks and possibilities at the national and sub-national levels. Its investment tracking capabilities also offer a clear way to allocate funds to adaptation projects of the utmost importance. Assuring the effective use of resources and enhancing accountability, the Dashboard provides a uniform framework for monitoring and evaluation. When combined, these resources not only help Kenya achieve its climate adaptation goals but also complement more general sustainable development goals by promoting resilience in vital sectors like agriculture, water management, forestry, and community adaptation.
Thus, the MPG and CSG tools represent a paradigm shift in climate governance. They provide the institutional frameworks and technological capabilities needed for Kenya to effectively address its vulnerabilities and leverage its opportunities. These tools are vital in fostering collaboration, promoting transparency, and enabling data-driven decision-making to achieve the ambitious targets outlined in Kenya's National Adaptation Plan and Nationally Determined Contributions.
Case Insights on application of MPG
and CSG from other regions
The case of Morocco demonstrates how Multiscale Polycentric Governance (MPG) and Transformative Adaptation Options (TAOs) can be leveraged to address climate challenges in agriculture. Morocco has successfully transitioned to high-value crops, such as olives and citrus fruits, better suited to arid and semi-arid conditions (Aleth et al., 2023). This shift was facilitated by efficient irrigation systems supported by MPG frameworks, enabling coordinated governance across multiple stakeholders, including farmers, local governments, and national policymakers. Introducing advanced irrigation techniques, such as drip irrigation, has optimized water use and improved agricultural productivity. These efforts have bolstered the resilience of agricultural systems to water scarcity and contributed to economic growth by increasing the value of agricultural exports. Morocco’s approach

o Effective integration of MPG and CSG tools will require sufficient investment.
Mobilizing financial resources through innovative adaptation finance strategies, such as green bonds and public- private partnerships, will make the funding available for implementation. Furthermore, the use of the CSG Dashboard to supervise climate adaptation projects ensures transparency and accountability. This will allow for regular monitoring and evaluation to assess progress, identify shortcomings, and ensure that adaptation actions bring tangible benefits to communities and ecosystems.
Altogether, such a course of action will potentially see Kenya emerge as one of the leading countries in climate- smart governance through using MPG and CSG tools for resilience building and ensuring sustainable development amidst climate change.
Areas for MPG and CSG Applications
in Kenya
The use of MPG and CSG tools in various sectors in Kenya can significantly enhance resilience and sustainability, thus responding adequately to the far-reaching and complex impacts of climate change. In agriculture, MPG and CSG tools can help implement climate-resilient crop varieties and solutions from natural ecosystems. Given the country’s heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture, these tools can help farmers adapt to erratic weather patterns by providing data-driven insights and fostering collaboration among stakeholders. For example, the CSG Dashboard’s geospatial capabilities can identify regions most at risk of drought or flooding, enabling targeted interventions that protect livelihoods and food security.
Water resource management is another critical area where these tools can substantially impact. Kenyan water scarcity is aggravated by population growth and climate variability. Integrating the MPG decentralized governance framework will enhance coordination among the institutions responsible for water management, while the CSG Dashboard will support early warning systems and water conservation initiatives. This can lead to the development of more resilient water management systems that ensure equitable access and minimize risks of water-related conflicts in Kenya.
In the forestry sector, MPG and CSG tools could be used to strengthen governance mechanisms for reforestation, afforestation, and conservation initiatives. Deforestation and land degradation are still under control in Kenya, creating severe vulnerabilities to climate change. MPG's focus on multi-level coordination can foster collaboration among government agencies, local communities, and private sector actors, while the CSG Dashboard monitors and tracks reforestation efforts and progress toward carbon sequestration goals. Such synergistic efforts will enhance the ecological integrity of Kenya's forest ecosystems, contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Lastly, community adaptation efforts can be greatly enhanced by these tools through the promotion of grassroots- level resilience. Through its inclusion of local stakeholders in decision-making processes, MPG ensures that adaptation strategies are contextually relevant and inclusive. The CSG Dashboard can complement these efforts by providing accessible data and resources that empower communities to take proactive measures against climate risks. In this way, the tools of MPG and CSG drive sustainable, community-centered solutions throughout Kenya's diverse landscapes.
Conclusion and Way Forward
The MPG and CSG tools represent an innovative approach toward addressing the climate challenges that Kenya faces. By facilitating institutional collaboration, stakeholder engagement, and data-informed decision processes, the

tools lay a strong foundation for building resilience in sectoral contexts. Moreover, they address the fragmentation and inefficiencies often linked with climate governance while allowing for the integration of adaptation strategies into broader sustainable development goals. The tools’ capacity to align national and subnational priorities ensures that Kenya’s climate actions are both comprehensive and contextually relevant, addressing vulnerabilities while leveraging opportunities for resilience and growth.
Moving forward, Kenya must prioritize operationalizing these tools within its existing policy frameworks. Hosting the MPG and CSG platforms in a centralized system will streamline access and ensure coherence across all levels of governance. Assigning user rights to relevant stakeholders will ensure inclusiveness and accountability, thus creating a collaborative environment for climate adaptation. In addition, holding further workshops will be important for improving policy guidelines, building up institutional capacities, and addressing any challenges that may arise during implementation. Such workshops should focus on practical aspects of tool application, including training and stakeholder consultations.
The success of these efforts will depend on continued political commitment, adequate financial resources, and continued stakeholder engagement. Through these mechanisms, Kenya can place itself among the leaders in progressive climate governance and demonstrate the tremendous transformative potential of the MPG and CSG instruments in building resilience and sustainability. As the impacts of climate change become more pronounced, these tools will help safeguard Kenya's development gains and, by extension, become a standard for other nations facing similar challenges.

Introduction
The contribution of Kenya to Green House Gas (GHG) emissions globally stands at less than 0.1 percent in 2018. On the other hand, the country's GHG emission is growing at an average rate of 4.4 percent per year between 2001 and 2019 (World Bank, 2023). With an increased emission rate, national annual emissions related to agriculture, Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF), energy, industrial processes plus product use, and waste increased from 56.9 MtCO2 eq in 1995 to 93.7 MtCO2 eq in 2015, showing an increase of 65 percent. Kenya's updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) committed to reducing GHG emissions by 32 percent by 2030 from the projected BAU of 143 MtCO2 eq in tandem with the sustainable development agenda (UNFCC, 2022).
In Kenya, the average number of hot days and nights per year has increased by approximately 15.6 percent and 31 percent, respectively, from 1960 to 2003. Increased variability in rainfall patterns with increased extreme precipitation and dry spells has also been observed. Wet areas, like the highlands, have reliable rainfall, and low plateaus and arid regions are generally dry. Over the last three decades, the average annual rainfall has been about 726 mm, with two major rainy seasons between March to May and October to December. With increased rainfall variability since the sixties, the contrast between the wetter northern regions and the drier southern regions has greatly intensified. Since the year 2000, increasing frequency and seriousness of extreme rainfall events along with lengthier arid spells across the arid areas have been observed (Detelinova, et al., 2023).
Kenya has made significant strides in implementing climate adaptation and resilience measures, particularly highlighted during the recent African Climate Change Summit in Nairobi (UNFCC, n.d). This summit emphasized the need for collaboration with international partners and the development of tools for effective monitoring and reporting on climate change issues. The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) for 2015-2030 is central to Kenya's efforts, aligning with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) guidelines and the Paris Agreement. The Kenyan government has established a robust framework that includes various national policies, such as the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2018-2022, which integrates climate considerations across all sectors of the economy. The NCCAP aims to enhance resilience to climate impacts while reducing the GHG emissions, showcasing a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change challenges. Moreover, establishing the National Climate Change Council ensures high-level political support and effective coordination of climate actions across different governmental levels.
In addition to these strategic frameworks, Kenya actively engages local communities and stakeholders to bolster its climate resilience initiatives. For instance, the Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Framework Programme is designed to enhance agricultural productivity while adapting to changing climatic conditions (United Nations, 2023). This program requires substantial capacity building and resource allocation to ensure its success in various sectors such as agriculture, livestock, and fisheries. Furthermore, Kenya's commitment to climate adaptation is evident through its participation in readiness projects with the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which has facilitated training for over 700 technical staff and journalists in climate-related planning and implementation. Although these efforts are setting a foundation for sustainable long-term climate change adaptation, there is a need for more robust tools that will help collaboration among various stakeholders for mapping and making timely decisions to avert future vulnerabilities.
Climate change is a problem that Kenya is grappling with, especially within the agricultural sector and the management of water resources, which impact food security and the economy. High levels of fragmented governance, poor access to climate applicable technologies, and poor policy making that does not incorporate local and national adaptation strategies, further compound these challenges. Even worse, smallholder farmers, who are the mainstay of the agricultural economy in Kenya, possess limited resources to adopt or implement sustainable practices or sufficiently respond to climate shocks. The ClimBeR innovations, comprising the Climate-Smart Governance (CSG) and Multiscale Polycentric Governance (MPG) tools, offer a more holistic solution to these concerns. Data collection and analysis as well as resource allocation for new strategies are included in local governance to promote climate change resilience. Using these tools, Kenya can ensure it commits to transforming its adaptation processes sustainably to reflect its Nationally Determined Contributions as well as long-term adaptation plan.

This policy brief underscores the role of CSG dashboard and MPG tool to guide in addressing Kenya’s adaptation needs for climate change impacts.
CSG and MPG tools for transformative
adaptation
The CSG dashboard and MPG tool guide, developed by International Water Management Institute through the CGIAR’s Climate Resilience initiative “ClimBeR”, are comprehensive tools that can facilitate governance in adaptation interventions under climate change. Both tools emerge as vital instruments providing frameworks that enhance multi-level coordination and transformative adaptation strategies.
The dashboard is designed to support decision-makers by integrating climate adaptation into national and subnational development planning. It emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement and institutional capacity building, which are essential for effective governance in climate adaptation. The dashboard includes comprehensive risk assessments, strategic action plans, and investment planning tools that help identify priority areas for intervention. By fostering cross-sectoral approaches, including nature-based solutions, the Dashboard aligns with Kenya’s broader climate resilience goals and supports the implementation of climate-smart strategies across various sectors.
Its monitoring and evaluation tools complement the Dashboard's functionalities, ensuring resource allocation transparency and accountability (Amarasinghe et al., 2023). These tools enable officers to map vulnerable areas, design spatially targeted adaptation options, and effectively track project progress and outcomes, thereby enhancing climate adaptation initiatives' overall impact. Integrating data analytics, geospatial tools, and climate outlooks within the dashboard provides stakeholders with critical insights for informed decision-making. Additionally, the platform facilitates shared learning through resources like the CSG dashboard’s Adaptation Catalog, highlighting global best practices that can be scaled locally. In a landscape where collaboration is key to addressing climate challenges, the CSG dashboard could be a necessary tool for enhancing Kenya's resilience to climate change while promoting sustainable development through informed, data-driven strategies.
On the other hand, MPG in transformative adaptation is essential for building systemic resilience in the face of climate change, as disasters do not recognize sectoral or spatial boundaries, necessitating a holistic approach to adaptation. Effective adaptation requires improved coordination across various scales and sectors, ensuring comprehensive and contextually relevant responses (Amarnathet al., 2023). MPG facilitates this by incorporating multiple overlapping centers of decision-making that operate independently yet remain coordinated, allowing for a more flexible and responsive governance structure. This interconnectedness enables stakeholders at local, regional, and national levels to collaborate effectively, share resources, and leverage diverse expertise, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of adaptation interventions. By fostering such collaboration, MPG empowers communities to address climate challenges in a unified manner, transforming vulnerabilities into opportunities for resilience and sustainable development.

The report also highlights the stakeholder perceptions regarding the roles of MPG and CSG in climate adaptation, assessed through a policy dialogue workshop held in Nairobi, Kenya. The policy dialogue, an interactive session, gathered insights from various stakeholders, including government officials, local communities, NGOs, and academic experts. The dialogues aimed to facilitate a deeper understanding of how these governance frameworks are perceived in practice and their potential impact on enhancing resilience against climate change.
Potential of MPG and CSG tools for
climate change governance
The MPG and CSG dashboard tools help address governance and planning transformative climate adaptation options. MPG facilitates a decentralized, flexible governance approach, which is vital for managing the complexities of climate change. The MPG tool facilitates effective collaboration between institutions and stakeholders by creating a framework that integrates various viewpoints, resources, and skills. Through integrating several overlapping decision-making centers, MPG guarantees that responses are thorough and contextually appropriate. For example, the tool's focus on systemic planning through governance mapping and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) enabling Kenya to align its strategies across institutional and spatial scales, addressing fragmented and overlapping initiatives that frequently impede effective climate action.
Similarly, the CSG Dashboard integrates state-of-the-art tools for real-time analytics and risk assessments to provide a state-of-the-art solution to climate governance concerns (Alahacoon & Amarnath, 2023). By acting as a central location for decision-making, this platform helps policymakers rank interventions according to precise, data-driven insights. The dashboard's geospatial tools and adaptation catalogs improve planning procedures by recognizing climate risks and possibilities at the national and sub-national levels. Its investment tracking capabilities also offer a clear way to allocate funds to adaptation projects of the utmost importance. Assuring the effective use of resources and enhancing accountability, the Dashboard provides a uniform framework for monitoring and evaluation. When combined, these resources not only help Kenya achieve its climate adaptation goals but also complement more general sustainable development goals by promoting resilience in vital sectors like agriculture, water management, forestry, and community adaptation.
Thus, the MPG and CSG tools represent a paradigm shift in climate governance. They provide the institutional frameworks and technological capabilities needed for Kenya to effectively address its vulnerabilities and leverage its opportunities. These tools are vital in fostering collaboration, promoting transparency, and enabling data-driven decision-making to achieve the ambitious targets outlined in Kenya's National Adaptation Plan and Nationally Determined Contributions.
Case Insights on application of MPG
and CSG from other regions
The case of Morocco demonstrates how Multiscale Polycentric Governance (MPG) and Transformative Adaptation Options (TAOs) can be leveraged to address climate challenges in agriculture. Morocco has successfully transitioned to high-value crops, such as olives and citrus fruits, better suited to arid and semi-arid conditions (Aleth et al., 2023). This shift was facilitated by efficient irrigation systems supported by MPG frameworks, enabling coordinated governance across multiple stakeholders, including farmers, local governments, and national policymakers. Introducing advanced irrigation techniques, such as drip irrigation, has optimized water use and improved agricultural productivity. These efforts have bolstered the resilience of agricultural systems to water scarcity and contributed to economic growth by increasing the value of agricultural exports. Morocco’s approach

in Kenya
The use of MPG and CSG tools in various sectors in Kenya can significantly enhance resilience and sustainability, thus responding adequately to the far-reaching and complex impacts of climate change. In agriculture, MPG and CSG tools can help implement climate-resilient crop varieties and solutions from natural ecosystems. Given the country’s heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture, these tools can help farmers adapt to erratic weather patterns by providing data-driven insights and fostering collaboration among stakeholders. For example, the CSG Dashboard’s geospatial capabilities can identify regions most at risk of drought or flooding, enabling targeted interventions that protect livelihoods and food security.
Water resource management is another critical area where these tools can substantially impact. Kenyan water scarcity is aggravated by population growth and climate variability. Integrating the MPG decentralized governance framework will enhance coordination among the institutions responsible for water management, while the CSG Dashboard will support early warning systems and water conservation initiatives. This can lead to the development of more resilient water management systems that ensure equitable access and minimize risks of water-related conflicts in Kenya.
In the forestry sector, MPG and CSG tools could be used to strengthen governance mechanisms for reforestation, afforestation, and conservation initiatives. Deforestation and land degradation are still under control in Kenya, creating severe vulnerabilities to climate change. MPG's focus on multi-level coordination can foster collaboration among government agencies, local communities, and private sector actors, while the CSG Dashboard monitors and tracks reforestation efforts and progress toward carbon sequestration goals. Such synergistic efforts will enhance the ecological integrity of Kenya's forest ecosystems, contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Lastly, community adaptation efforts can be greatly enhanced by these tools through the promotion of grassroots- level resilience. Through its inclusion of local stakeholders in decision-making processes, MPG ensures that adaptation strategies are contextually relevant and inclusive. The CSG Dashboard can complement these efforts by providing accessible data and resources that empower communities to take proactive measures against climate risks. In this way, the tools of MPG and CSG drive sustainable, community-centered solutions throughout Kenya's diverse landscapes.
Conclusion and Way Forward
The MPG and CSG tools represent an innovative approach toward addressing the climate challenges that Kenya faces. By facilitating institutional collaboration, stakeholder engagement, and data-informed decision processes, the

Executive Summary
Zambia has experienced drought recently. Droughts have caused severe impacts on people’s livelihoods, the environment and the economy. For instance, low rainfall threatens most of Zambia, particularly the Southern Province, as observed during the 2023/2024 farming season, which affected agricultural productivity, crop failure and food scarcity. There has also been reduced water in most of the streams, rivers, and groundwater sources, which either dried up or operated at critically low levels. This rendered it difficult to access clean water for drinking, domestic purposes, irrigation, and livestock.
In 2023, the ACTION Grant Program, in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the District Council, supported the development of a solar-powered borehole in Hanzila, Southern Zambia to enhance resilience to climate change impacts. This innovative work aimed at illustrating how the community-led construction of water

infrastructures in rural contexts can mitigate the effects of climate change, for instance, droughts, by providing segmented water availability for domestic purposes, livestock, and agriculture.
The assessment of the livelihood outcomes began by establishing how the solar-powered borehole installed has improved access to an adequate water supply to enhance climate change adaptive measures and resilience among the Hanzila community after its installation. The assessment was done to determine the extent to which it has met its developmental objectives of reducing the effects of climate change by sustainably increasing the community’s resilience.
Sampling for the evaluation included participants for qualitative interviews and quantitative interviews. For quantitative interviews, a sample of forty households of persons aged 18 and above who resided in Hanzila were drawn from the community. Almost equal numbers of males and females were selected. Further, all research participants represented people accessing various water needs, including drinking water and other domestic uses, livestock watering, and irrigation. Further, in this study, participants for the Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) were purposively sampled. Purposive sampling was used to select research participants who had knowledge about the implementation of the borehole, either technically or through community conversations. The sampling strategy also aimed at ensuring that different age groups, both sexes and with regard to occupation, i.e., livestock keeping or crop farming, participated in the focused group discussion. The discussion focused more on the responsibilities of women and men in managing water at the household level and women and men engaged in livestock and crop farming.
Further, the sample comprised the water committee and the leaders of the community. Research participants also provided details of the usage of the borehole, difficulties encountered, and perceived effects on drinking, watering of livestock, and crop irrigation. The water committee provided insights into borehole maintenance, operation, and measures to ensure water supply reliability.
With regards to the pre-implementation of the solar-powered borehole as the baseline for the outcome assessment, the people of Hanzila used different sources of water, including hand pumps, hand-dug wells, rivers and streams, scoop holes and rainwater. They were multipurpose utilisations involving uses such as drinking, cooking, cleaning, washing, watering livestock, and irrigation. However, due to the growing demand, they congested the only source of water, a borehole with a hand pump that supplied water for drinking, domestic work, and livestock. This resulted in long hours being spent waiting to access water. Some households avoided waiting long hours trying to access water for drinking and ended up using unclean sources to access water for drinking. The study found that 20% of the respondents indicated having used water from sources such as streams and scoop holes for drinking and other uses in the home to avoid spending long hours at the borehole waiting their turn to get water. Such sources endangered people’s health by exposing them to waterborne illnesses. Regarding open sources for drinking and/or other domestic uses, none of the respondents indicated that they used the source after the solar-powered borehole was installed. The solar-powered borehole had clean water which has helped people access safer water and also has reduced their chances of contracting waterborne diseases. It has also reduced the time taken for people to access water because the community has 10 taps distributed in various locations within the village, and this allows people to access water simultaneously without having to face the hardship of queuing for access.
Before the implementation of the borehole, 63% of the respondents indicated that they used water sources more than 500 meters away, as opposed to only 13% that indicated using water that is 500 meters away. In addition, the number of households that started practising gardening activities has increased since the implementation of the solar-powered borehole. Before the solar-powered borehole was done, only 23% of the male and female respondents had their own gardens for crop and gardening activities, whereas 77 did not have gardens. The proportion of respondents with gardens and those doing gardening activities has increased from 23% to 69% since the implementation of the borehole. This illustrates that once the solar-powered borehole was installed in Hanzila, farmers could get water all year round, which promoted farming. It also helped them practice crop diversification, where they grew crops like maize, tomatoes, cabbage, kale, sweet bananas, onions, chillies, and Chinese cabbage. On the other hand, 31% of the household respondents indicated they do not have gardens.
In addition to the mere provision of food production, the gardens now cater for economic needs, whereby farmers take their produce to Monze town markets to earn some income for their families. For each day that their produce is taken for sale, farmers earn on average ZMW250 (USD10) to ZMW1,000 (USD40). This has helped to enhance financial stability and helps people to have funds to purchase food not readily grown within the village to enable

families to afford balanced meals for healthy growth and development of children. Also, the revenue derived from the sale of these crops is channelled into other income-producing ventures within the community, including small- scale marketing of other household necessities.
Generally, livestock management has improved since the installation of the solar borehole. Firstly, the percentage of people who use distant streams and rivers for cattle watering has gone down from 52% pre-solar borehole implementation to 20% post-solar borehole implementation. About 48% of the respondents did not own any cattle. Farmers take their cattle to water points supplied by the borehole, where watering is done using large basins.
Despite the many benefits seen after installing the solar-powered borehole, some challenges persist. For example, households that did not live near the laid-out pipes and taps still had to travel a longer distance to access water. For others, they had to pay extra funds to extend the supply lines to their homestead for an infrastructure that was provided to the community free of charge. While extending supply lines availed households that were situated further from the water access points, it also meant that they needed to pay something to access what the community got freely. There were still households that could not afford to extend supply lines closer to the homestead. Such households still had to walk far to the new taps and hardly benefitted from reduced distance to access water, which was one of the challenges the solar-powered borehole was trying to address in the Hanzila community.
There are also challenges concerning agricultural-related activities that support crop irrigation in the gardens. One of the pertinent issues concerns the lack of conveyance, such as pipes to water to fields. About 40% of the respondents indicated that the lack of supply lines to convey water into their fields posed a constraint. People had to physically carry water using buckets from taps in the field, which was labour-intensive. On the other hand, 29% did not highlight the lack of conveyance as a challenge, and 31% did not have gardens.
The installation of the solar-powered borehole in Hanzila represents a significant technological advancement for the community, introducing new challenges alongside its benefits. Unlike the familiar hand pumps maintained by community-appointed pump minders, the solar-powered system requires specialised knowledge and skills for operation and maintenance. Community members lack the expertise in maintaining and repairing its components, which differ significantly from traditional pumps. This is a source of concern regarding the borehole's general sustenance.
Despite a few challenges noted from the Hanzila solar-powered borehole, the borehole presents best practices for replication in other communities to enhance access to water for multiple uses in remote communities such as the Hanzila village. The impact of the solar-powered borehole on community development, particularly in providing a reliable water source for crop production, for example, shows that people can be food secure even when facing droughts and the impacts of climate change. People can now grow crops that provide them with good nutrition and create income from the sales.
Community engagement from the onset of the project is critical. In the six-steps participatory process followed, community members provided insights into the actual problems they face and how solutions such as the solar- powered borehole can help alleviate some of the problems. Involving community members in community initiatives such as the solar-powered borehole also helped to instil ownership of the infrastructure, as evidenced by the measures put in place to safeguard it, such as shifting the control box used to operate the borehole to one of the water committee members’ houses for safety.

1. Introduction
Enhancing Community Climate Resilience through Water Infrastructural Development
Global repercussions of climate change have continued to manifest throughout the world. There is information on seasons of drought existence, periods of flooding and higher temperatures characterised by wide occurrence and severity (Nicholls et al. 2012; Seneviratne et al. 2021). Global warming is caused by climate change, which affects both the structure of natural systems and human societies. Climate change causes changes in the regimes of various regions, creating more disasters such as droughts, high temperatures and floods, which are becoming increasingly frequent (Mukheibir and Ziervogel 2007, IPCC 2021). These events cause extreme hardship and even death, especially for the most affected groups (IPCC 2014). Low-income rural people face the effects of climate change most severely. Still, they have a very small capacity to adjust, primarily owing to the limited amount of money to adapt to climate change (IPCC 2014, World Bank 2013). Significant droughts lessen people’s ability to grow crops to sustain and support a livelihood leading to poverty that compels people to migrate. Farmers, pastoralists and rural households who practice rain-fed farming are at a greater risk because of rainfall dependency, which increases the effects of drought (FAO 2016, World Bank 2013). As lack of water worsens during drought conditions, the availability of safe and clean drinking water, toilets or latrines, and hygienic practices are also severely affected, increasing the health risks among the already vulnerable populations, in particular women and children (UNICEF and WHO, 2019).
The challenges faced in this context require both immediate response measures during the climate emergency and long-term measures to improve resilience and maximise adaptability to the situation at hand.Community-based initiatives, including the establishment of solar-powered boreholes as sustainable water source development, can be helpful in averting the problems of climate-induced water shortage. These technologies enable the population to access water and eliminate the need to rely on erratic rainfall, thus increasing the community's ability to adapt to climate change.
Increased efficiency of water management practices is vital in increasing climate resilience in rural areas as it provides for the economy, sustains ecosystems and makes communities less vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, including droughts, floods and extreme weather events (GIZ 2023). The vulnerability of water resources and a significant challenge for all skilled forward-looking residents carries the focus in the expansive water management strategy for radical change highlighted even by global committees including United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) 27 (CRFS Alliance 2022).
Most regions in the Southern African countries, Zambia included, have been experiencing persistent droughts. Droughts have impacted the availability of water resources to meet people’s water needs. Yet, having adequate access to water resources is a lifeline for people, particularly in rural communities where water is needed for drinking and other domestic purposes, as well as water required for crop and livestock watering during dry seasons (GIZ 2023). Having regular water supplies enables farmers to keep their crops and livestock thriving during drought periods, which in turn reduces people’s susceptibility to food shortages. In addition, adequate moisture in fields through water harvesting or drip irrigation and the practice of agroforestry enable rural people to adapt to new climatic situations and use water in a more efficient manner (Ray and Majumder 2024).
Yet, countries like Zambia continue to experience reduced availability of water over time mainly for drinking, other domestic uses, animals, hygiene and sanitation, agriculture, construction, and other commercial purposes (Delia 2022, Patel et al. 2015, WHO-UNICEF 2015). These challenges affect the rural population more because of the limited availability of water infrastructure needed to access water for multiple uses. As a result, rural communities would resort to accessing water from open scoop holes and streams despite such sources being unclean and may pose health risks to water users (Mweemba et al. 2023a).
However, the geology and landscape of some rural parts also contribute to this list's many problems. Some communities are located in areas that are pretty distant from the primary water supply sources. This means people in such locations must cover long distances to access water. Covering long distances takes time that could have been allocated to other livelihood activities. In addition, it also requires a lot of energy from people to carry heavy

loads of water from distant sources. As a result, the amount of water that can be transported back home is significantly reduced due to the time and energy factor (Mweemba et al. 2023b).
Performing the task of getting water for domestic use is even more difficult in areas with an environment that has some physical characteristics, such as hilly terrain. In many communities, it is common to find women and children, particularly the young ones, who are forced to carry water over long distances, sometimes balancing the water on their heads to ensure that there is sufficient water for use in different activities, including drinking. Also, men have to go long distances to fetch water, mainly for livestock and, at times, for agriculture. The impacts of climate change aid these circumstances. Recent vulnerabilities of agriculture are characterised by increased casualties of climate change in terms of temperature and decreased production of rainfall (Jain 2007, Thurlow et al. 2009).
The southern part of Zambia has also undergone changes in average annual rainfall (Jain 2007). Moreover, temperature increases have contributed to increased water loss in the region, which heightens the water challenge. As a consequence, there has been increased competition for limited water resources.
Reduced rainfall affects most small-scale farmers who depend on rainfall for agriculture. The intensity and recurrence of drought and drying conditions have made agricultural productivity even more difficult to sustain (IAPRI 2021). For example, the 2023/2024 farming season caused severe losses in crops due to inadequate amounts of rainfall. The drought also affected the standard water availability, whereby most of the streams, rivers and groundwater sources became dry, and others reached their lowest record. This impacted negatively on the ability of people to gain access to clean water for drinking, domestic purposes, food preparation, and the support of agriculture and livestock. This is even more so since vulnerable groups are affected, especially the rural population, who would experience even less access to water.
Addressing these challenges requires an integrated approach, which involves various measures. For example, it may include the development of water infrastructure with the participation of the communities for which such infrastructure is intended. It may also include investing in rainwater harvesting mechanisms to enhance water availability for irrigation. Constructing infrastructure for different purposes, including drinking, domestic purposes, livestock watering, and small-scale irrigation, is essential in building resilience to various challenges related to inadequate access to water at the community level (Mweemba et al. 2023b, OECD 2018, World Bank 2020). In addition, having adequate water storage and distribution channels provides opportunities to have sustained water supply even during drought instances. In addition, having sustainable water and adapting to the impacts of climate change are also important issues that can sustain people’s livelihoods. For example, having water to irrigate crops during periods of droughts or during dry periods of the year can contribute to improving people’s general well- being through enhanced food (IWMI 2022).
As the impacts of climate change intensify and increase people’s vulnerabilities, it is important to include approaches within activities intended to reduce the impacts of climate change in community programmes. Addressing the negative impacts on water resources, for example, communities can be supported with the right tools and knowledge to sustain their water resources. Moreover, ensuring that rural communities have adequ","Evaluating the livelihood outcomes of the solar-powered water system on drought resilience in Hanzila Village, Southern Zambia  The following text section comes from a specific evidence file named URL https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169204: ""Evaluating the livelihood outcomes of the solar-powered water system on drought resilience in Hanzila Village, Southern Zambia Skip to main content Communities & Collections Browse Navigate CGIAR Centers Statistics English Catal e tina Deutsch Espa ol Fran ais G idhlig Italiano Latvie u Magyar Nederlands Polski Portugu s Portugu s do Brasil Srpski (lat) Suomi Svenska T rk e Ti ng Vi t Y Log In Note: CGIAR users should log in with their Active Directory username and password.

Executive Summary
Zambia has experienced drought recently. Droughts have caused severe impacts on people’s livelihoods, the environment and the economy. For instance, low rainfall threatens most of Zambia, particularly the Southern Province, as observed during the 2023/2024 farming season, which affected agricultural productivity, crop failure and food scarcity. There has also been reduced water in most of the streams, rivers, and groundwater sources, which either dried up or operated at critically low levels. This rendered it difficult to access clean water for drinking, domestic purposes, irrigation, and livestock.
In 2023, the ACTION Grant Program, in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the District Council, supported the development of a solar-powered borehole in Hanzila, Southern Zambia to enhance resilience to climate change impacts. This innovative work aimed at illustrating how the community-led construction of water

infrastructures in rural contexts can mitigate the effects of climate change, for instance, droughts, by providing segmented water availability for domestic purposes, livestock, and agriculture.
The assessment of the livelihood outcomes began by establishing how the solar-powered borehole installed has improved access to an adequate water supply to enhance climate change adaptive measures and resilience among the Hanzila community after its installation. The assessment was done to determine the extent to which it has met its developmental objectives of reducing the effects of climate change by sustainably increasing the community’s resilience.
Sampling for the evaluation included participants for qualitative interviews and quantitative interviews. For quantitative interviews, a sample of forty households of persons aged 18 and above who resided in Hanzila were drawn from the community. Almost equal numbers of males and females were selected. Further, all research participants represented people accessing various water needs, including drinking water and other domestic uses, livestock watering, and irrigation. Further, in this study, participants for the Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) were purposively sampled. Purposive sampling was used to select research participants who had knowledge about the implementation of the borehole, either technically or through community conversations. The sampling strategy also aimed at ensuring that different age groups, both sexes and with regard to occupation, i.e., livestock keeping or crop farming, participated in the focused group discussion. The discussion focused more on the responsibilities of women and men in managing water at the household level and women and men engaged in livestock and crop farming.
Further, the sample comprised the water committee and the leaders of the community. Research participants also provided details of the usage of the borehole, difficulties encountered, and perceived effects on drinking, watering of livestock, and crop irrigation. The water committee provided insights into borehole maintenance, operation, and measures to ensure water supply reliability.
With regards to the pre-implementation of the solar-powered borehole as the baseline for the outcome assessment, the people of Hanzila used different sources of water, including hand pumps, hand-dug wells, rivers and streams, scoop holes and rainwater. They were multipurpose utilisations involving uses such as drinking, cooking, cleaning, washing, watering livestock, and irrigation. However, due to the growing demand, they congested the only source of water, a borehole with a hand pump that supplied water for drinking, domestic work, and livestock. This resulted in long hours being spent waiting to access water. Some households avoided waiting long hours trying to access water for drinking and ended up using unclean sources to access water for drinking. The study found that 20% of the respondents indicated having used water from sources such as streams and scoop holes for drinking and other uses in the home to avoid spending long hours at the borehole waiting their turn to get water. Such sources endangered people’s health by exposing them to waterborne illnesses. Regarding open sources for drinking and/or other domestic uses, none of the respondents indicated that they used the source after the solar-powered borehole was installed. The solar-powered borehole had clean water which has helped people access safer water and also has reduced their chances of contracting waterborne diseases. It has also reduced the time taken for people to access water because the community has 10 taps distributed in various locations within the village, and this allows people to access water simultaneously without having to face the hardship of queuing for access.
Before the implementation of the borehole, 63% of the respondents indicated that they used water sources more than 500 meters away, as opposed to only 13% that indicated using water that is 500 meters away. In addition, the number of households that started practising gardening activities has increased since the implementation of the solar-powered borehole. Before the solar-powered borehole was done, only 23% of the male and female respondents had their own gardens for crop and gardening activities, whereas 77 did not have gardens. The proportion of respondents with gardens and those doing gardening activities has increased from 23% to 69% since the implementation of the borehole. This illustrates that once the solar-powered borehole was installed in Hanzila, farmers could get water all year round, which promoted farming. It also helped them practice crop diversification, where they grew crops like maize, tomatoes, cabbage, kale, sweet bananas, onions, chillies, and Chinese cabbage. On the other hand, 31% of the household respondents indicated they do not have gardens.
In addition to the mere provision of food production, the gardens now cater for economic needs, whereby farmers take their produce to Monze town markets to earn some income for their families. For each day that their produce is taken for sale, farmers earn on average ZMW250 (USD10) to ZMW1,000 (USD40). This has helped to enhance financial stability and helps people to have funds to purchase food not readily grown within the village to enable

families to afford balanced meals for healthy growth and development of children. Also, the revenue derived from the sale of these crops is channelled into other income-producing ventures within the community, including small- scale marketing of other household necessities.
Generally, livestock management has improved since the installation of the solar borehole. Firstly, the percentage of people who use distant streams and rivers for cattle watering has gone down from 52% pre-solar borehole implementation to 20% post-solar borehole implementation. About 48% of the respondents did not own any cattle. Farmers take their cattle to water points supplied by the borehole, where watering is done using large basins.
Despite the many benefits seen after installing the solar-powered borehole, some challenges persist. For example, households that did not live near the laid-out pipes and taps still had to travel a longer distance to access water. For others, they had to pay extra funds to extend the supply lines to their homestead for an infrastructure that was provided to the community free of charge. While extending supply lines availed households that were situated further from the water access points, it also meant that they needed to pay something to access what the community got freely. There were still households that could not afford to extend supply lines closer to the homestead. Such households still had to walk far to the new taps and hardly benefitted from reduced distance to access water, which was one of the challenges the solar-powered borehole was trying to address in the Hanzila community.
There are also challenges concerning agricultural-related activities that support crop irrigation in the gardens. One of the pertinent issues concerns the lack of conveyance, such as pipes to water to fields. About 40% of the respondents indicated that the lack of supply lines to convey water into their fields posed a constraint. People had to physically carry water using buckets from taps in the field, which was labour-intensive. On the other hand, 29% did not highlight the lack of conveyance as a challenge, and 31% did not have gardens.
The installation of the solar-powered borehole in Hanzila represents a significant technological advancement for the community, introducing new challenges alongside its benefits. Unlike the familiar hand pumps maintained by community-appointed pump minders, the solar-powered system requires specialised knowledge and skills for operation and maintenance. Community members lack the expertise in maintaining and repairing its components, which differ significantly from traditional pumps. This is a source of concern regarding the borehole's general sustenance.
Despite a few challenges noted from the Hanzila solar-powered borehole, the borehole presents best practices for replication in other communities to enhance access to water for multiple uses in remote communities such as the Hanzila village. The impact of the solar-powered borehole on community development, particularly in providing a reliable water source for crop production, for example, shows that people can be food secure even when facing droughts and the impacts of climate change. People can now grow crops that provide them with good nutrition and create income from the sales.
Community engagement from the onset of the project is critical. In the six-steps participatory process followed, community members provided insights into the actual problems they face and how solutions such as the solar- powered borehole can help alleviate some of the problems. Involving community members in community initiatives such as the solar-powered borehole also helped to instil ownership of the infrastructure, as evidenced by the measures put in place to safeguard it, such as shifting the control box used to operate the borehole to one of the water committee members’ houses for safety.

1. Introduction
Enhancing Community Climate Resilience through Water Infrastructural Development
Global repercussions of climate change have continued to manifest throughout the world. There is information on seasons of drought existence, periods of flooding and higher temperatures characterised by wide occurrence and severity (Nicholls et al. 2012; Seneviratne et al. 2021). Global warming is caused by climate change, which affects both the structure of natural systems and human societies. Climate change causes changes in the regimes of various regions, creating more disasters such as droughts, high temperatures and floods, which are becoming increasingly frequent (Mukheibir and Ziervogel 2007, IPCC 2021). These events cause extreme hardship and even death, especially for the most affected groups (IPCC 2014). Low-income rural people face the effects of climate change most severely. Still, they have a very small capacity to adjust, primarily owing to the limited amount of money to adapt to climate change (IPCC 2014, World Bank 2013). Significant droughts lessen people’s ability to grow crops to sustain and support a livelihood leading to poverty that compels people to migrate. Farmers, pastoralists and rural households who practice rain-fed farming are at a greater risk because of rainfall dependency, which increases the effects of drought (FAO 2016, World Bank 2013). As lack of water worsens during drought conditions, the availability of safe and clean drinking water, toilets or latrines, and hygienic practices are also severely affected, increasing the health risks among the already vulnerable populations, in particular women and children (UNICEF and WHO, 2019).
The challenges faced in this context require both immediate response measures during the climate emergency and long-term measures to improve resilience and maximise adaptability to the situation at hand.Community-based initiatives, including the establishment of solar-powered boreholes as sustainable water source development, can be helpful in averting the problems of climate-induced water shortage. These technologies enable the population to access water and eliminate the need to rely on erratic rainfall, thus increasing the community's ability to adapt to climate change.
Increased efficiency of water management practices is vital in increasing climate resilience in rural areas as it provides for the economy, sustains ecosystems and makes communities less vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, including droughts, floods and extreme weather events (GIZ 2023). The vulnerability of water resources and a significant challenge for all skilled forward-looking residents carries the focus in the expansive water management strategy for radical change highlighted even by global committees including United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) 27 (CRFS Alliance 2022).
Most regions in the Southern African countries, Zambia included, have been experiencing persistent droughts. Droughts have impacted the availability of water resources to meet people’s water needs. Yet, having adequate access to water resources is a lifeline for people, particularly in rural communities where water is needed for drinking and other domestic purposes, as well as water required for crop and livestock watering during dry seasons (GIZ 2023). Having regular water supplies enables farmers to keep their crops and livestock thriving during drought periods, which in turn reduces people’s susceptibility to food shortages. In addition, adequate moisture in fields through water harvesting or drip irrigation and the practice of agroforestry enable rural people to adapt to new climatic situations and use water in a more efficient manner (Ray and Majumder 2024).
Yet, countries like Zambia continue to experience reduced availability of water over time mainly for drinking, other domestic uses, animals, hygiene and sanitation, agriculture, construction, and other commercial purposes (Delia 2022, Patel et al. 2015, WHO-UNICEF 2015). These challenges affect the rural population more because of the limited availability of water infrastructure needed to access water for multiple uses. As a result, rural communities would resort to accessing water from open scoop holes and streams despite such sources being unclean and may pose health risks to water users (Mweemba et al. 2023a).
However, the geology and landscape of some rural parts also contribute to this list's many problems. Some communities are located in areas that are pretty distant from the primary water supply sources. This means people in such locations must cover long distances to access water. Covering long distances takes time that could have been allocated to other livelihood activities. In addition, it also requires a lot of energy from people to carry heavy

loads of water from distant sources. As a result, the amount of water that can be transported back home is significantly reduced due to the time and energy factor (Mweemba et al. 2023b).
Performing the task of getting water for domestic use is even more difficult in areas with an environment that has some physical characteristics, such as hilly terrain. In many communities, it is common to find women and children, particularly the young ones, who are forced to carry water over long distances, sometimes balancing the water on their heads to ensure that there is sufficient water for use in different activities, including drinking. Also, men have to go long distances to fetch water, mainly for livestock and, at times, for agriculture. The impacts of climate change aid these circumstances. Recent vulnerabilities of agriculture are characterised by increased casualties of climate change in terms of temperature and decreased production of rainfall (Jain 2007, Thurlow et al. 2009).
The southern part of Zambia has also undergone changes in average annual rainfall (Jain 2007). Moreover, temperature increases have contributed to increased water loss in the region, which heightens the water challenge. As a consequence, there has been increased competition for limited water resources.
Reduced rainfall affects most small-scale farmers who depend on rainfall for agriculture. The intensity and recurrence of drought and drying conditions have made agricultural productivity even more difficult to sustain (IAPRI 2021). For example, the 2023/2024 farming season caused severe losses in crops due to inadequate amounts of rainfall. The drought also affected the standard water availability, whereby most of the streams, rivers and groundwater sources became dry, and others reached their lowest record. This impacted negatively on the ability of people to gain access to clean water for drinking, domestic purposes, food preparation, and the support of agriculture and livestock. This is even more so since vulnerable groups are affected, especially the rural population, who would experience even less access to water.
Addressing these challenges requires an integrated approach, which involves various measures. For example, it may include the development of water infrastructure with the participation of the communities for which such infrastructure is intended. It may also include investing in rainwater harvesting mechanisms to enhance water availability for irrigation. Constructing infrastructure for different purposes, including drinking, domestic purposes, livestock watering, and small-scale irrigation, is essential in building resilience to various challenges related to inadequate access to water at the community level (Mweemba et al. 2023b, OECD 2018, World Bank 2020). In addition, having adequate water storage and distribution channels provides opportunities to have sustained water supply even during drought instances. In addition, having sustainable water and adapting to the impacts of climate change are also important issues that can sustain people’s livelihoods. For example, having water to irrigate crops during periods of droughts or during dry periods of the year can contribute to improving people’s general well- being through enhanced food (IWMI 2022).
As the impacts of climate change intensify and increase people’s vulnerabilities, it is important to include approaches within activities intended to reduce the impacts of climate change in community programmes. Addressing the negative impacts on water resources, for example, communities can be supported with the right tools and knowledge to sustain their water resources. Moreover, ensuring that rural communities have adequ"

1. INTRODUCCIÓN
1.1 Antecedentes
La Iniciativa CGIAR ""Agroecología para Transformar los Sistemas Alimentarios"" fue concebida dentro de la Plataforma de Asociación Transformativa en Agroecología (TPP, por sus siglas en inglés), lanzada en año 2021, para fomentar la transición hacia sistemas agrícolas y alimentarios más sostenibles y, por lo tanto, contribuir a medios de vida y paisajes resilientes a diversas escalas, contextos y ubicaciones. A través de un enfoque colaborativo y transdisciplinario que involucra a una diversidad de actores, desde el nivel local hasta el nacional, la Iniciativa ha buscado abordar las principales brechas de conocimiento y los obstáculos de implementación que hasta ahora han impedido la adopción generalizada de la agroecología para la sostenibilidad de los sistemas alimentarios. Para ello, se viene trabajando a nivel de territorios denominados ""Paisajes Vivos Agroecológicos"" (ALL, por sus siglas en inglés) en ocho países: Burkina Faso, India, Kenia, Laos, Perú, Senegal, Túnez y Zimbabwe, reuniendo a agricultores y sus asociaciones, comunidades indígenas, investigadores de múltiples disciplinas, empresas del sector privado, organizaciones no gubernamentales y responsables de la formulación de políticas. Con la visión de contribuir a las transiciones agroecológicas a través de una investigación aplicada, se desarrollaron cinco paquetes de trabajo (WP, por sus siglas en inglés) diseñados para interactuar y complementarse entre sí. Dos de ellos, los Paquetes de Trabajo 2 y 5, se centraron en generar evidencia científica que pueda servir para guiar la futura aplicación de los enfoques agroecológicos; los Paquetes de Trabajo 3 y 4 abordaron estrategias de escalamiento adaptativo en dos frentes: la integración de la agroecología en los modelos de negocio y las cadenas de valor, y el fortalecimiento del entorno político e institucional para permitir las transiciones agroecológicas a escala; y el Paquete de Trabajo 1 cumplió dos funciones clave: articular todos los paquetes de trabajo a través de una Teoría de Cambio que delineara las acciones necesarias para catalizar una transición agroecológica en cada territorio, y probar innovaciones locales a nivel de campo y finca de manera pragmática. La Figura 1 proporciona una visión general de la interrelación y los resultados esperados de los cinco paquetes de trabajo en los ALL, y la Figura 2 ilustra sus interacciones específicamente en el ALL de Perú.

Figura 2. Interacciones de los paquetes de trabajo en el ALL de Perú
En el caso específico del Paquete de Trabajo 2, éste tuvo como propósito la generación de evidencia científica sobre la eficacia del enfoque agroecológico para proporcionar sistemas alimentarios sostenibles. Para ello, se desarrolló y pilotó la herramienta Evaluación Holística de Desempeño Agroecológico Localizado (Holistic Localized Agroecology Performance Assessment o HOLPA, por sus siglas en inglés) en una diversidad de contextos biofísicos y socioculturales. Dicha herramienta integró los 13 principios agroecológicos establecidos en el 2019 por el Panel de Alto Nivel de Expertos en Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición de la FAO (HLPE, por sus siglas en inglés), así como una serie de indicadores de carácter agronómico, medioambiental, económico y social. En Perú, la aplicación de HOLPA se llevó a cabo en el corredor agroforestal Pucallpa - Aguaytía, ubicado en la región amazónica de Ucayali. En la siguiente sección, se proporcionará una descripción del ALL para Perú, el cual fue elegido a través de un proceso de consulta con actores locales y regionales.
1.2 Contexto de la Iniciativa en Agroecología en Perú
Características y relevancia del ALL-Perú
El ALL de Perú se encuentra en la región amazónica del departamento de Ucayali, que comparte frontera con Brasil. Ucayali está compuesta por cuatro provincias: Coronel Portillo, Atalaya, Padre Abad y Purús, con una población total estimada de 589,110 habitantes (INEI, 2020). Con una extensión de 102 399.94 km 2, es la segunda región más grande del Perú y, con una densidad de 4.95 habitantes/km2, es también la tercera menos poblada (INEI, 2017a). Esta región cálida y húmeda tiene una temperatura promedio de 26°C y registra precipitaciones de hasta 4500 mm de lluvia por año (Centro de Conservación, Investigación y Manejo de Áreas Naturales [CIMA], 2017). Alberga una vasta red fluvial, teniendo como a uno de sus principales afluentes al río Aguaytía, que cruza todo el territorio que comprende el ALL. Este recurso hídrico es utilizado por los diferentes sectores (población, industria, agricultura y acuicultura), siendo el sector agrícola el que consume la mayor proporción (94%) (Autoridad Nacional del Agua [ANA], 2022)
La actividad económica de Ucayali se concentra, principalmente, en las provincias de Coronel Portillo y Padre Abad, donde vive el 89% de la población (INEI, 2020). En estas mismas provincias se encuentra ubicado el ALL de Perú. Específicamente, el ALL comprende toda la provincia de Padre Abad, los distritos de Nueva Requena, Campo Verde, Manantay y Yarinacocha de la provincia de Coronel Portillo, y la capital de Ucayali, Pucallpa. El ALL tiene un área de 14,064.11 km 2 y coincide con lo que el Gobierno Regional de Ucayali (GOREU) ha identificado como el corredor agroforestal Pucallpa-Aguaytía, también conocido como la cuenca del Aguaytía (Figura 3).

Figura 3. Ubicación del ALL en la región de Ucayali, Perú.
El corredor agroforestal Pucallpa – Aguaytía (donde se ubica el ALL), fue priorizado por el GOREU como parte de un ambicioso plan de desarrollo sostenible: la Estrategia Regional de Desarrollo Rural de Baja Emisión en la Región de Ucayali al 2030 (ERDRBE Ucayali 2030)1. Esta Estrategia Regional tiene como objetivo reducir la deforestación y mejorar la calidad de vida de la población de la región, con énfasis en las zonas rurales y las comunidades indígenas, buscando la sostenibilidad, la inclusión social y la competitividad económica de la región de Ucayali. Siendo el ALL un territorio que registra la tasa de deforestación más alta de Ucayali en las últimas dos décadas, con el 40% de sus bosques perdidos debido a la expansión de la frontera agrícola y la construcción de infraestructura, el GRU busca fomentar el desarrollo de actividades alternativas que sean económica y ambientalmente sostenibles, a la vez que contribuyan a la resiliencia al cambio climático (GOREU, 2020; MINAM, 2021).
Actualmente las actividades agrícolas que predominan en el ALL se basan en el monocultivo de palma de aceite, cacao, plátano, café, arroz, yuca y pastos para la ganadería, con implicaciones perjudiciales en términos de pérdida de biodiversidad, empobrecimiento del suelo y la fragmentación de los bosques que albergan una alta diversidad de especies y valiosos servicios ecosistémicos. Ante estas crecientes presiones, pero también su alto potencial forestal, acuícola y turístico, la presencia de ONG y organizaciones de agricultores alineadas con el enfoque agroecológico, y una política pública (ERDRBE Ucayali 2030) que apoya la visión agroecológica, el ALL constituyó el territorio propicio para el desarrollo de actividades de investigación y desarrollo como parte de la Iniciativa Agroecológica (IA).
Sistemas productivos y principales socios
Dado su relevancia socioeconómica y ambiental en la región de Ucayali, los sistemas de producción de cacao (Theobroma cacao) fueron el punto de entrada de las actividades de la Iniciativa de Agroecología en el ALL de Perú. Alrededor del 34% de los productores de Ucayali cultivan cacao en sus unidades agrícolas, el cacao representa la segunda área plantada más grande de la región con aproximadamente 34,750 ha y registra una producción anual de 20,046 t (INEI, 2019; MIDAGRI, 2021). El cacao es también el tercer producto más importante a nivel regional en términos de su contribución al Valor Bruto de Producción (VBP) de Ucayali (16.4%) y al valor de las exportaciones totales (9.5%) (MIDAGRI, 2022; MINCETUR, 2021). A nivel nacional, Ucayali se

constituye como el tercer mayor productor de granos de cacao, con una producción basada en el monocultivo que ha aumentado sustancialmente en los últimos años y cuyo principal destino es el mercado externo (Charry et al., 2020).
Adicional al cacao, para la implementación de HOLPA se incluyó también a los sistemas productivos de camu camu (Myrciaria dubia H.B.K), como producto nativo de importancia económica en la región y considerado emblemático por el GRU. Estando presente en las zonas inundables, como la orilla de los ríos y lagunas, posee un área cosechada de 938 ha, una producción anual de 2005 t y una contribución al VBP del 0.4% (MIDAGRI, 2022). A nivel nacional, Ucayali representa el segundo productor más importante de camu camu bajo el sistema de monocultivo, teniendo al mercado local y a Lima como sus principales mercados.
Los sistemas productivos de frutales integran diferentes cultivos como plátano, limón, naranja, piña y mandarina. Bajo diferentes sistemas de producción, estos se siembran también en conjunto con otros productos como ajies, palta y yuca. En términos de área cosechada y nivel de producción, se distingue el plátano, limón, naranja y piña. Su principal mercado es el local y Lima.
En este contexto, a partir de diversas reuniones multi-actor en el marco de la Iniciativa de Agroecología, se seleccionaron determinas organizaciones y socios estratégicos. A continuación, se describe brevemente aquellas con mayor protagonismo y que, a excepción de la cooperativa Colpa de Loros, participaron en la implementación de HOLPA:
Organizaciones de cacao
Cooperativa Agraria de Cacao Aromático Colpa de Loros2
La Cooperativa Agraria Cacao Aromático “Colpa de Loros” está compuesta por cerca de 400 productores de cacao orgánico ubicados en las provincias de Padre Abad y Coronel Portillo (región Ucayali) y Puerto Inca (región Huánuco). Los socios abarcan un área de aproximadamente 7681 ha, de las cuales 1898 ha están dedicadas al cultivo de cacao. Además, los agricultores cuentan con áreas de bosque, tierras en barbecho con bosque secundario -conocido localmente como purma-, pastizales, cultivos anuales y perennes (Cooperativa Colpa de Loros, 2023).
Para atender un nicho de mercado diferenciado, la cooperativa prioriza su producción en cacao de “sabor fino” o aromático, pero sus miembros también producen cacao convencional (variedad CCN51). Toda su producción está destinada al mercado internacional a través de una alianza comercial con la empresa chocolatera francesa Kaoka. Actualmente, se exporta un promedio de 1000 toneladas de granos de cacao seco. El cacao exportado cuenta con certificación orgánica y de comercio justo (Narjes & Charry, 2022).
Cooperativa Agraria Banaqui Curimaná
La Cooperativa Agraria Banaqui Curimaná reune a 70 productores de cacao orgánico, distribuidos en los alrededores del distrito de Curimaná, provincia de Padre Abad, Ucayali. En conjunto, los miembros de la cooperativa manejan un total de 1 411 ha que comprenden áreas de bosque, purma, pastizales, cacao y cultivos para la alimentación familiar (plátano, yuca, maíz, frijoles). Del total del área, se registraron 296 ha dedicadas al cultivo exclusivo de cacao, principalmente de la variedad CCN51 (Cooperativa Banaqui Curimaná, 2022). Además, la cooperativa acopia y comercializa cacao convencional de productores no asociados, que suman alrededor de 200 agricultores (Charry et al., 2023).
La mayor parte de la producción de esta cooperativa está destinada al mercado de exportación (99,8%). Sus tres principales clientes son la empresa italiana ICAM, la empresa con sede en Singapur Olam y la empresa italiana Altromercato3. Para la campaña agrícola 2022, la cooperativa reporta haber comercializado 480 toneladas de granos de cacao seco (entre convencional y orgánico). Su cacao orgánico está certificado y está en proceso de obtener la certificación de comercio justo (Charry et al., 2023).
Organizaciones relacionadas al sistema de camu camu
Asociación de productores de camu camu de Pucallpillo
Esta asociación reune a 22 familias productoras de camu camu del caserío Pucallpillo, distrito Manantay. Las familias complementan su producción con productos hortícolas (sandía, melón, culantro, caigua, tomate, ají dulce) y cultivos temporales (frijol yuca, plátano, maíz, soya y frijol Chiclayo) que producen para el consumo familiar y en menor medida para la
2 Aunque esta cooperativa ha sido un socio principal desde el inicio de la Iniciativa Agroecológica en Perú en todos los paquetes de trabajo, no se incluyó en la muestra para la recopilación de datos de HOLPA debido a las múltiples contribuciones de la cooperativa a otros estudios y a las limitaciones de tiempo de sus miembros.

comercialización local. Su producción es principalmente agroecológica y reciben asistencia técnica de la ONG Agrosalud Ucayali.
Sociedad civil – ONG Agrosalud de Ucayali
Agrosalud es una organización sin fines de lucro ubicada en la ciudad de Pucallpa y con intervenciones en distritos rurales, caseríos y comunidades nativas de la región Ucayali. Su misión es mejorar las condiciones de vida de familias rurales mediante la promoción y el desarrollo de capacidades en prácticas agroecológicas y de alimentación saludable. La organización trabaja bajo cinco líneas estratégicas: i) Extensión rural agroecológica; ii) Investigación participativa agroecológica; iii) Alimentación saludable; iv) Fortalecimiento organizacional; v) Empoderamiento de las mujeres rurales. En el marco de la Iniciativa en Agroecología del CGIAR, implementaron pilotos de huertas agroecológicas con familias productoras de cacao para fortalecer la producción y consumo de alimentos locales y ecológicos. La organización actualmente trabaja con familias productoras de camu camu vinculadas a dos organizaciones de productores en los distritos de Callería y Manantay para mejorar la integración de prácticas agroecológicas al sistema productivo, fortalecer su conexión al mercado y asegurar el empoderamiento de mujeres y jóvenes rurales.
Organizaciones relacionadas a los sistemas de frutales
Asociación de Productores Ecológicos “El Pimental”
Esta asociación esta conformada por productores agroecológicos. Fundada en el año 2000 por 35 familias rurales que iniciaron sus actividades con el objetivo de desarrollar una agricultura para recuperar áreas degradadas por la agricultura migratoria y asociada a la deforestación. Actualmente reúne a 22 familias del distrito de Campo Verde que se dedican a la producción y comercialización de frutales amazónicos (aguaje, copoazú, arazá, carambola, guanábana, anona, entre otros); ajíes nativos (charapita rojo, charapita amarillo, cerecito, ayuyo, entre otros); especias (kión, cúrcuma, pimienta) y cultivos anuales (yuca, plátano, arroz). Su producción se desarrolla en sistemas agroforestales integrando cultivos anuales, especies forestales, frutales y especies arbustivas. Actualmente se dedican a la transformación y comercialización de ajíes nativos. Han recibido premios nacionales por su trabajo en la conservación de especies nativas de ajíes amazónicos.
De la visión al plan de acción del ALL
El proceso de visión a acción en el ALL de Perú se llevó a cabo entre julio de 2022 y junio de 2023 y consistió en una serie de talleres multi-actor realizados en las ciudades de Pucallpa, Neshuya y Curimaná, región Ucayali (Figura 4). Estos talleres, cinco en su conjunto, fueron diseñados y facilitados considerando dos escalas o niveles de acción e intervención con miras a una transición agroecológica en el corredor agroforestal Pucallpa-Aguaytía.

La primera escala que orientó el proceso de visión a acción reunió a productores de cacao y a sus organizaciones. Considerando que algunos paquetes de trabajo de la IA desarrollaron sus actividades específicamente con la cadena de valor del cacao, se asignó un espacio para discutir y acordar una visión y las acciones que abordasen las particularidades de los sistemas de producción y hogares cacaoteros y, asimismo, el rol que desempeñarían sus organizaciones en el acompañamiento del proceso de cambio visualizado. La segunda escala del proceso estuvo enfocada en los demás y diversos actores que integran el ecosistema institucional del corredor agroforestal y que provienen de los sectores público y privado, la sociedad civil, institutos académicos y de investigación. Con estos actores se trabajó una visión e identificaron acciones a nivel del territorio en su integridad – más allá del sistema productivo y cadena de valor cacaoteros – a través de talleres en la ciudad de Pucallpa.
La metodología que se aplicó en estos dos procesos de visión a acción siguió los pasos establecidos desde las directrices globales del WP14. Sin embargo, varias de las actividades fueron adaptadas al contexto y a los intereses de los actores convocados. Se adoptó un enfoque de investigación-acción participativa, siendo los talleres un punto de entrada para articular e involucrar a los diversos actores con presencia e intereses compartidos en el territorio. Entre los principales resultados derivados del proceso de visión a acción en las dos escalas, se cuenta con una visión consensuada con la identificación de los cambios necesarios y lo que estos implican a nivel de prácticas y comportamientos – desde las familias productoras hasta las instituciones; y asimismo la identificación de los factores facilitadores e inhabilitadores hacia la concretización de esta visión. Sobre esta base se codiseñó una teoría de cambio a modo de hoja de ruta para alcanzar esta visión, alineando a todos los actores interesados hacia un objetivo común – agricultura familiar sostenible y resiliente en el corredor agroforestal o ALL - y una narrativa que, de manera coherente, sepa articular claramente una ruta de transición. Finalmente, una primera etapa de la ruta de transición se operacionalizó colectivamente en un plan de acción a nivel del ALL que sirvió para identificar puntos de entrada concretos y estratégicos desde la Iniciativa a la vez que se integrarían actividades más allá de la Iniciativa de Agroecología y en sinergia con otras iniciativas locales e institucionales en el territorio.
A partir de los resultados del proceso, el equipo de Perú identificó puntos de entrada para contribuir a la transición. La Figura 5 muestra la relación entre las acciones estratégicas de la Iniciativa en Agroecología y los cambios deseados que fueron identificados por los actores en la escala de sistema de cacao y corredor agroforestal. Por ejemplo, en relación con la mejora de los rendimientos de los cultivos agroecológicos en la agricultura familiar, co-diseñamos tres experimentos con productores de cacao y sus organizaciones. Los experimentos están dirigidos a probar diferentes tratamientos ecológicos para prevenir la aparición de monilia (un hongo que afecta la productividad del cacao) y diferentes formulaciones de biofertilizantes que pueden apoyar la nutrición y el mejoramiento de las plantaciones de cacao.
En relación con los ingresos económicos y la seguridad alimentaria de la agricultura familiar, identificamos oportunidades para explorar un proyecto de créditos de carbono con una de las cooperativas de cacao. Desarrollamos un estudio de factibilidad sobre el Proyecto de Carbono en Colpa de Loros bajo el Estándar Plan Vivo que incluye una evaluación integral de las reservas de carbono en la cobertura forestal asociada, los sistemas agroforestales y el suelo. La pregunta principal gira en torno a la viabilidad de implementar un proyecto de carbono con el propósito de comercializar créditos de carbono.
Para abordar la integración de la agricultura familiar en los mercados y cadenas de valor de los productos agroecológicos, apoyamos al proceso de reconocimiento institucional del Consejo Regional de Ucayali del Sistema de Garantía Participativo. Para ello, hemos trabajado junto con sus miembros en la sensibilización y concientización sobre la agroecología; y en el terreno trabajando con agricultores interesados en organizarse para acceder a los mercados locales.
Por último, en términos de la articulación de los tomadores de decisiones y la sociedad civil para brindar un marco institucional favorable para la agricultura familiar, co-desarrollamos en asociación con Terra Nuova una Estrategia Regional de Promoción del Biocomercio con enfoque agroecológico para la región Ucayali. Esto se hizo a través de un proceso participativo que involucró a actores locales y también a miembros nacionales del Ministerio del Ambiente y ahora está aprobado por la Comisión Regional de Biocomercio. Hemos logrado insertar el enfoque agroecológico en las discusiones políticas asociadas al biocomercio. Para este cambio esperado, desde la Iniciativa también contribuimos con la socialización de resultados del estudio sobre Ferias Agroecológicas en Perú que fue liderado por el Centro Internacional de la Papa y en colaboración con la Asociación Nacional de Productores Ecológicos (ANPE) y el Instituto de Desarrollo y Medioambiente (IDMA).

2. OBJETIVO
La herramienta HOLPA busca comparar el desempeño holístico de la chacra, granja, paisaje y/o sistema productivo en diferentes fases de transición agroecológica. Este enfoque holístico incluye cuatro pilares de evaluación: agronómico, medioambiental, económico y social.
A través de esta herramienta se espera poder identificar los motores y las barreras de la transición agroecológica, así como evidenciar si la adopción de prácticas agroecológicas trae consigo resultados positivos en términos agronómicos, medioambientales, económicos y sociales. La evaluación del HOLPA en Perú se ha llevado a cabo a nivel del hogar agropecuario en tres diferentes sistemas productivos: cacao, camu camu y frutales.
Preguntas orientadoras de la investigación:
• ¿Cuál es el desempeño agronómico, medioambiental, económico y social de los hogares agropecuarios en diferentes niveles de transición agroecológica?
• ¿Hasta qué punto los hogares con un mayor avance agroecológica muestran mejores resultados en términos agronómico, medioambiental, económico y social que los hogares con un menor avance agroecológico?
3. METODOLOGIA
3.1 Proceso de localización de HOLPA
Los indicadores contextualmente relevantes para monitorear el desempeño agroecológico dentro del ALL fueron identificados a través de un taller en la ciudad de Pucallpa, Ucayali. El taller contó con la participación de representantes de 10 instituciones, con quienes se trabajó de la mano en diversas actividades de indagación previas en el marco de la IA y se co-diseñó la Teoría de Cambio para la transición agroecológica en el territorio.
La Teoría de Cambio - Ucayali fue la base para la identificación previa de los elementos clave de la transición agroecológica que orientarían la generación de indicadores localmente relevantes durante el taller. Específicamente, de los cuatro (4) impactos que figuran en la teoría de cambio se derivaron 16 elementos clave, que son los temas específicos (resumidos en una frase) que se infieren de los resultados o alcances intermedios en la teoría de cambio (Anexo A). A partir de estas temáticas, en grupos, se

listaron todos los indicadores referidos por los participantes para terminar con una priorización de estos. El reporte completo del proceso de localización se encuentra en: LISP_Report_PERU_11Dic_2023_FINAL_2.pdf.
A pesar de que la mayoría de los indicadores que resultaron del taller ya formaban parte de la herramienta de HOLPA, se logró identificar tres indicadores adicionales que permitieron profundizar temáticas de interés de los participantes. Las preguntas específicas de cada indicador y la forma de cálculo fueron trabajados internamente por el equipo del WP2. Los indicadores locales seleccionados que fueron integrados a HOLPA, la justificación de su selección, y cómo fueron incorporados a la encuesta global HOLPA figuran en la siguiente Tabla 1. Finalmente, sólo se analizó dos indicadores: origen de los productos de la dieta familiar y manejo de semillas. En el Anexo B se muestran las opciones de respuesta a cada pregunta, la descripción del cálculo del indicador y la asignación de puntajes respectivos. En el Anexo C se encuentra un análisis mas detallado de los resultados de los indicadores locales.

Agroecology Initiative
Technical Report
1. INTRODUCCIÓN
1.1 Antecedentes
La Iniciativa CGIAR ""Agroecología para Transformar los Sistemas Alimentarios"" fue concebida dentro de la Plataforma de Asociación Transformativa en Agroecología (TPP, por sus siglas en inglés), lanzada en año 2021, para fomentar la transición hacia sistemas agrícolas y alimentarios más sostenibles y, por lo tanto, contribuir a medios de vida y paisajes resilientes a diversas escalas, contextos y ubicaciones. A través de un enfoque colaborativo y transdisciplinario que involucra a una diversidad de actores, desde el nivel local hasta el nacional, la Iniciativa ha buscado abordar las principales brechas de conocimiento y los obstáculos de implementación que hasta ahora han impedido la adopción generalizada de la agroecología para la sostenibilidad de los sistemas alimentarios. Para ello, se viene trabajando a nivel de territorios denominados ""Paisajes Vivos Agroecológicos"" (ALL, por sus siglas en inglés) en ocho países: Burkina Faso, India, Kenia, Laos, Perú, Senegal, Túnez y Zimbabwe, reuniendo a agricultores y sus asociaciones, comunidades indígenas, investigadores de múltiples disciplinas, empresas del sector privado, organizaciones no gubernamentales y responsables de la formulación de políticas. Con la visión de contribuir a las transiciones agroecológicas a través de una investigación aplicada, se desarrollaron cinco paquetes de trabajo (WP, por sus siglas en inglés) diseñados para interactuar y complementarse entre sí. Dos de ellos, los Paquetes de Trabajo 2 y 5, se centraron en generar evidencia científica que pueda servir para guiar la futura aplicación de los enfoques agroecológicos; los Paquetes de Trabajo 3 y 4 abordaron estrategias de escalamiento adaptativo en dos frentes: la integración de la agroecología en los modelos de negocio y las cadenas de valor, y el fortalecimiento del entorno político e institucional para permitir las transiciones agroecológicas a escala; y el Paquete de Trabajo 1 cumplió dos funciones clave: articular todos los paquetes de trabajo a través de una Teoría de Cambio que delineara las acciones necesarias para catalizar una transición agroecológica en cada territorio, y probar innovaciones locales a nivel de campo y finca de manera pragmática. La Figura 1 proporciona una visión general de la interrelación y los resultados esperados de los cinco paquetes de trabajo en los ALL, y la Figura 2 ilustra sus interacciones específicamente en el ALL de Perú.

Figura 2. Interacciones de los paquetes de trabajo en el ALL de Perú
En el caso específico del Paquete de Trabajo 2, éste tuvo como propósito la generación de evidencia científica sobre la eficacia del enfoque agroecológico para proporcionar sistemas alimentarios sostenibles. Para ello, se desarrolló y pilotó la herramienta Evaluación Holística de Desempeño Agroecológico Localizado (Holistic Localized Agroecology Performance Assessment o HOLPA, por sus siglas en inglés) en una diversidad de contextos biofísicos y socioculturales. Dicha herramienta integró los 13 principios agroecológicos establecidos en el 2019 por el Panel de Alto Nivel de Expertos en Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición de la FAO (HLPE, por sus siglas en inglés), así como una serie de indicadores de carácter agronómico, medioambiental, económico y social. En Perú, la aplicación de HOLPA se llevó a cabo en el corredor agroforestal Pucallpa - Aguaytía, ubicado en la región amazónica de Ucayali. En la siguiente sección, se proporcionará una descripción del ALL para Perú, el cual fue elegido a través de un proceso de consulta con actores locales y regionales.
1.2 Contexto de la Iniciativa en Agroecología en Perú
Características y relevancia del ALL-Perú
El ALL de Perú se encuentra en la región amazónica del departamento de Ucayali, que comparte frontera con Brasil. Ucayali está compuesta por cuatro provincias: Coronel Portillo, Atalaya, Padre Abad y Purús, con una población total estimada de 589,110 habitantes (INEI, 2020). Con una extensión de 102 399.94 km 2, es la segunda región más grande del Perú y, con una densidad de 4.95 habitantes/km2, es también la tercera menos poblada (INEI, 2017a). Esta región cálida y húmeda tiene una temperatura promedio de 26°C y registra precipitaciones de hasta 4500 mm de lluvia por año (Centro de Conservación, Investigación y Manejo de Áreas Naturales [CIMA], 2017). Alberga una vasta red fluvial, teniendo como a uno de sus principales afluentes al río Aguaytía, que cruza todo el territorio que comprende el ALL. Este recurso hídrico es utilizado por los diferentes sectores (población, industria, agricultura y acuicultura), siendo el sector agrícola el que consume la mayor proporción (94%) (Autoridad Nacional del Agua [ANA], 2022)
La actividad económica de Ucayali se concentra, principalmente, en las provincias de Coronel Portillo y Padre Abad, donde vive el 89% de la población (INEI, 2020). En estas mismas provincias se encuentra ubicado el ALL de Perú. Específicamente, el ALL comprende toda la provincia de Padre Abad, los distritos de Nueva Requena, Campo Verde, Manantay y Yarinacocha de la provincia de Coronel Portillo, y la capital de Ucayali, Pucallpa. El ALL tiene un área de 14,064.11 km 2 y coincide con lo que el Gobierno Regional de Ucayali (GOREU) ha identificado como el corredor agroforestal Pucallpa-Aguaytía, también conocido como la cuenca del Aguaytía (Figura 3).

Figura 3. Ubicación del ALL en la región de Ucayali, Perú.
El corredor agroforestal Pucallpa – Aguaytía (donde se ubica el ALL), fue priorizado por el GOREU como parte de un ambicioso plan de desarrollo sostenible: la Estrategia Regional de Desarrollo Rural de Baja Emisión en la Región de Ucayali al 2030 (ERDRBE Ucayali 2030)1. Esta Estrategia Regional tiene como objetivo reducir la deforestación y mejorar la calidad de vida de la población de la región, con énfasis en las zonas rurales y las comunidades indígenas, buscando la sostenibilidad, la inclusión social y la competitividad económica de la región de Ucayali. Siendo el ALL un territorio que registra la tasa de deforestación más alta de Ucayali en las últimas dos décadas, con el 40% de sus bosques perdidos debido a la expansión de la frontera agrícola y la construcción de infraestructura, el GRU busca fomentar el desarrollo de actividades alternativas que sean económica y ambientalmente sostenibles, a la vez que contribuyan a la resiliencia al cambio climático (GOREU, 2020; MINAM, 2021).
Actualmente las actividades agrícolas que predominan en el ALL se basan en el monocultivo de palma de aceite, cacao, plátano, café, arroz, yuca y pastos para la ganadería, con implicaciones perjudiciales en términos de pérdida de biodiversidad, empobrecimiento del suelo y la fragmentación de los bosques que albergan una alta diversidad de especies y valiosos servicios ecosistémicos. Ante estas crecientes presiones, pero también su alto potencial forestal, acuícola y turístico, la presencia de ONG y organizaciones de agricultores alineadas con el enfoque agroecológico, y una política pública (ERDRBE Ucayali 2030) que apoya la visión agroecológica, el ALL constituyó el territorio propicio para el desarrollo de actividades de investigación y desarrollo como parte de la Iniciativa Agroecológica (IA).
Sistemas productivos y principales socios
Dado su relevancia socioeconómica y ambiental en la región de Ucayali, los sistemas de producción de cacao (Theobroma cacao) fueron el punto de entrada de las actividades de la Iniciativa de Agroecología en el ALL de Perú. Alrededor del 34% de los productores de Ucayali cultivan cacao en sus unidades agrícolas, el cacao representa la segunda área plantada más grande de la región con aproximadamente 34,750 ha y registra una producción anual de 20,046 t (INEI, 2019; MIDAGRI, 2021). El cacao es también el tercer producto más importante a nivel regional en términos de su contribución al Valor Bruto de Producción (VBP) de Ucayali (16.4%) y al valor de las exportaciones totales (9.5%) (MIDAGRI, 2022; MINCETUR, 2021). A nivel nacional, Ucayali se

constituye como el tercer mayor productor de granos de cacao, con una producción basada en el monocultivo que ha aumentado sustancialmente en los últimos años y cuyo principal destino es el mercado externo (Charry et al., 2020).
Adicional al cacao, para la implementación de HOLPA se incluyó también a los sistemas productivos de camu camu (Myrciaria dubia H.B.K), como producto nativo de importancia económica en la región y considerado emblemático por el GRU. Estando presente en las zonas inundables, como la orilla de los ríos y lagunas, posee un área cosechada de 938 ha, una producción anual de 2005 t y una contribución al VBP del 0.4% (MIDAGRI, 2022). A nivel nacional, Ucayali representa el segundo productor más importante de camu camu bajo el sistema de monocultivo, teniendo al mercado local y a Lima como sus principales mercados.
Los sistemas productivos de frutales integran diferentes cultivos como plátano, limón, naranja, piña y mandarina. Bajo diferentes sistemas de producción, estos se siembran también en conjunto con otros productos como ajies, palta y yuca. En términos de área cosechada y nivel de producción, se distingue el plátano, limón, naranja y piña. Su principal mercado es el local y Lima.
En este contexto, a partir de diversas reuniones multi-actor en el marco de la Iniciativa de Agroecología, se seleccionaron determinas organizaciones y socios estratégicos. A continuación, se describe brevemente aquellas con mayor protagonismo y que, a excepción de la cooperativa Colpa de Loros, participaron en la implementación de HOLPA:
Organizaciones de cacao
Cooperativa Agraria de Cacao Aromático Colpa de Loros2
La Cooperativa Agraria Cacao Aromático “Colpa de Loros” está compuesta por cerca de 400 productores de cacao orgánico ubicados en las provincias de Padre Abad y Coronel Portillo (región Ucayali) y Puerto Inca (región Huánuco). Los socios abarcan un área de aproximadamente 7681 ha, de las cuales 1898 ha están dedicadas al cultivo de cacao. Además, los agricultores cuentan con áreas de bosque, tierras en barbecho con bosque secundario -conocido localmente como purma-, pastizales, cultivos anuales y perennes (Cooperativa Colpa de Loros, 2023).
Para atender un nicho de mercado diferenciado, la cooperativa prioriza su producción en cacao de “sabor fino” o aromático, pero sus miembros también producen cacao convencional (variedad CCN51). Toda su producción está destinada al mercado internacional a través de una alianza comercial con la empresa chocolatera francesa Kaoka. Actualmente, se exporta un promedio de 1000 toneladas de granos de cacao seco. El cacao exportado cuenta con certificación orgánica y de comercio justo (Narjes & Charry, 2022).
Cooperativa Agraria Banaqui Curimaná
La Cooperativa Agraria Banaqui Curimaná reune a 70 productores de cacao orgánico, distribuidos en los alrededores del distrito de Curimaná, provincia de Padre Abad, Ucayali. En conjunto, los miembros de la cooperativa manejan un total de 1 411 ha que comprenden áreas de bosque, purma, pastizales, cacao y cultivos para la alimentación familiar (plátano, yuca, maíz, frijoles). Del total del área, se registraron 296 ha dedicadas al cultivo exclusivo de cacao, principalmente de la variedad CCN51 (Cooperativa Banaqui Curimaná, 2022). Además, la cooperativa acopia y comercializa cacao convencional de productores no asociados, que suman alrededor de 200 agricultores (Charry et al., 2023).
La mayor parte de la producción de esta cooperativa está destinada al mercado de exportación (99,8%). Sus tres principales clientes son la empresa italiana ICAM, la empresa con sede en Singapur Olam y la empresa italiana Altromercato3. Para la campaña agrícola 2022, la cooperativa reporta haber comercializado 480 toneladas de granos de cacao seco (entre convencional y orgánico). Su cacao orgánico está certificado y está en proceso de obtener la certificación de comercio justo (Charry et al., 2023).
Organizaciones relacionadas al sistema de camu camu
Asociación de productores de camu camu de Pucallpillo
Esta asociación reune a 22 familias productoras de camu camu del caserío Pucallpillo, distrito Manantay. Las familias complementan su producción con productos hortícolas (sandía, melón, culantro, caigua, tomate, ají dulce) y cultivos temporales (frijol yuca, plátano, maíz, soya y frijol Chiclayo) que producen para el consumo familiar y en menor medida para la
2 Aunque esta cooperativa ha sido un socio principal desde el inicio de la Iniciativa Agroecológica en Perú en todos los paquetes de trabajo, no se incluyó en la muestra para la recopilación de datos de HOLPA debido a las múltiples contribuciones de la cooperativa a otros estudios y a las limitaciones de tiempo de sus miembros.

comercialización local. Su producción es principalmente agroecológica y reciben asistencia técnica de la ONG Agrosalud Ucayali.
Sociedad civil – ONG Agrosalud de Ucayali
Agrosalud es una organización sin fines de lucro ubicada en la ciudad de Pucallpa y con intervenciones en distritos rurales, caseríos y comunidades nativas de la región Ucayali. Su misión es mejorar las condiciones de vida de familias rurales mediante la promoción y el desarrollo de capacidades en prácticas agroecológicas y de alimentación saludable. La organización trabaja bajo cinco líneas estratégicas: i) Extensión rural agroecológica; ii) Investigación participativa agroecológica; iii) Alimentación saludable; iv) Fortalecimiento organizacional; v) Empoderamiento de las mujeres rurales. En el marco de la Iniciativa en Agroecología del CGIAR, implementaron pilotos de huertas agroecológicas con familias productoras de cacao para fortalecer la producción y consumo de alimentos locales y ecológicos. La organización actualmente trabaja con familias productoras de camu camu vinculadas a dos organizaciones de productores en los distritos de Callería y Manantay para mejorar la integración de prácticas agroecológicas al sistema productivo, fortalecer su conexión al mercado y asegurar el empoderamiento de mujeres y jóvenes rurales.
Organizaciones relacionadas a los sistemas de frutales
Asociación de Productores Ecológicos “El Pimental”
Esta asociación esta conformada por productores agroecológicos. Fundada en el año 2000 por 35 familias rurales que iniciaron sus actividades con el objetivo de desarrollar una agricultura para recuperar áreas degradadas por la agricultura migratoria y asociada a la deforestación. Actualmente reúne a 22 familias del distrito de Campo Verde que se dedican a la producción y comercialización de frutales amazónicos (aguaje, copoazú, arazá, carambola, guanábana, anona, entre otros); ajíes nativos (charapita rojo, charapita amarillo, cerecito, ayuyo, entre otros); especias (kión, cúrcuma, pimienta) y cultivos anuales (yuca, plátano, arroz). Su producción se desarrolla en sistemas agroforestales integrando cultivos anuales, especies forestales, frutales y especies arbustivas. Actualmente se dedican a la transformación y comercialización de ajíes nativos. Han recibido premios nacionales por su trabajo en la conservación de especies nativas de ajíes amazónicos.
De la visión al plan de acción del ALL
El proceso de visión a acción en el ALL de Perú se llevó a cabo entre julio de 2022 y junio de 2023 y consistió en una serie de talleres multi-actor realizados en las ciudades de Pucallpa, Neshuya y Curimaná, región Ucayali (Figura 4). Estos talleres, cinco en su conjunto, fueron diseñados y facilitados considerando dos escalas o niveles de acción e intervención con miras a una transición agroecológica en el corredor agroforestal Pucallpa-Aguaytía.

La primera escala que orientó el proceso de visión a acción reunió a productores de cacao y a sus organizaciones. Considerando que algunos paquetes de trabajo de la IA desarrollaron sus actividades específicamente con la cadena de valor del cacao, se asignó un espacio para discutir y acordar una visión y las acciones que abordasen las particularidades de los sistemas de producción y hogares cacaoteros y, asimismo, el rol que desempeñarían sus organizaciones en el acompañamiento del proceso de cambio visualizado. La segunda escala del proceso estuvo enfocada en los demás y diversos actores que integran el ecosistema institucional del corredor agroforestal y que provienen de los sectores público y privado, la sociedad civil, institutos académicos y de investigación. Con estos actores se trabajó una visión e identificaron acciones a nivel del territorio en su integridad – más allá del sistema productivo y cadena de valor cacaoteros – a través de talleres en la ciudad de Pucallpa.
La metodología que se aplicó en estos dos procesos de visión a acción siguió los pasos establecidos desde las directrices globales del WP14. Sin embargo, varias de las actividades fueron adaptadas al contexto y a los intereses de los actores convocados. Se adoptó un enfoque de investigación-acción participativa, siendo los talleres un punto de entrada para articular e involucrar a los diversos actores con presencia e intereses compartidos en el territorio. Entre los principales resultados derivados del proceso de visión a acción en las dos escalas, se cuenta con una visión consensuada con la identificación de los cambios necesarios y lo que estos implican a nivel de prácticas y comportamientos – desde las familias productoras hasta las instituciones; y asimismo la identificación de los factores facilitadores e inhabilitadores hacia la concretización de esta visión. Sobre esta base se codiseñó una teoría de cambio a modo de hoja de ruta para alcanzar esta visión, alineando a todos los actores interesados hacia un objetivo común – agricultura familiar sostenible y resiliente en el corredor agroforestal o ALL - y una narrativa que, de manera coherente, sepa articular claramente una ruta de transición. Finalmente, una primera etapa de la ruta de transición se operacionalizó colectivamente en un plan de acción a nivel del ALL que sirvió para identificar puntos de entrada concretos y estratégicos desde la Iniciativa a la vez que se integrarían actividades más allá de la Iniciativa de Agroecología y en sinergia con otras iniciativas locales e institucionales en el territorio.
A partir de los resultados del proceso, el equipo de Perú identificó puntos de entrada para contribuir a la transición. La Figura 5 muestra la relación entre las acciones estratégicas de la Iniciativa en Agroecología y los cambios deseados que fueron identificados por los actores en la escala de sistema de cacao y corredor agroforestal. Por ejemplo, en relación con la mejora de los rendimientos de los cultivos agroecológicos en la agricultura familiar, co-diseñamos tres experimentos con productores de cacao y sus organizaciones. Los experimentos están dirigidos a probar diferentes tratamientos ecológicos para prevenir la aparición de monilia (un hongo que afecta la productividad del cacao) y diferentes formulaciones de biofertilizantes que pueden apoyar la nutrición y el mejoramiento de las plantaciones de cacao.
En relación con los ingresos económicos y la seguridad alimentaria de la agricultura familiar, identificamos oportunidades para explorar un proyecto de créditos de carbono con una de las cooperativas de cacao. Desarrollamos un estudio de factibilidad sobre el Proyecto de Carbono en Colpa de Loros bajo el Estándar Plan Vivo que incluye una evaluación integral de las reservas de carbono en la cobertura forestal asociada, los sistemas agroforestales y el suelo. La pregunta principal gira en torno a la viabilidad de implementar un proyecto de carbono con el propósito de comercializar créditos de carbono.
Para abordar la integración de la agricultura familiar en los mercados y cadenas de valor de los productos agroecológicos, apoyamos al proceso de reconocimiento institucional del Consejo Regional de Ucayali del Sistema de Garantía Participativo. Para ello, hemos trabajado junto con sus miembros en la sensibilización y concientización sobre la agroecología; y en el terreno trabajando con agricultores interesados en organizarse para acceder a los mercados locales.
Por último, en términos de la articulación de los tomadores de decisiones y la sociedad civil para brindar un marco institucional favorable para la agricultura familiar, co-desarrollamos en asociación con Terra Nuova una Estrategia Regional de Promoción del Biocomercio con enfoque agroecológico para la región Ucayali. Esto se hizo a través de un proceso participativo que involucró a actores locales y también a miembros nacionales del Ministerio del Ambiente y ahora está aprobado por la Comisión Regional de Biocomercio. Hemos logrado insertar el enfoque agroecológico en las discusiones políticas asociadas al biocomercio. Para este cambio esperado, desde la Iniciativa también contribuimos con la socialización de resultados del estudio sobre Ferias Agroecológicas en Perú que fue liderado por el Centro Internacional de la Papa y en colaboración con la Asociación Nacional de Productores Ecológicos (ANPE) y el Instituto de Desarrollo y Medioambiente (IDMA).

2. OBJETIVO
La herramienta HOLPA busca comparar el desempeño holístico de la chacra, granja, paisaje y/o sistema productivo en diferentes fases de transición agroecológica. Este enfoque holístico incluye cuatro pilares de evaluación: agronómico, medioambiental, económico y social.
A través de esta herramienta se espera poder identificar los motores y las barreras de la transición agroecológica, así como evidenciar si la adopción de prácticas agroecológicas trae consigo resultados positivos en términos agronómicos, medioambientales, económicos y sociales. La evaluación del HOLPA en Perú se ha llevado a cabo a nivel del hogar agropecuario en tres diferentes sistemas productivos: cacao, camu camu y frutales.
Preguntas orientadoras de la investigación:
• ¿Cuál es el desempeño agronómico, medioambiental, económico y social de los hogares agropecuarios en diferentes niveles de transición agroecológica?
• ¿Hasta qué punto los hogares con un mayor avance agroecológica muestran mejores resultados en términos agronómico, medioambiental, económico y social que los hogares con un menor avance agroecológico?
3. METODOLOGIA
3.1 Proceso de localización de HOLPA
Los indicadores contextualmente relevantes para monitorear el desempeño agroecológico dentro del ALL fueron identificados a través de un taller en la ciudad de Pucallpa, Ucayali. El taller contó con la participación de representantes de 10 instituciones, con quienes se trabajó de la mano en diversas actividades de indagación previas en el marco de la IA y se co-diseñó la Teoría de Cambio para la transición agroecológica en el territorio.
La Teoría de Cambio - Ucayali fue la base para la identificación previa de los elementos clave de la transición agroecológica que orientarían la generación de indicadores localmente relevantes durante el taller. Específicamente, de los cuatro (4) impactos que figuran en la teoría de cambio se derivaron 16 elementos clave, que son los temas específicos (resumidos en una frase) que se infieren de los resultados o alcances intermedios en la teoría de cambio (Anexo A). A partir de estas temáticas, en grupos, se

listaron todos los indicadores referidos por los participantes para terminar con una priorización de estos. El reporte completo del proceso de localización se encuentra en: LISP_Report_PERU_11Dic_2023_FINAL_2.pdf.
A pesar de que la mayoría de los indicadores que resultaron del taller ya formaban parte de la herramienta de HOLPA, se logró identificar tres indicadores adicionales que permitieron profundizar temáticas de interés de los participantes. Las preguntas específicas de cada indicador y la forma de cálculo fueron trabajados internamente por el equipo del WP2. Los indicadores locales seleccionados que fueron integrados a HOLPA, la justificación de su selección, y cómo fueron incorporados a la encuesta global HOLPA figuran en la siguiente Tabla 1. Finalmente, sólo se analizó dos indicadores: origen de los productos de la dieta familiar y manejo de semillas. En el Anexo B se muestran las opciones de respuesta a cada pregunta, la descripción del cálculo del indicador y la asignación de puntajes respectivos. En el Anexo C se encuentra un análisis mas detallado de los resultados de los indicadores locales.

Mapeo de la Red Latinoamericana de Investigación Agronómica: interacciones y consolidación en el contexto de los nodos de innovación
1.1. Introducción
La Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica (RedAgAl) integrada por investigadores de México, Guatemala, Honduras y Colombia llevan a cabo investigación participativa para mejorar los sistemas de producción de maíz, trigo y frijol (Fig. 1). Muchos de ellos son responsables de plataformas de investigación. Las plataformas de investigación forman parte de la estructura física de los nodos de innovación en el CIMMYT. Estos son espacios de investigación para promover sistemas agroalimentarios sostenibles que abordan desafíos ambientales, agrícolas globales y de seguridad alimentaria. La investigación, desarrollo y extensión se lleva a cabo en colaboración con los actores locales, incluyendo científicos, académicos, técnicos, agricultores y otros actores clave. Esta vinculación desde un inicio aumenta la posibilidad de generar mayor impacto. De esta manera la co-creación de conocimientos es un proceso colaborativo lo que resulta en el desarrollo de conocimientos y soluciones que de otro modo no se alcanzarían de forma independiente.

En este sentido es importante reducir las brechas de cooperación entre los agricultores e investigadores y otros actores clave a través de enlazar colaboraciones y enfoques entre el
conocimiento formal —investigación científica— e informal —tradicional o local de los agricultores. Por esta razón es importante conocer quien en la red interactúa con quien y sobre qué temas, y también indicar a quien más podríamos incluir en la red. Además de identificar las áreas de oportunidad para el fortalecimiento de estas relaciones. Es por esta razón que se realizó un estudio sobre el mapeo de actores en la Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica para llevar a cabo acciones estratégicas que fortalezcan la interacción y consolidación de dicha red en el contexto de los nodos de innovación.
1.2. Materiales y métodos
El estudio se realizó en los nodos de innovación de México, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia y Perú. Durante 2024 se hicieron entrevistas semiestructuradas a los colaboradores involucrados en la Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica. Para esto se implementó la metodología de redes de innovación (Clark, 2006; Rendón et al, 2007). Se usó un muestreo dirigido para identificar 61 actores a entrevistar (Aguilar et al., 2007). La información colectada se derivó de preguntas como: ¿Con quién te relacionas para actividades concernientes con las plataformas de investigación?, ¿Qué actividades o prácticas relacionadas con la plataforma realizan juntos?, ¿Desde qué año?, y ¿Cuáles son los tres principales retos de hacer investigación y extensión? Con esta información se calcularon y graficaron los indicadores de la red — cobertura, centralización y diversidad— y la identificación de los actores clave —articulador, colector y fuente—. Se analizaron los datos colectados usando los Software UCINET 6.288, Netdraw© y KeyPlayer2.
Analizar las propiedades de la red como la densidad y centralización dará una idea de cómo se concentra la información y/o toma de decisiones. Una red muy centralizada —100% es altamente concentrada — evidencia a pocos actores controlando la información, dependiendo de los objetivos, esto puede ser favorable o no. La densidad mostrará el porcentaje de relaciones existentes de las posibles en la red. Una alta densidad puede indicar un amplio acceso de los actores a la información disponible en la red. Identificar la fortaleza de los vínculos puede reflejar el tiempo, intensidad emocional, confianza y reciprocidad que hay entre los actores (Rendón et al., 2007). Por otra parte, el análisis estructural de la red se refiere al rol e influencia de los actores dentro de esta. En este estudio se analizan los actores articuladores, fuente y colectores. Los articuladores son el puente entre uno o varios grupos de actores y tienen la función de enlazar y promover los flujos de información, su eliminación provocaría ruptura de la red. Los actores fuente son aquellos que transmiten información, a través de la validación y filtración por lo que también pueden suprimir información. Los actores colectores son sensibles a experimentar e innovar porque buscan información de la red para implementar.
1.3. Resultados y discusión
1.3.1. Actores de la Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica y actividades implementadas
La Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica se integra de 184 actores y la cobertura territorial incluye México (84.2%), Honduras (4.3%), Guatemala (3.8), Colombia (2.7%), Estados Unidos (2.7%) y Perú (2.2%) (Fig. 2). Los tipos de actores son centros de enseñanza e investigación (58.2%), organizaciones de productores (12%), instituciones de gobierno (11.4%), prestadores de servicios profesionales (9.2%), funciones múltiples (4.3%), empresa rural (productores) (2.2%) y otros con menos del 2% (Figura 3). No obstante que hay varios tipos de actores, la diversidad es baja (-0.95 E-I Index) por lo tanto es una red homofílica, puesto que la mayoría de los actores pertenecen a centros de investigación o a la academia.

Los actores de la red hacen actividades relacionadas con la investigación (58.9%), el extensionismo (16.9%) y 24.2% ambos (investigación y extensión). En el contexto de productores tanto de autoconsumo y comercial (57.4%), seguido de únicamente comercial (23.0%) y de autoconsumo (19.7%). Los principales cultivos estudiados son maíz (55.2%), frijol (19.4%), trigo (14.9%) y otros (10.4%; cebada, sorgo, alfalfa, arroz, café, pitahaya, mango, mango, durazno, chile, forrajes). Las semillas mejoradas son las más usadas en la red (50%), seguido de la interacción de sistemas donde usan semillas tanto mejoradas como nativas (37.5%) y solo el 12.5% trabaja con variedades nativas. El régimen hídrico donde hay oportunidad de trabajar en siembras tanto en riego como de temporal es el más usado (40%), seguido de condiciones de temporal (37.5) y riego (22.5%).
Los principales temas de investigación se relacionan con prácticas de conservación de suelo (16.2%), fertilidad (12.3%), diversificación de cultivos (11.8%), manejo integrado de plagas (8.3%), uso de variedades adecuadas (7.8%), prácticas de conservación de agua (7.4%), manejo integrado de malezas (6.4%), siembra (6.4%), preparación del terreno (5.4%) y otros (menos de 5%; cosecha y poscosecha, mecanización inteligente, manejo integrado de enfermedades, agricultura digital agricultura de precisión, acceso a mercados, inclusión social, producción animal y cultivos de cobertura).
Los retos que los actores de la red enfrentan para hacer investigación y extensión se clasifican en nueve temas (Tabla 1); sin embargo, los más recurrentes están relacionados con el acceso y disponibilidad de recursos (económicos y técnicos) (24.5%), capacitación y transferencia de conocimiento (21.1%), cambio climático (13.6%) y otros.

1.3.2. Caracterización de la red de actores
Respecto a los atributos de la red, el porcentaje en el que los miembros de la red se relacionan y comunican es bajo (0.01% de densidad), esto significa que las conexiones entre los miembros son cerca de ser nulas, probablemente debido a la dispersión geográfica de los actores o la especificidad de los contextos territoriales, por lo que la capacidad para acceder a la red de forma estratégica es baja. Sobre las relaciones que hay entre los actores; los actores dicen mantener más relaciones con otros actores — flechas hacia afuera— (10.7%) de lo que otros actores refieren mantener con un actor —flechas hacia adentro— (0.7%). La fuerza de los vínculos es intermedia; hay colaboraciones que comenzaron desde 1996, pero en 2017 es el año donde más personas (24.6%) indicaron haber iniciado una colaboración con otros actores de la red (Figura 4).

Figura 4. Porcentaje de inicio de colaboraciones entre los actores de la red de plataformas de investigación de 1996 a 2024.
Por lo que es necesario emprender acciones que mejoren la densidad de la red. Algunas intervenciones que pueden favorecer la interacción y el flujo de información son: grupos de foros en redes sociales, giras de intercambio, días de campo, reuniones de grupo, ferias e implementación de redes de ensayos con temas similares de investigación en los diferentes hubs.
El índice de centralización es bajo (10.8%), esto significa que no hay un actor o grupo de actores que controlen o influyan de manera significativa la toma de decisiones o de información dentro de la red. En algunos casos tener estructuras multicéntricas, sin el dominio de un actor, pueden considerarse redes que tienden rápidamente a la madurez. Debido a que hay menos posibilidad de fragmentación de la red, si un actor desaparece. Sin embargo, es importante identificar los actores clave para derivar acciones de forma estratégica en múltiples grupos y hacer llegar la información e impacto deseado.
Se identificaron los actores clave de la red —estructurales, fuentes y articuladores — con base a su posición, roles e influencia en los diferentes actores. El número de actores seleccionados depende de la capacidad de recursos del proyecto y la eficiencia de impacto sobre la red — considerando el impacto en la red si se removieran—, por lo que el número de actores se estableció entre cinco o seis.
Se identificó que cuatro de los cinco actores articuladores — nodos puente que enlazan a dos o más grupos— pertenecen al staff de CIMMYT; IE05, IE11, IE21, IE22 y un actor a Oaxaca, IE27, remover estos 5 nodos causaría una fragmentación del 43.1 % de la red (Figura 4).

la red es un papel importante para entender quién podría apoyar la difusión de la información. En este caso se seleccionó cinco actores fuente — nodos origen o proveedor de información que son altamente referenciados por los actores de la red — que resultaron en el máximo porcentaje de acceso a la red (88.1%) y son los actores IE11, IE21 —staff CIMMYT—, IE28, OR2 y PS09 y PS11—colaboradores en México—. Los actores que buscan más información en la red y pueden llegar al 20.9% son IE48, IE20 —staff CIMMYT—, FM01, FM02, IE47, y PF01 —colaboradores en México— (Figura 5).

1.3.3. Percepción de los actores sobre la red de plataformas de investigación
Sobre el punto de vista que tienen los actores de la red acerca de las plataformas de investigación, hay una visión mayormente positiva sobre las plataformas, pero también destacan áreas clave de mejora, especialmente en la divulgación de los resultados y su aplicación directa para los productores. En seguida cinco categorías que reflejan aspectos clave de su valoración.
1. Valoración positiva de las plataformas de investigación: Son espacios para la investigación, capacitación y transferencia de tecnología. Así lo comentaron los colaboradores;
""Es un buen espacio para capacitación a estudiantes y productores, transferencia de tecnología y para realizar investigación.""
""Son indispensables para la generación de conocimiento.""
""Es un espacio muy valioso para el intercambio de experiencias en investigación.""
""Representan una gran oportunidad para adquirir conocimientos con bases sólidas de investigación.""
""Es un excelente espacio para compartir investigaciones y resultados obtenidos de cada región.""
Generación de conocimiento y colaboración:
""Son estructuras donde nos permite evaluar diferentes escenarios en la producción de granos básicos.""

• Ampliación y fortalecimiento de la red:
""Es numerosa y se necesita seguir sumando colaboradores.""
""Es una buena red, requiere nuevas plataformas para considerar la mayoría de los ambientes de producción.""
""Se requiere de mejores mecanismos para transmitir mejor los resultados hacia los productores.""
• Mejor integración y colaboración interinstitucional:
""Es necesario mantener mayor vinculación entre plataformas.""
3. Impacto en la resolución de problemas locales:
• Aplicación de la investigación a problemas específicos:
""Son importantes y valiosas porque permiten avanzar en la investigación dirigida a resolver las problemáticas regionales.""
""La red de plataformas de investigación es necesaria para coadyuvar en la solución de problemas actuales, como la degradación del suelo, el cambio climático y la mejora de la rentabilidad.""
""Algunas alternativas validadas en otras plataformas han ayudado a resolver la
problemática local.""
• Diversidad geográfica y agroecológica:
""Considero que existe una gran diversidad de zonas agroecológicas, por lo que tener plataformas en cada una de ellas resulta una oportunidad para responder a problemáticas
locales.""
4. Reconocimiento y apreciación de la red:
• Valoración de la metodología y los resultados:
""Es una iniciativa que contempla una metodología innovadora para la generación de datos, introducción de nuevas especies, y generación de capacidades técnicas.""
""Excelente iniciativa para dar respuesta a problemas reales de la producción agrícola.""

5. Críticas sobre la permeabilidad hacia los productores:
• Dificultades para llegar a los productores:
""Si bien en las plataformas se hace investigación de calidad, el conocimiento generado no ha permeado en los productores de la zona de influencia.""
""La mayoría de la información es valiosa, pero falta que los productores la adopten.""
Además de consultar la opinión de los actores sobre las plataformas de investigación, tambien se analizó el valor de pertenecer a la red de plataformas. Donde se destacó la percepción sobre el respaldo que los actores tienen para acceder a información, la colaboración multidisciplinaria, y la capacitación y transferencia de conocimientos como los principales beneficios.
1.-Acceso a información y conocimiento (35.8%): la red de plataformas ofrece acceso a información de calidad, investigaciones innovadoras y resultados valiosos que se pueden aplicar localmente. Así lo comentaron los colaboradores:
""Acceder a información de primera mano que genera el CIMMYT.""
""Obtener y compartir información validada y útil para regiones específicas.""
""Conocer los resultados de investigación, las innovaciones, tener el contacto para solventar dudas”. 2.- Colaboración y vinculación (28.4%): la colaboración con actores clave como el CIMMYT, otros investigadores, técnicos y productores es fundamental para resolver problemas agrícolas y avanzar en la investigación. De esta forma lo expresaron algunos actores de la red;
""La generación de nuevo conocimiento para transferir a los productores.""
""Información regional, específica para la toma de decisiones.""
""La vinculación y colaboración con otras plataformas facilita el intercambio de técnicas y estrategias."" 3.- Capacitación y formación (13.4%): las plataformas brindan espacios para capacitar a estudiantes y productores, así como para fortalecer capacidades técnicas y transferir conocimiento. Así lo dijeron algunos entrevistados;
""Es posible compartir, conocer y adaptar técnicas y estrategias que implementan otros actores de la red."" ""Poder ser partícipe del establecimiento de nuevas técnicas para desarrollar la agricultura en el Estado de Sinaloa.""
4.- Impacto local y aplicación práctica (11.9%): las plataformas contribuyen directamente a resolver problemas locales y mejorar la producción agrícola mediante el intercambio de experiencias y la implementación de innovaciones. De esta forma lo expresaron algunos actores de la red;
""Somos el socio implementador en la región que nos permite iniciar, probar, innovar y generar conocimientos de la mano del productor.""
""El Oriente de Guatemala se convierte en el granero del país, y la visión es promover la agricultura de innovación.""

""El acceso a información y resultados de investigación es vital para mejorar la producción de maíz en la región.""
""Colaborar con otros actores contribuye a eficientizar la producción agrícola.""
5.- Oportunidades de networking y desarrollo profesional (10.4%): permiten la interacción con otros investigadores, instituciones y empresas, lo que facilita el desarrollo profesional y la creación de redes. Asi lo expresaron algunos los colaboradores de la red de investigación;
""Estar en la red, permite poder relacionarse con otros investigadores, conocer empresas u organizaciones con temas relacionados.""
""Colaborar con otros actores permite adquirir experiencias y generar innovaciones."" ""Colaborar con una institución tan prestigiosa como el CIMMYT te abre oportunidades de trabajo con otras instituciones.""
1.4. Conclusión
La Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica se caracteriza como una red en desarrollo. Esta red, está situada en una gran diversidad de ambientes agroecológicos que incluye la interacción con los módulos y áreas de extensión. Esto favorece la poca centralización de la red, haciéndola menos vulnerable a la fragmentación y con características hacia la maduración. Sin embargo, se requiere fortalecer su flujo de comunicación entre los actores (incrementar su densidad), además de impulsar la relación con otros actores clave de las estructuras del hub (incrementar su diversidad) para solventar problemas sobre falta de difusión, extensión y acceso y disponibilidad de recursos. Todo esto ayudaría a impulsar las acciones de innovación dentro de los hubs a largo plazo.

Mapeo de la Red Latinoamericana de Investigación Agronómica: interacciones y consolidación en el contexto de los nodos de innovación
1.1. Introducción
La Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica (RedAgAl) integrada por investigadores de México, Guatemala, Honduras y Colombia llevan a cabo investigación participativa para mejorar los sistemas de producción de maíz, trigo y frijol (Fig. 1). Muchos de ellos son responsables de plataformas de investigación. Las plataformas de investigación forman parte de la estructura física de los nodos de innovación en el CIMMYT. Estos son espacios de investigación para promover sistemas agroalimentarios sostenibles que abordan desafíos ambientales, agrícolas globales y de seguridad alimentaria. La investigación, desarrollo y extensión se lleva a cabo en colaboración con los actores locales, incluyendo científicos, académicos, técnicos, agricultores y otros actores clave. Esta vinculación desde un inicio aumenta la posibilidad de generar mayor impacto. De esta manera la co-creación de conocimientos es un proceso colaborativo lo que resulta en el desarrollo de conocimientos y soluciones que de otro modo no se alcanzarían de forma independiente.

En este sentido es importante reducir las brechas de cooperación entre los agricultores e investigadores y otros actores clave a través de enlazar colaboraciones y enfoques entre el
conocimiento formal —investigación científica— e informal —tradicional o local de los agricultores. Por esta razón es importante conocer quien en la red interactúa con quien y sobre qué temas, y también indicar a quien más podríamos incluir en la red. Además de identificar las áreas de oportunidad para el fortalecimiento de estas relaciones. Es por esta razón que se realizó un estudio sobre el mapeo de actores en la Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica para llevar a cabo acciones estratégicas que fortalezcan la interacción y consolidación de dicha red en el contexto de los nodos de innovación.
1.2. Materiales y métodos
El estudio se realizó en los nodos de innovación de México, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia y Perú. Durante 2024 se hicieron entrevistas semiestructuradas a los colaboradores involucrados en la Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica. Para esto se implementó la metodología de redes de innovación (Clark, 2006; Rendón et al, 2007). Se usó un muestreo dirigido para identificar 61 actores a entrevistar (Aguilar et al., 2007). La información colectada se derivó de preguntas como: ¿Con quién te relacionas para actividades concernientes con las plataformas de investigación?, ¿Qué actividades o prácticas relacionadas con la plataforma realizan juntos?, ¿Desde qué año?, y ¿Cuáles son los tres principales retos de hacer investigación y extensión? Con esta información se calcularon y graficaron los indicadores de la red — cobertura, centralización y diversidad— y la identificación de los actores clave —articulador, colector y fuente—. Se analizaron los datos colectados usando los Software UCINET 6.288, Netdraw© y KeyPlayer2.
Analizar las propiedades de la red como la densidad y centralización dará una idea de cómo se concentra la información y/o toma de decisiones. Una red muy centralizada —100% es altamente concentrada — evidencia a pocos actores controlando la información, dependiendo de los objetivos, esto puede ser favorable o no. La densidad mostrará el porcentaje de relaciones existentes de las posibles en la red. Una alta densidad puede indicar un amplio acceso de los actores a la información disponible en la red. Identificar la fortaleza de los vínculos puede reflejar el tiempo, intensidad emocional, confianza y reciprocidad que hay entre los actores (Rendón et al., 2007). Por otra parte, el análisis estructural de la red se refiere al rol e influencia de los actores dentro de esta. En este estudio se analizan los actores articuladores, fuente y colectores. Los articuladores son el puente entre uno o varios grupos de actores y tienen la función de enlazar y promover los flujos de información, su eliminación provocaría ruptura de la red. Los actores fuente son aquellos que transmiten información, a través de la validación y filtración por lo que también pueden suprimir información. Los actores colectores son sensibles a experimentar e innovar porque buscan información de la red para implementar.
1.3. Resultados y discusión
1.3.1. Actores de la Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica y actividades implementadas
La Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica se integra de 184 actores y la cobertura territorial incluye México (84.2%), Honduras (4.3%), Guatemala (3.8), Colombia (2.7%), Estados Unidos (2.7%) y Perú (2.2%) (Fig. 2). Los tipos de actores son centros de enseñanza e investigación (58.2%), organizaciones de productores (12%), instituciones de gobierno (11.4%), prestadores de servicios profesionales (9.2%), funciones múltiples (4.3%), empresa rural (productores) (2.2%) y otros con menos del 2% (Figura 3). No obstante que hay varios tipos de actores, la diversidad es baja (-0.95 E-I Index) por lo tanto es una red homofílica, puesto que la mayoría de los actores pertenecen a centros de investigación o a la academia.

Los actores de la red hacen actividades relacionadas con la investigación (58.9%), el extensionismo (16.9%) y 24.2% ambos (investigación y extensión). En el contexto de productores tanto de autoconsumo y comercial (57.4%), seguido de únicamente comercial (23.0%) y de autoconsumo (19.7%). Los principales cultivos estudiados son maíz (55.2%), frijol (19.4%), trigo (14.9%) y otros (10.4%; cebada, sorgo, alfalfa, arroz, café, pitahaya, mango, mango, durazno, chile, forrajes). Las semillas mejoradas son las más usadas en la red (50%), seguido de la interacción de sistemas donde usan semillas tanto mejoradas como nativas (37.5%) y solo el 12.5% trabaja con variedades nativas. El régimen hídrico donde hay oportunidad de trabajar en siembras tanto en riego como de temporal es el más usado (40%), seguido de condiciones de temporal (37.5) y riego (22.5%).
Los principales temas de investigación se relacionan con prácticas de conservación de suelo (16.2%), fertilidad (12.3%), diversificación de cultivos (11.8%), manejo integrado de plagas (8.3%), uso de variedades adecuadas (7.8%), prácticas de conservación de agua (7.4%), manejo integrado de malezas (6.4%), siembra (6.4%), preparación del terreno (5.4%) y otros (menos de 5%; cosecha y poscosecha, mecanización inteligente, manejo integrado de enfermedades, agricultura digital agricultura de precisión, acceso a mercados, inclusión social, producción animal y cultivos de cobertura).
Los retos que los actores de la red enfrentan para hacer investigación y extensión se clasifican en nueve temas (Tabla 1); sin embargo, los más recurrentes están relacionados con el acceso y disponibilidad de recursos (económicos y técnicos) (24.5%), capacitación y transferencia de conocimiento (21.1%), cambio climático (13.6%) y otros.

1.3.2. Caracterización de la red de actores
Respecto a los atributos de la red, el porcentaje en el que los miembros de la red se relacionan y comunican es bajo (0.01% de densidad), esto significa que las conexiones entre los miembros son cerca de ser nulas, probablemente debido a la dispersión geográfica de los actores o la especificidad de los contextos territoriales, por lo que la capacidad para acceder a la red de forma estratégica es baja. Sobre las relaciones que hay entre los actores; los actores dicen mantener más relaciones con otros actores — flechas hacia afuera— (10.7%) de lo que otros actores refieren mantener con un actor —flechas hacia adentro— (0.7%). La fuerza de los vínculos es intermedia; hay colaboraciones que comenzaron desde 1996, pero en 2017 es el año donde más personas (24.6%) indicaron haber iniciado una colaboración con otros actores de la red (Figura 4).

Figura 4. Porcentaje de inicio de colaboraciones entre los actores de la red de plataformas de investigación de 1996 a 2024.
Por lo que es necesario emprender acciones que mejoren la densidad de la red. Algunas intervenciones que pueden favorecer la interacción y el flujo de información son: grupos de foros en redes sociales, giras de intercambio, días de campo, reuniones de grupo, ferias e implementación de redes de ensayos con temas similares de investigación en los diferentes hubs.
El índice de centralización es bajo (10.8%), esto significa que no hay un actor o grupo de actores que controlen o influyan de manera significativa la toma de decisiones o de información dentro de la red. En algunos casos tener estructuras multicéntricas, sin el dominio de un actor, pueden considerarse redes que tienden rápidamente a la madurez. Debido a que hay menos posibilidad de fragmentación de la red, si un actor desaparece. Sin embargo, es importante identificar los actores clave para derivar acciones de forma estratégica en múltiples grupos y hacer llegar la información e impacto deseado.
Se identificaron los actores clave de la red —estructurales, fuentes y articuladores — con base a su posición, roles e influencia en los diferentes actores. El número de actores seleccionados depende de la capacidad de recursos del proyecto y la eficiencia de impacto sobre la red — considerando el impacto en la red si se removieran—, por lo que el número de actores se estableció entre cinco o seis.
Se identificó que cuatro de los cinco actores articuladores — nodos puente que enlazan a dos o más grupos— pertenecen al staff de CIMMYT; IE05, IE11, IE21, IE22 y un actor a Oaxaca, IE27, remover estos 5 nodos causaría una fragmentación del 43.1 % de la red (Figura 4).

la red es un papel importante para entender quién podría apoyar la difusión de la información. En este caso se seleccionó cinco actores fuente — nodos origen o proveedor de información que son altamente referenciados por los actores de la red — que resultaron en el máximo porcentaje de acceso a la red (88.1%) y son los actores IE11, IE21 —staff CIMMYT—, IE28, OR2 y PS09 y PS11—colaboradores en México—. Los actores que buscan más información en la red y pueden llegar al 20.9% son IE48, IE20 —staff CIMMYT—, FM01, FM02, IE47, y PF01 —colaboradores en México— (Figura 5).

1.3.3. Percepción de los actores sobre la red de plataformas de investigación
Sobre el punto de vista que tienen los actores de la red acerca de las plataformas de investigación, hay una visión mayormente positiva sobre las plataformas, pero también destacan áreas clave de mejora, especialmente en la divulgación de los resultados y su aplicación directa para los productores. En seguida cinco categorías que reflejan aspectos clave de su valoración.
1. Valoración positiva de las plataformas de investigación: Son espacios para la investigación, capacitación y transferencia de tecnología. Así lo comentaron los colaboradores;
""Es un buen espacio para capacitación a estudiantes y productores, transferencia de tecnología y para realizar investigación.""
""Son indispensables para la generación de conocimiento.""
""Es un espacio muy valioso para el intercambio de experiencias en investigación.""
""Representan una gran oportunidad para adquirir conocimientos con bases sólidas de investigación.""
""Es un excelente espacio para compartir investigaciones y resultados obtenidos de cada región.""
Generación de conocimiento y colaboración:
""Son estructuras donde nos permite evaluar diferentes escenarios en la producción de granos básicos.""

""Se tienen buenos resultados en la red de plataformas.""
2. Necesidad de mejora y expansión:
• Mayor divulgación y comunicación:
""Hace falta mayor divulgación de las actividades e investigaciones.""
""La información obtenida es valiosa para el escalamiento de tecnologías, pero aún no ha permeado en los productores.""
• Ampliación y fortalecimiento de la red:
""Es numerosa y se necesita seguir sumando colaboradores.""
""Es una buena red, requiere nuevas plataformas para considerar la mayoría de los ambientes de producción.""
""Se requiere de mejores mecanismos para transmitir mejor los resultados hacia los productores.""
• Mejor integración y colaboración interinstitucional:
""Es necesario mantener mayor vinculación entre plataformas.""
3. Impacto en la resolución de problemas locales:
• Aplicación de la investigación a problemas específicos:
""Son importantes y valiosas porque permiten avanzar en la investigación dirigida a resolver las problemáticas regionales.""
""La red de plataformas de investigación es necesaria para coadyuvar en la solución de problemas actuales, como la degradación del suelo, el cambio climático y la mejora de la rentabilidad.""
""Algunas alternativas validadas en otras plataformas han ayudado a resolver la
problemática local.""
• Diversidad geográfica y agroecológica:
""Considero que existe una gran diversidad de zonas agroecológicas, por lo que tener plataformas en cada una de ellas resulta una oportunidad para responder a problemáticas
locales.""
4. Reconocimiento y apreciación de la red:
• Valoración de la metodología y los resultados:
""Es una iniciativa que contempla una metodología innovadora para la generación de datos, introducción de nuevas especies, y generación de capacidades técnicas.""
""Excelente iniciativa para dar respuesta a problemas reales de la producción agrícola.""
• Colaboración entre investigadores:
""Se ha consolidado como un apoyo entre investigadores a nivel nacional.""
""Buenos resultados cuando se cuenta con colaboradores comprometidos.""

5. Críticas sobre la permeabilidad hacia los productores:
• Dificultades para llegar a los productores:
""Si bien en las plataformas se hace investigación de calidad, el conocimiento generado no ha permeado en los productores de la zona de influencia.""
""La mayoría de la información es valiosa, pero falta que los productores la adopten.""
Además de consultar la opinión de los actores sobre las plataformas de investigación, tambien se analizó el valor de pertenecer a la red de plataformas. Donde se destacó la percepción sobre el respaldo que los actores tienen para acceder a información, la colaboración multidisciplinaria, y la capacitación y transferencia de conocimientos como los principales beneficios.
1.-Acceso a información y conocimiento (35.8%): la red de plataformas ofrece acceso a información de calidad, investigaciones innovadoras y resultados valiosos que se pueden aplicar localmente. Así lo comentaron los colaboradores:
""Acceder a información de primera mano que genera el CIMMYT.""
""Obtener y compartir información validada y útil para regiones específicas.""
""Conocer los resultados de investigación, las innovaciones, tener el contacto para solventar dudas”. 2.- Colaboración y vinculación (28.4%): la colaboración con actores clave como el CIMMYT, otros investigadores, técnicos y productores es fundamental para resolver problemas agrícolas y avanzar en la investigación. De esta forma lo expresaron algunos actores de la red;
""La generación de nuevo conocimiento para transferir a los productores.""
""Información regional, específica para la toma de decisiones.""
""La vinculación y colaboración con otras plataformas facilita el intercambio de técnicas y estrategias."" 3.- Capacitación y formación (13.4%): las plataformas brindan espacios para capacitar a estudiantes y productores, así como para fortalecer capacidades técnicas y transferir conocimiento. Así lo dijeron algunos entrevistados;
""Es posible compartir, conocer y adaptar técnicas y estrategias que implementan otros actores de la red."" ""Poder ser partícipe del establecimiento de nuevas técnicas para desarrollar la agricultura en el Estado de Sinaloa.""
4.- Impacto local y aplicación práctica (11.9%): las plataformas contribuyen directamente a resolver problemas locales y mejorar la producción agrícola mediante el intercambio de experiencias y la implementación de innovaciones. De esta forma lo expresaron algunos actores de la red;
""Somos el socio implementador en la región que nos permite iniciar, probar, innovar y generar conocimientos de la mano del productor.""
""El Oriente de Guatemala se convierte en el granero del país, y la visión es promover la agricultura de innovación.""

""El acceso a información y resultados de investigación es vital para mejorar la producción de maíz en la región.""
""Colaborar con otros actores contribuye a eficientizar la producción agrícola.""
5.- Oportunidades de networking y desarrollo profesional (10.4%): permiten la interacción con otros investigadores, instituciones y empresas, lo que facilita el desarrollo profesional y la creación de redes. Asi lo expresaron algunos los colaboradores de la red de investigación;
""Estar en la red, permite poder relacionarse con otros investigadores, conocer empresas u organizaciones con temas relacionados.""
""Colaborar con otros actores permite adquirir experiencias y generar innovaciones."" ""Colaborar con una institución tan prestigiosa como el CIMMYT te abre oportunidades de trabajo con otras instituciones.""
1.4. Conclusión
La Red Latinoamericana de Investigación agronómica se caracteriza como una red en desarrollo. Esta red, está situada en una gran diversidad de ambientes agroecológicos que incluye la interacción con los módulos y áreas de extensión. Esto favorece la poca centralización de la red, haciéndola menos vulnerable a la fragmentación y con características hacia la maduración. Sin embargo, se requiere fortalecer su flujo de comunicación entre los actores (incrementar su densidad), además de impulsar la relación con otros actores clave de las estructuras del hub (incrementar su diversidad) para solventar problemas sobre falta de difusión, extensión y acceso y disponibilidad de recursos. Todo esto ayudaría a impulsar las acciones de innovación dentro de los hubs a largo plazo.

Executive Summary
This study investigates the willingness to pay (WTP) of smallholder farmers in Senegal for various agricultural technologies and practices, including drip irrigation kits, climate information services (CIS), and integrated soil fertility management (ISFM). It also explores the impact of information on awareness levels and WTP.
An experiment on WTP was conducted in the Sedhiou and Tambacounda regions, involving 841 participating farmers. Participants were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Within each group, participants bid on various drip irrigation kits, some with mulching components and some without. Additionally, bids were made on CIS and various ISFM technologies. The control group received standard information describing the products or technologies, while the treatment group received additional information detailing benefits such as usage instructions, efficiency, convenience, labor costs, maintenance requirements, loss reduction, and crop yield improvements.
Key Findings:
• Information Matters: Providing women farmers with additional information on usage instructions, efficiency, convenience, labor costs, maintenance requirements, loss reduction, and crop yield improvement significantly increases their awareness levels.
• Kit Preferences: Farmers, especially older women, prefer smaller drip irrigation kits for use in home garden (Kit 1).
• Mulch as a Complement: While mulch application slightly reduces overall WTP for drip irrigation kits, it significantly increases interest in the home garden kit, indicating its perceived value as a complementary practice.
• WTP for Technologies: Farmers exhibit varying WTP for different ISFM components and CIS SMS packages, with notable average bidding prices indicating affordability and potential effectiveness.
• Awareness and WTP: Higher awareness levels correlate with a higher WTP for ISFM and CIS technologies, highlighting the role of information in technology adoption.
Recommendations:
• Targeted Training: Provide training on drip irrigation systems, emphasizing corresponding benefits for women farmers to capitalize on their increased awareness.
• Promote Kit 1: Focus promotional efforts on the micro drip irrigation kit for home garden, highlighting its benefits and enhanced potential when complemented with use of organic mulch.
• Facilitate Technology Access: Ensure access to affordable bouquet of drip irrigation kits, organic manure, and improved seeds, which farmers expressed WTP. Explore subsidies, incentives, or other support programs for wider accessibility.
• Information Dissemination: Increase awareness of benefit associated with CIS and ISFM practices through farmers education platforms leveraging on the link between awareness and WTP.
• Market Efficiency:

1. Introduction
Behavioural tendencies influence individuals' decision-making processes, as they evaluate potential outcomes based on past experiences (Tversky & Kahneman, 2019). A research study by Tversky & Kahneman, (2019) indicates that consumer utility plays a pivotal role in determining demand for various goods and services across different contexts, including technology adoption, housing demand estimation, labor supply, and food choices(Tversky & Kahneman, 2019).
The concept of individual utility comprises two key components: consumption utility and gain or loss utility (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Consumption utility elucidates how individuals derive satisfaction from consuming goods or services, which inherently shapes their choices as consumers. Conversely, gain or loss utility factors in both current and future utility. Prospect theory highlights that individuals often exhibit a stronger aversion to losses than attraction to gains when making decisions. Consequently, the valuation of gains and losses differs, influencing decision-making processes.
Price determination poses a significant challenge for companies globally, given its profound impact on profitability (Helmold, 2022) . Optimal pricing strategies are crucial management decisions, as they directly affect profitability, surpassing the effects of cost reductions and sales volume increases (Moorthy, 1988). It's assumed that rational consumers maximize utility within certain constraints, such as budget limitations, adjusting consumption accordingly. Effective decision-making hinges on accurately estimating consumers' WTP for various goods and services (Scholz et al., 2015).
However, discerning consumers' true WTP poses a challenge, as it's an abstract construct (Voelckner, 2006). Thus, eliciting this value accurately necessitates valid measurement methods, despite inherent complexities and associated costs (Chung & Rao, 2003). Providing information to farmers or consumers serves as a crucial input in estimating sales and gauging the value they place on goods.
Without a clear understanding of consumers' WTP, designing profitable products and making informed decisions about their market becomes exceedingly challenging (Chung & Rao, 2003). The interplay between price and demand underscores the importance of accurately gauging consumers' WTP, as even minor price adjustments can significantly influence market share and profits (Helmold, 2022). Therefore, knowing consumers' true WTP is paramount for estimating sales and maximizing revenue potential for different products.
This study centres on WTP and pricing for irrigation kits, climate information services (CIS), and integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices. The specific focus is on introducing smaller irrigation kit bouquet to farmers who have already been exposed to a complex borehole irrigation infrastructure. This is achieved by employing a hypothetical elicitation method, where we integrate the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) (Becker et al., 1964) mechanism into our experimental setup. Additionally, we evaluate effect of providing information on farmers' WTP for different technologies.

2. Methodology
2.1 Sampling
The WTP study was conducted in Sedhiou and Tambacounda regions of Senegal, each characterized by distinct climates and farming systems. Sedhiou, located in the Casamance area, has a tropical savanna climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons, while Tambacounda, in the Sahelian area, has hot, dry weather with one major rainy season (Muriithi et al., 2023, 2024).
A total of 841 smallholder farmers were sampled using an equivalence design (Flight & Julious, 2016; Tang et al., 2002) , randomly assigning them to control or treatment groups. In the control group, respondents (447 farmers) were given standard information while respondents in the treatment group (394 farmers) received standard information plus additional benefit information. Both respondents in the control and treatment groups were presented with the experiment to make their bids individually. Figure 1 presents a graphical presentation of how the farmers made their bids for the different technologies. The standard and additional beneficial information read to the control and treatment respondents is presented in Appendix 1.

.
To ensure a representative sample, we employed a multistage sampling strategy, selecting regions, departments, primary sampling units (PSUs), households, and individual farmers. Eligible households were either engaged in irrigation or rainfed farming, with target individuals being women aged 35 and above, youth aged 18-34, or men over 18 years. For multiple eligible individuals in a household, we employed random selection methods such as coin toss or paper numbering and folding. In total, 447 respondents were interviewed in the controls group, 246 farmers in Tambacounda and 201 farmers in Sedhiou; and 394 farmers in the treatment groups, 159 from Sedhiou and 235 farmers in Tambacounda regions. Figure 2 shows graphical distribution of the respondent in the two regions.

Awareness
2.2 Awareness
Additionally, as a second objective the study seeks to assess how provision of additional information on the agricultural technologies and practices affects farmers’ WTP. To achieve this, we administered eleven questions to farmers both before and after training sessions, scoring their responses based on correctness. Each correct answer carries a weight of one point (LaRiviere et al., 2014; Needham et al., 2018). The questions cover various aspects including understanding on irrigation and farming practices and technologies. These questions are presented in Appendix 2. By comparing the pre- and post-training scores, we gauge the effectiveness of the information intervention.
The calculation of the awareness score involves a straightforward process, outlined by the equations below, which delineate how to determine the awareness level (indicative) based on the number of correct answers provided.

2.3 WTP of Drip Kits and ISFM
to the aim of the study was to determine farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) and demand for various technologies and practices, considering social, economic, and behavioural factors. This experiment is valuable for developing a farmer- and market-centric business model.
To assess farmers’ WTP, each farmer took part in two bidding rounds. In the initial round, they bid on different drip irrigation kits outlined in the Table 1 below. The objective was to provide essential information and highlight key components of each kit being presented to the farmer. This information was shared with all farmers as part of the project’s initiative to enhance soil fertility management, water efficiency, labour productivity, and overall productivity.

Table 1 Summary of the drip irrigation kits presented to the farmers.
Consider a scenario of how different technologies can be combined to form a system of irrigation (with either locally available materials or market materials). A kit is a comprehensive package that include all the necessary component and equipment for setting up a drip irrigation system.
A kit comprises of pump or pressurized water source, water filters, backwash controller, pressure control valve, distribution lines (1 drip per bed), meters, hand-operated or electronic control block valves, tubes, fittings, and accessories, emitting devices, and chemical injectors.

In the second level, farmers bid on climate information services, integrated soil fertility management practices, and irrigation technologies, which encompass: (i) Climate Information Services (CIS) for 1 SMS package and (ii) Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) practices, comprising: a. Application of organic manure (1 animal cart), b. Urea Fertilizer usage (50 kg bag), c. Utilization of 1 KG improved seeds (for rice), and d. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) using 1 litre of biopesticides (locally made or market based). Figure 4 shows a summary of how a farmer was randomly assigned to either receive standard information only (control) or receive standard plus benefit information (treatment) and subsequently bid for CIS and ISFM technologies.

3. Results
3.1 Descriptive results
The descriptive analysis Table 2 highlights key findings regarding the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers in control and treatment group categories. The treatment group has a significantly higher proportion of male participants compared to the control group (p = 0.025), and a disparity in household size is evident between the two groups (p = 0.021), with the treatment group having slightly fewer members. Additionally, the control group has a greater number of working female household members compared to the treatment group (p = 0.003). However, variables such as respondent age, farming experience, education level, household wealth index quintiles, and land ownership do not differ significantly between the groups, indicating a balanced sampling approach (Table 2).

Effect of information on awareness level
Assessing changes in awareness level after exposure to specific information is essential for gauging respondents' understanding of the context. Before the experiment, both control and treatment groups of farmers initially possessed similar awareness levels (Figure 5).
For control farmers, there was a significant difference in awareness levels before and after exposure to standard information (p-value = 0.004). Similarly, for treatment farmers there was a significant difference in awareness levels before and after exposure to standard information plus benefits (p-value = 1.8e-05). On average, the awareness scores of the treatment group were higher compared to both treatment farmers before the intervention and the control farmers before and after the intervention (Figure 5).

Figure 6 offers a breakdown of awareness levels based on gender and age demographics among farmers, shedding light on additional insights regarding the extra benefit information received by treatment farmers.
Within the control group, there were no significant differences in awareness levels before and after exposure to information for female and male youths (aged 18 to 34). Similarly, awareness levels among female farmers aged 35 and above did not significantly change before and after exposure to standard information, nor did those of older male farmers (Figure 6).
For treatment farmers, there were notable differences in awareness levels among young women (aged 18 to 34) which significantly increased from 6.3 before exposure to 6.9 after exposure. Similarly, older women (aged 35 and above) saw a significant increase in awareness levels from 6.4 before exposure to 7.1 after exposure. However, both young and older men had no significant differences in awareness levels before and after receiving this information (Figure 6).

Utilizing a mixed modelling approach, we analyse awareness levels by examining the influence of time and treatment on the change in awareness levels. In the mixed model estimation, it exhibits lower variance unexplained by fixed effects (0.82) compared to the regular model (1.04). The variance between groups, identified by ""consent_sid"" remains consistent around 2.6 for both models. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) slightly increases in the robust model (0.76) relative to the regular one (0.72). With 840
16
groups analysed and 1682 data points used, marginal R² slightly decreases (0.013), while conditional R² increases (0.758) in the robust model versus the regular one (0.016 / 0.720) as shown in Table 3.
The average awareness level, not considering time and treatment (when controlled factors are equal to zero) is 6.59 (intercept) and 6.71 for robust mixed models, with significance suggesting potential impact from unobserved factors. The effect of time post-intervention versus pre-intervention on awareness level is significant (p-value <0.001), indicating a significant increase from 6.71 to 7.04 post-intervention (Table 3).
Assessing the heterogenous effects reveals how treatment given time affects awareness levels. The question arises: ""how does the change in awareness level over time differ between treatment and control groups?"" This effect is significant in both normal and robust models. Overall, farmers' awareness levels increase over time, with a positive and significant main effect coefficient of 0.18 robust model and 0.27 in the normal model (Table 3).

Figure 7 illustrates the actual change in awareness levels by accounting for differences between post and pre-training awareness scores. The change in awareness score spans from -3 to 9. A higher value suggests that farmers scored more at the end of the training than at the beginning. However, it's important to note that this difference doesn't address confounding factors estimation, making this measure indicative rather than reflective of actual impact. Nonetheless, the short time gap between pre- and post-training
17
awareness level assessments reduces the likelihood of other factors influencing awareness aside from the training itself.

3.3 Bids and Demand Curves
3.3.1 Drip Irrigation Kit
3.3.1.1 Preferences
Figure 8 shows farmers' preferences for drip irrigation kits. Kit 5 emerged as the preferred choice across various gender and age groups. Overall, 63% of both young and older men favour Kit 5. However, young men (aged 18 to 34) show less preference (6%) for the home garden irrigation kit (Kit 1). Conversely, young women (aged 18 to 34) demonstrate a higher preference (58%) for Kit 5 compared to older women (35 years and above) at 54%. Interestingly, older women express a higher preference for the home garden kit (17%) compared to young women (16%) (Figure 8).

Employing pairwise comparison proved instrumental in simplifying and refining farmers decision-making processes, particularly when confronted with multiple options. This adaptable technique assists in streamlining complex choices, mitigating bias, and providing a structured framework for decision-making. The examination of pairwise comparisons unveiled statistically significant preferences (adjusted p-value < 0.05): farmers prefer home garden kits (Kit 1) over small kits (Kit 3) (p=0.0216) and over large kits (Kit 5) (p=0.0216). These findings suggest a general preference for the home garden kit size (kit 1) compared to both kit 3 an","Farmers’ preferences and willingness to pay for sustainable agricultural practices, in rural Senegal.

Executive Summary
This study investigates the willingness to pay (WTP) of smallholder farmers in Senegal for various agricultural technologies and practices, including drip irrigation kits, climate information services (CIS), and integrated soil fertility management (ISFM). It also explores the impact of information on awareness levels and WTP.
An experiment on WTP was conducted in the Sedhiou and Tambacounda regions, involving 841 participating farmers. Participants were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Within each group, participants bid on various drip irrigation kits, some with mulching components and some without. Additionally, bids were made on CIS and various ISFM technologies. The control group received standard information describing the products or technologies, while the treatment group received additional information detailing benefits such as usage instructions, efficiency, convenience, labor costs, maintenance requirements, loss reduction, and crop yield improvements.
Key Findings:
• Information Matters: Providing women farmers with additional information on usage instructions, efficiency, convenience, labor costs, maintenance requirements, loss reduction, and crop yield improvement significantly increases their awareness levels.
• Kit Preferences: Farmers, especially older women, prefer smaller drip irrigation kits for use in home garden (Kit 1).
• Mulch as a Complement: While mulch application slightly reduces overall WTP for drip irrigation kits, it significantly increases interest in the home garden kit, indicating its perceived value as a complementary practice.
• WTP for Technologies: Farmers exhibit varying WTP for different ISFM components and CIS SMS packages, with notable average bidding prices indicating affordability and potential effectiveness.
• Awareness and WTP: Higher awareness levels correlate with a higher WTP for ISFM and CIS technologies, highlighting the role of information in technology adoption.
Recommendations:
• Targeted Training: Provide training on drip irrigation systems, emphasizing corresponding benefits for women farmers to capitalize on their increased awareness.
• Promote Kit 1: Focus promotional efforts on the micro drip irrigation kit for home garden, highlighting its benefits and enhanced potential when complemented with use of organic mulch.
• Facilitate Technology Access: Ensure access to affordable bouquet of drip irrigation kits, organic manure, and improved seeds, which farmers expressed WTP. Explore subsidies, incentives, or other support programs for wider accessibility.
• Information Dissemination: Increase awareness of benefit associated with CIS and ISFM practices through farmers education platforms leveraging on the link between awareness and WTP.
• Market Efficiency:

1. Introduction
Behavioural tendencies influence individuals' decision-making processes, as they evaluate potential outcomes based on past experiences (Tversky & Kahneman, 2019). A research study by Tversky & Kahneman, (2019) indicates that consumer utility plays a pivotal role in determining demand for various goods and services across different contexts, including technology adoption, housing demand estimation, labor supply, and food choices(Tversky & Kahneman, 2019).
The concept of individual utility comprises two key components: consumption utility and gain or loss utility (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Consumption utility elucidates how individuals derive satisfaction from consuming goods or services, which inherently shapes their choices as consumers. Conversely, gain or loss utility factors in both current and future utility. Prospect theory highlights that individuals often exhibit a stronger aversion to losses than attraction to gains when making decisions. Consequently, the valuation of gains and losses differs, influencing decision-making processes.
Price determination poses a significant challenge for companies globally, given its profound impact on profitability (Helmold, 2022) . Optimal pricing strategies are crucial management decisions, as they directly affect profitability, surpassing the effects of cost reductions and sales volume increases (Moorthy, 1988). It's assumed that rational consumers maximize utility within certain constraints, such as budget limitations, adjusting consumption accordingly. Effective decision-making hinges on accurately estimating consumers' WTP for various goods and services (Scholz et al., 2015).
However, discerning consumers' true WTP poses a challenge, as it's an abstract construct (Voelckner, 2006). Thus, eliciting this value accurately necessitates valid measurement methods, despite inherent complexities and associated costs (Chung & Rao, 2003). Providing information to farmers or consumers serves as a crucial input in estimating sales and gauging the value they place on goods.
Without a clear understanding of consumers' WTP, designing profitable products and making informed decisions about their market becomes exceedingly challenging (Chung & Rao, 2003). The interplay between price and demand underscores the importance of accurately gauging consumers' WTP, as even minor price adjustments can significantly influence market share and profits (Helmold, 2022). Therefore, knowing consumers' true WTP is paramount for estimating sales and maximizing revenue potential for different products.
This study centres on WTP and pricing for irrigation kits, climate information services (CIS), and integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices. The specific focus is on introducing smaller irrigation kit bouquet to farmers who have already been exposed to a complex borehole irrigation infrastructure. This is achieved by employing a hypothetical elicitation method, where we integrate the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) (Becker et al., 1964) mechanism into our experimental setup. Additionally, we evaluate effect of providing information on farmers' WTP for different technologies.

2. Methodology
2.1 Sampling
The WTP study was conducted in Sedhiou and Tambacounda regions of Senegal, each characterized by distinct climates and farming systems. Sedhiou, located in the Casamance area, has a tropical savanna climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons, while Tambacounda, in the Sahelian area, has hot, dry weather with one major rainy season (Muriithi et al., 2023, 2024).
A total of 841 smallholder farmers were sampled using an equivalence design (Flight & Julious, 2016; Tang et al., 2002) , randomly assigning them to control or treatment groups. In the control group, respondents (447 farmers) were given standard information while respondents in the treatment group (394 farmers) received standard information plus additional benefit information. Both respondents in the control and treatment groups were presented with the experiment to make their bids individually. Figure 1 presents a graphical presentation of how the farmers made their bids for the different technologies. The standard and additional beneficial information read to the control and treatment respondents is presented in Appendix 1.

.
To ensure a representative sample, we employed a multistage sampling strategy, selecting regions, departments, primary sampling units (PSUs), households, and individual farmers. Eligible households were either engaged in irrigation or rainfed farming, with target individuals being women aged 35 and above, youth aged 18-34, or men over 18 years. For multiple eligible individuals in a household, we employed random selection methods such as coin toss or paper numbering and folding. In total, 447 respondents were interviewed in the controls group, 246 farmers in Tambacounda and 201 farmers in Sedhiou; and 394 farmers in the treatment groups, 159 from Sedhiou and 235 farmers in Tambacounda regions. Figure 2 shows graphical distribution of the respondent in the two regions.

Awareness
2.2 Awareness
Additionally, as a second objective the study seeks to assess how provision of additional information on the agricultural technologies and practices affects farmers’ WTP. To achieve this, we administered eleven questions to farmers both before and after training sessions, scoring their responses based on correctness. Each correct answer carries a weight of one point (LaRiviere et al., 2014; Needham et al., 2018). The questions cover various aspects including understanding on irrigation and farming practices and technologies. These questions are presented in Appendix 2. By comparing the pre- and post-training scores, we gauge the effectiveness of the information intervention.
The calculation of the awareness score involves a straightforward process, outlined by the equations below, which delineate how to determine the awareness level (indicative) based on the number of correct answers provided.

2.3 WTP of Drip Kits and ISFM
to the aim of the study was to determine farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) and demand for various technologies and practices, considering social, economic, and behavioural factors. This experiment is valuable for developing a farmer- and market-centric business model.
To assess farmers’ WTP, each farmer took part in two bidding rounds. In the initial round, they bid on different drip irrigation kits outlined in the Table 1 below. The objective was to provide essential information and highlight key components of each kit being presented to the farmer. This information was shared with all farmers as part of the project’s initiative to enhance soil fertility management, water efficiency, labour productivity, and overall productivity.

Table 1 Summary of the drip irrigation kits presented to the farmers.
Consider a scenario of how different technologies can be combined to form a system of irrigation (with either locally available materials or market materials). A kit is a comprehensive package that include all the necessary component and equipment for setting up a drip irrigation system.
A kit comprises of pump or pressurized water source, water filters, backwash controller, pressure control valve, distribution lines (1 drip per bed), meters, hand-operated or electronic control block valves, tubes, fittings, and accessories, emitting devices, and chemical injectors.

In the second level, farmers bid on climate information services, integrated soil fertility management practices, and irrigation technologies, which encompass: (i) Climate Information Services (CIS) for 1 SMS package and (ii) Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) practices, comprising: a. Application of organic manure (1 animal cart), b. Urea Fertilizer usage (50 kg bag), c. Utilization of 1 KG improved seeds (for rice), and d. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) using 1 litre of biopesticides (locally made or market based). Figure 4 shows a summary of how a farmer was randomly assigned to either receive standard information only (control) or receive standard plus benefit information (treatment) and subsequently bid for CIS and ISFM technologies.

3. Results
3.1 Descriptive results
The descriptive analysis Table 2 highlights key findings regarding the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers in control and treatment group categories. The treatment group has a significantly higher proportion of male participants compared to the control group (p = 0.025), and a disparity in household size is evident between the two groups (p = 0.021), with the treatment group having slightly fewer members. Additionally, the control group has a greater number of working female household members compared to the treatment group (p = 0.003). However, variables such as respondent age, farming experience, education level, household wealth index quintiles, and land ownership do not differ significantly between the groups, indicating a balanced sampling approach (Table 2).

Effect of information on awareness level
Assessing changes in awareness level after exposure to specific information is essential for gauging respondents' understanding of the context. Before the experiment, both control and treatment groups of farmers initially possessed similar awareness levels (Figure 5).
For control farmers, there was a significant difference in awareness levels before and after exposure to standard information (p-value = 0.004). Similarly, for treatment farmers there was a significant difference in awareness levels before and after exposure to standard information plus benefits (p-value = 1.8e-05). On average, the awareness scores of the treatment group were higher compared to both treatment farmers before the intervention and the control farmers before and after the intervention (Figure 5).

Figure 6 offers a breakdown of awareness levels based on gender and age demographics among farmers, shedding light on additional insights regarding the extra benefit information received by treatment farmers.
Within the control group, there were no significant differences in awareness levels before and after exposure to information for female and male youths (aged 18 to 34). Similarly, awareness levels among female farmers aged 35 and above did not significantly change before and after exposure to standard information, nor did those of older male farmers (Figure 6).
For treatment farmers, there were notable differences in awareness levels among young women (aged 18 to 34) which significantly increased from 6.3 before exposure to 6.9 after exposure. Similarly, older women (aged 35 and above) saw a significant increase in awareness levels from 6.4 before exposure to 7.1 after exposure. However, both young and older men had no significant differences in awareness levels before and after receiving this information (Figure 6).

Utilizing a mixed modelling approach, we analyse awareness levels by examining the influence of time and treatment on the change in awareness levels. In the mixed model estimation, it exhibits lower variance unexplained by fixed effects (0.82) compared to the regular model (1.04). The variance between groups, identified by ""consent_sid"" remains consistent around 2.6 for both models. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) slightly increases in the robust model (0.76) relative to the regular one (0.72). With 840
16
groups analysed and 1682 data points used, marginal R² slightly decreases (0.013), while conditional R² increases (0.758) in the robust model versus the regular one (0.016 / 0.720) as shown in Table 3.
The average awareness level, not considering time and treatment (when controlled factors are equal to zero) is 6.59 (intercept) and 6.71 for robust mixed models, with significance suggesting potential impact from unobserved factors. The effect of time post-intervention versus pre-intervention on awareness level is significant (p-value <0.001), indicating a significant increase from 6.71 to 7.04 post-intervention (Table 3).
Assessing the heterogenous effects reveals how treatment given time affects awareness levels. The question arises: ""how does the change in awareness level over time differ between treatment and control groups?"" This effect is significant in both normal and robust models. Overall, farmers' awareness levels increase over time, with a positive and significant main effect coefficient of 0.18 robust model and 0.27 in the normal model (Table 3).

Figure 7 illustrates the actual change in awareness levels by accounting for differences between post and pre-training awareness scores. The change in awareness score spans from -3 to 9. A higher value suggests that farmers scored more at the end of the training than at the beginning. However, it's important to note that this difference doesn't address confounding factors estimation, making this measure indicative rather than reflective of actual impact. Nonetheless, the short time gap between pre- and post-training
17
awareness level assessments reduces the likelihood of other factors influencing awareness aside from the training itself.

3.3.1.1 Preferences
Figure 8 shows farmers' preferences for drip irrigation kits. Kit 5 emerged as the preferred choice across various gender and age groups. Overall, 63% of both young and older men favour Kit 5. However, young men (aged 18 to 34) show less preference (6%) for the home garden irrigation kit (Kit 1). Conversely, young women (aged 18 to 34) demonstrate a higher preference (58%) for Kit 5 compared to older women (35 years and above) at 54%. Interestingly, older women express a higher preference for the home garden kit (17%) compared to young women (16%) (Figure 8).

Employing pairwise comparison proved instrumental in simplifying and refining farmers decision-making processes, particularly when confronted with multiple options. This adaptable technique assists in streamlining complex choices, mitigating bias, and providing a structured framework for decision-making. The examination of pairwise comparisons unveiled statistically significant preferences (adjusted p-value < 0.05): farmers prefer home garden kits (Kit 1) over small kits (Kit 3) (p=0.0216) and over large kits (Kit 5) (p=0.0216). These findings suggest a general preference for the home garden kit size (kit 1) compared to both kit 3 an"

Résumé
Cette étude examine la volonté de payer (WTP) des petits exploitants agricoles au Sénégal pour diverses technologies et pratiques agricoles, y compris les kits d’irrigation goutte à goutte, les services d’information climatique (CIS) et la gestion intégrée de la fertilité des sols (ISFM). Il explore également l’impact de l’information sur les niveaux de sensibilisation et les WTP.
Une Investigation sur la WTP a été menée dans les régions de Sédhiou et de Tambacounda, impliquant 841 agriculteurs participants. Les participants ont été répartis au hasard dans un groupe de traitement ou de contrôle. Au sein de chaque groupe, les participants ont été réparti par kit d’irrigation goutte à goutte, certains pratiquant le paillage et d’autres sans paillage. De plus, des appels d’offres ont été lancés pour des besoins de CIS et diverses technologies d’ ISFM.
Le groupe témoin a reçu des informations standards décrivant les produits ou les technologies, tandis que le groupe de traitement a reçu des informations supplémentaires détaillant les avantages tels que les instructions d’utilisation, l’efficacité, la commodité, les coûts de main-d’œuvre, les exigences d’entretien, la réduction des pertes et l’amélioration du rendement des cultures.
Resultats majeurs:
• L’information est importante: Fournir aux agricultrices des informations supplémentaires sur les instructions d’utilisation, l’efficacité, la commodité, les coûts de main-d’œuvre, les exigences d’entretien, la réduction des pertes et l’amélioration du rendement des cultures augmente considérablement leur niveau de sensibilisation.
• Préférences en matière de kits: Les agriculteurs, en particulier les femmes âgées, préfèrent les kits d’irrigation goutte à goutte plus petits pour une utilisation dans le jardin potager (kit 1).
• Paillage en complément: Bien que l’application du paillage réduit légèrement la WTP globale pour les kits d’irrigation goutte à goutte, elle augmente
6
considérablement l’intérêt pour le kit de jardin potager, ce qui indique que sa valeur est perçue comme une pratique complémentaire.
• WTP pour les technologies: Les agriculteurs présentent des intérêts variables pour les différentes composantes de l’ISFM et les forfaits de package SMS de CIS, avec des prix d’appel d’offres abordables indiquant une efficacité potentielle de ces technologies.
• Sensibilisation et WTP: Des niveaux de sensibilisation plus élevés sont corrélés à un WTP plus élevé pour les technologies ISFM et CIS, ce qui met en évidence le rôle de l’information dans l’adoption de la technologie.
Recommandations:
• Formation ciblée: Offrir une formation sur les systèmes d’irrigation goutte à goutte, en mettant l’accent sur les avantages correspondants pour agricultrices afin de tirer parti de leur sensibilisation accrue. les
• Promouvoir le kit 1: Concentrer les efforts de promotion sur le kit de micro- irrigation goutte à goutte pour le jardin potager, en soulignant ses avantages et son potentiel accru lorsqu’il est complété par l’utilisation de paillage.
• Faciliter l’accès à la technologie: Assurer l’accès à un paquet abordable de kits d’irrigation goutte à goutte, de fumier et de semences améliorées, ce que les agriculteurs ont exprimé en matière de WTP. Explorer les subventions, les incitations ou d’autres programmes de soutien pour une plus grande
accessibilité.
• Diffusion de l’information: Accroître la sensibilisation aux avantages associés aux pratiques de CIS et de l’ISFM par le biais de la plateformes d’innovation des agriculteurs tirant parti du lien entre la sensibilisation et la WTP.
• Efficience du marché:
o Pour les agriculteurs: Concevoir des interventions, des produits adaptés aux besoins spécifiques des agriculteurs, des innovations prometteuses pour une meilleure adoption et une durabilité accrues.
o Pour les fournisseurs d’intrants: Collaborer avec les concepteurs de projets pour comprendre les besoins des agriculteurs et co-concevoir des solutions durables et percutantes.

1. Introduction
Les tendances comportementales influencent les processus de prise de décision des individus, car ils évaluent les résultats potentiels en fonction des expériences passées (Tversky et Kahneman, 2019). Une étude de recherche menée par Tversky et Kahneman (2019) indique que l’utilité du consommateur joue un rôle central dans la détermination de la demande de divers biens et services dans différents contextes, notamment l’adoption de la technologie, l’estimation de la demande de logement, l’offre de main- d’œuvre et les choix alimentaires (Tversky et Kahneman, 2019).
Le concept d’utilité individuelle comprend deux éléments clés: l’utilité de consommation et l’utilité du gain ou de la perte (Kahneman et Tversky, 1979). la
L’utilité de la consommation élucide la façon dont les individus tirent satisfaction de la consommation de biens ou de services, ce qui façonne intrinsèquement leurs choix en tant que consommateurs. À l’inverse, les facteurs d’utilité de gain ou de perte dans l’utilité actuelle et future. La théorie des perspectives met en évidence que les individus manifestent souvent une plus forte aversion pour les pertes que pour les gains lorsqu’ils prennent des decisions. Par conséquent, l’évaluation des gains et des pertes diffère, influençant les processus de prise de décision.
La détermination des prix pose un défi important pour les entreprises du monde entier, compte tenu de son impact profond sur la rentabilité (Helmold, 2022). Les stratégies de tarification optimales sont des décisions de gestion cruciales, car elles affectent directement la rentabilité, dépassant les effets de reduction de coûts et des augmentations du volume des ventes (Moorthy, 1988). On suppose que consommateurs rationnels maximisent l’utilité dans le cadre de certaines contraintes, telles que les limites budgétaires, en ajustant leur consommation en conséquence. Une prise de décision efficace repose sur une estimation précise de la WTP des consommateurs pour divers biens et services (Scholz et al., 2015). les
Cependant, déterminer la véritable WTP des consommateurs pose un défi, car il s'agit d'une construction abstraite (Voelckner, 2006). Ainsi, obtenir cette valeur avec précision
9
nécessite des méthodes de mesures valides, malgré les complexités inhérentes et les coûts associés (Chung et Rao, 2003). Fournir des informations aux agriculteurs ou aux consommateurs constitue un élément crucial pour estimer les ventes et évaluer la valeur qu’ils accordent aux produits.
Sans une compréhension claire de la volonté de payer (WTP) des consommateurs, concevoir des produits rentables et prendre des décisions claires concernant leur marché devient extrêmement difficile (Chung et Rao, 2003). L'interaction entre le prix et la demande souligne l'importance d'évaluer avec précision la volonté de payer des consommateurs, car même des ajustements mineurs des prix peuvent influencer de manière significative la part de marché et les bénéfices (Helmold, 2022). Par conséquent, connaître la véritable WTP des consommateurs est primordiale pour estimer les ventes et maximiser le potentiel de revenus des différents produits.
Cette étude se concentre sur la WTP et la tarification des kits d'irrigation, des services d'information climatique (CIS) et des pratiques de gestion intégrée de la fertilité des sols (ISFM). Un accent spécifique est mis sur l’introduction d’un plus petit kits d’irrigation pour les agriculteurs qui ont déjà été exposés à une infrastructure d’irrigation par forage complexe. Ceci est réalisé en employant une méthode de diversion hypothétique, dans laquelle nous intégrons le mécanisme Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) (Becker et al., 1964) dans notre configuration expérimentale. De plus, nous évaluons l'effet de la fourniture d'informations sur la WTP des agriculteurs pour différentes technologies.

2. Méthodologie
2.1 Échantillonnage
L'étude de la WTP a été menée dans les régions de Sédhiou et Tambacounda au Sénégal, chacune caractérisée par des climats et des systèmes agricoles distincts. Sédhiou est située dans la zone sahélienne, a un climat de savane tropicale avec des saisons humides et sèches prononcées, tandis que Tambacounda est dans la zone sahélienne, a un climat chaud et sec avec une grande saison des pluies (Muriithi et al., 2023, 2024). Au total, 841 petits exploitants agricoles ont été échantillonnés à l'aide d'un plan d'équivalence (Flight & Julious, 2016; Tang et al., 2002), en les assignant au hasard à des groupes de contrôle ou de traitement. Dans le groupe témoin, les répondants (447 agriculteurs) ont reçu des informations standard tandis que les répondants du groupe de traitement (394 agriculteurs) ont reçu des informations standard ainsi que des informations supplémentaires sur les avantages. Les deux répondants des groupes de contrôle et de traitement se sont vus présenter l'expérience pour faire leurs offres individuellement. La figure 1 présente la manière dont les agriculteurs ont fait leurs offres pour les différentes technologies. Les informations bénéfiques standard et supplémentaires lues aux répondants témoins et sous traitement sont présentées à
l’annexe 1.

Figure 1 Résumé de la manière dont les agriculteurs soumissionnent pour les technologies CIS et ISFM
Pour garantir un échantillon représentatif, nous avons utilisé une stratégie d'échantillonnage à plusieurs degrés, en sélectionnant les régions, les départements, les unités d'échantillonnage primaires (PSUs), les ménages et les agriculteurs individuels. Les ménages éligibles pratiquaient soit l'irrigation, soit l'agriculture pluviale, les individus cibles étant les femmes âgées de 35 ans et plus, les jeunes âgés de 18 à 34 ans ou les hommes de plus de 18 ans. Pour plusieurs personnes éligibles dans un ménage, nous 11
avons utilisé des méthodes de sélection aléatoire telles que le tirage au sort ou la numérotation et le pliage du papier. Au total, 447 répondants ont été interrogés dans le groupe témoin, 246 agriculteurs à Tambacounda et 201 agriculteurs à Sédhiou; et 394 agriculteurs dans les groupes de traitement, 159 de Sédhiou et 235 agriculteurs des régions de Tambacounda. La figure 2 montre la répartition des répondants dans les deux régions.

2.2 Sensibilisation
En outre, comme deuxième objectif, l’étude cherche à évaluer dans quelle mesure la fourniture d’informations supplémentaires sur les technologies et les pratiques agricoles affecte la WTP des agriculteurs. Pour y parvenir, nous avons posé onze questions aux agriculteurs avant et après les sessions de formation, notant leurs réponses en fonction de leur exactitude. Chaque bonne réponse compte pour un point (LaRiviere et al., 2014 ; Needham et al., 2018). Les questions couvrent divers aspects, notamment la compréhension des pratiques et technologies d’irrigation et agricoles. Ces questions
12
sont présentées à l'annexe 2. En comparant les scores avant et après la formation, nous évaluons l'efficacité de l'intervention de l’information.
Le calcul du score de notoriété implique un processus simple, décrit par les équations ci-dessous, qui décrivent comment déterminer le niveau de notoriété (indicatif) en fonction du nombre de réponses correctes fournies.
11 Score de sensibilisation𝑖𝑗 = ∑ 𝑥𝑖𝑗 (i) 𝑘=1
Où :
• Score de sensibilisation 𝑖𝑗= score de sensibilisation de l'agriculteur i avant ou après.
𝑥𝑖𝑗 = le score des questions posées aux agriculteurs i avant ou après.

𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (𝐴𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡)𝑖𝑗 = indique le score total des agriculteurs 𝑖 avant la formation
2.3 WTP des kits goutte à goutte et de l’ISFM
L'objectif de l'étude était de déterminer la volonté de payer (WTP) des agriculteurs et la demande pour diverses technologies et pratiques (ISFM), en tenant compte des facteurs sociaux, économiques et comportementaux. Cette expérience est précieuse pour développer un modèle commercial centré sur les agriculteurs et le marché.
Pour évaluer la volonté de payer des agriculteurs, chaque agriculteur a participé à deux tours d’appel d’offres. Lors du premier tour, ils ont soumissionné sur différents kits d'irrigation goutte à goutte décrits dans le tableau 1 ci-dessous. L'objectif était de fournir des informations essentielles et de mettre en évidence les éléments clés de chaque kit présenté à l'agriculteur. Ces informations ont été partagées avec tous les agriculteurs dans le cadre de l’initiative du projet visant à améliorer la gestion de la fertilité des sols, l’efficacité de l’eau, la productivité du travail et la productivité globale

Table 1 Résumé des kits d'irrigation goutte à goutte présentés aux agriculteurs
Considérer un scénario montrant comment différentes technologies peuvent être combinées pour former un système d'irrigation (avec des matériaux disponibles localement ou des matériaux du marché). Un kit est un ensemble complet comprenant tous les composants et équipements nécessaires à la mise en place d’un système d’irrigation goutte à goutte.
Un kit comprend une pompe ou une source d'eau sous pression, des filtres à eau, un contrôleur de lavage à contre-courant, une vanne de régulation de pression, des conduites de distribution (1 goutte à goutte par lit), des compteurs, des vannes de bloc de commande manuelles ou électroniques, des tubes, des raccords et des accessoires, des dispositifs émetteurs, et des injecteurs de produits chimiques.

Au deuxième niveau, les agriculteurs ont soumissionné pour des services d'information climatique, les pratiques de gestion intégrée de la fertilité des sols et les technologies d'irrigation, qui comprennent : (i) les services d'information climatique (CIS) pour 1 package SMS et (ii) les pratiques de gestion intégrée de la fertilité des sols (ISFM),
15
comprenant : (i) Application de fumier organique (1 charrette à animaux), (ii) Utilisation de l’engrais urée (sac de 50 kg), (iii) Utilisation de 1 kg de semences améliorées (pour le riz) ; (iv) Lutte intégrée contre les bioagresseurs (IPM) utilisant 1 litre de biopesticides (fabriqué localement ou issus du marché).
La figure 4 montre un résumé de la façon dont un agriculteur a été assigné au hasard soit pour recevoir des informations standard uniquement (contrôle), soit pour recevoir des informations standard plus des informations supplémentaires sur les avantages (traitement) et ensuite soumissionner pour les technologies CIS et ISFM.

3. Résultats
3.1 Résultats descriptifs
L'analyse descriptive du tableau 2 met en évidence les principales conclusions concernant les caractéristiques démographiques et socio-économiques des agriculteurs des catégories de groupe témoin et de traitement. Le groupe de traitement compte une proportion significativement plus élevée de participants masculins que le groupe témoin (p = 0,025), et une disparité dans la taille du ménage est évidente entre les deux groupes (p = 0,021), le groupe de traitement comptant légèrement moins de membres. De plus, le groupe témoin compte un plus grand nombre de femmes actives dans le ménage que le groupe de traitement (p = 0,003). Cependant, des variables telles que l'âge des répondants, l'expérience agricole, le niveau d'éducation, les quintiles de l'indice de richesse des ménages et la propriété foncière ne diffèrent pas significativement entre les groupes, ce qui indique une approche d'échantillonnage
équilibrée (Tableau 2).

3.2 Effet de l'information sur le niveau de sensibilisation
L'évaluation des changements sur le niveau de sensibilisation après l'exposition à des informations spécifiques est essentielle pour évaluer la compréhension du contexte par les répondants. Avant l’expérience, les groupes d’agriculteurs témoins et ceux dans le groupe traitement possédaient initialement des niveaux de sensibilisation similaires
18
(Figure 5). Pour les agriculteurs témoins, il existe une différence significative dans les niveaux de sensibilisation avant et après l'exposition aux informations standard (valeur p = 0,004). De même, pour les agriculteurs se trouvant dans le groupe du traitement, il existe une différence significative dans les niveaux de sensibilisation avant et après l'exposition aux informations standard et supplémentaires sur les avantages (valeur p = 1,8e-05). En moyenne, les scores de sensibilisation du groupe de traitement sont plus élevés que ceux des agriculteurs du groupe de traitement avant l'intervention et des agriculteurs témoins avant et après l'intervention (Figure 5).

Résumé
Cette étude examine la volonté de payer (WTP) des petits exploitants agricoles au Sénégal pour diverses technologies et pratiques agricoles, y compris les kits d’irrigation goutte à goutte, les services d’information climatique (CIS) et la gestion intégrée de la fertilité des sols (ISFM). Il explore également l’impact de l’information sur les niveaux de sensibilisation et les WTP.
Une Investigation sur la WTP a été menée dans les régions de Sédhiou et de Tambacounda, impliquant 841 agriculteurs participants. Les participants ont été répartis au hasard dans un groupe de traitement ou de contrôle. Au sein de chaque groupe, les participants ont été réparti par kit d’irrigation goutte à goutte, certains pratiquant le paillage et d’autres sans paillage. De plus, des appels d’offres ont été lancés pour des besoins de CIS et diverses technologies d’ ISFM.
Le groupe témoin a reçu des informations standards décrivant les produits ou les technologies, tandis que le groupe de traitement a reçu des informations supplémentaires détaillant les avantages tels que les instructions d’utilisation, l’efficacité, la commodité, les coûts de main-d’œuvre, les exigences d’entretien, la réduction des pertes et l’amélioration du rendement des cultures.
Resultats majeurs:
• L’information est importante: Fournir aux agricultrices des informations supplémentaires sur les instructions d’utilisation, l’efficacité, la commodité, les coûts de main-d’œuvre, les exigences d’entretien, la réduction des pertes et l’amélioration du rendement des cultures augmente considérablement leur niveau de sensibilisation.
• Préférences en matière de kits: Les agriculteurs, en particulier les femmes âgées, préfèrent les kits d’irrigation goutte à goutte plus petits pour une utilisation dans le jardin potager (kit 1).
• Paillage en complément: Bien que l’application du paillage réduit légèrement la WTP globale pour les kits d’irrigation goutte à goutte, elle augmente
6
considérablement l’intérêt pour le kit de jardin potager, ce qui indique que sa valeur est perçue comme une pratique complémentaire.
• WTP pour les technologies: Les agriculteurs présentent des intérêts variables pour les différentes composantes de l’ISFM et les forfaits de package SMS de CIS, avec des prix d’appel d’offres abordables indiquant une efficacité potentielle de ces technologies.
• Sensibilisation et WTP: Des niveaux de sensibilisation plus élevés sont corrélés à un WTP plus élevé pour les technologies ISFM et CIS, ce qui met en évidence le rôle de l’information dans l’adoption de la technologie.
Recommandations:
• Formation ciblée: Offrir une formation sur les systèmes d’irrigation goutte à goutte, en mettant l’accent sur les avantages correspondants pour agricultrices afin de tirer parti de leur sensibilisation accrue. les
• Promouvoir le kit 1: Concentrer les efforts de promotion sur le kit de micro- irrigation goutte à goutte pour le jardin potager, en soulignant ses avantages et son potentiel accru lorsqu’il est complété par l’utilisation de paillage.
• Faciliter l’accès à la technologie: Assurer l’accès à un paquet abordable de kits d’irrigation goutte à goutte, de fumier et de semences améliorées, ce que les agriculteurs ont exprimé en matière de WTP. Explorer les subventions, les incitations ou d’autres programmes de soutien pour une plus grande
accessibilité.
• Diffusion de l’information: Accroître la sensibilisation aux avantages associés aux pratiques de CIS et de l’ISFM par le biais de la plateformes d’innovation des agriculteurs tirant parti du lien entre la sensibilisation et la WTP.
• Efficience du marché:
o Pour les agriculteurs: Concevoir des interventions, des produits adaptés aux besoins spécifiques des agriculteurs, des innovations prometteuses pour une meilleure adoption et une durabilité accrues.
o Pour les fournisseurs d’intrants: Collaborer avec les concepteurs de projets pour comprendre les besoins des agriculteurs et co-concevoir des solutions durables et percutantes.

1. Introduction
Les tendances comportementales influencent les processus de prise de décision des individus, car ils évaluent les résultats potentiels en fonction des expériences passées (Tversky et Kahneman, 2019). Une étude de recherche menée par Tversky et Kahneman (2019) indique que l’utilité du consommateur joue un rôle central dans la détermination de la demande de divers biens et services dans différents contextes, notamment l’adoption de la technologie, l’estimation de la demande de logement, l’offre de main- d’œuvre et les choix alimentaires (Tversky et Kahneman, 2019).
Le concept d’utilité individuelle comprend deux éléments clés: l’utilité de consommation et l’utilité du gain ou de la perte (Kahneman et Tversky, 1979). la
L’utilité de la consommation élucide la façon dont les individus tirent satisfaction de la consommation de biens ou de services, ce qui façonne intrinsèquement leurs choix en tant que consommateurs. À l’inverse, les facteurs d’utilité de gain ou de perte dans l’utilité actuelle et future. La théorie des perspectives met en évidence que les individus manifestent souvent une plus forte aversion pour les pertes que pour les gains lorsqu’ils prennent des decisions. Par conséquent, l’évaluation des gains et des pertes diffère, influençant les processus de prise de décision.
La détermination des prix pose un défi important pour les entreprises du monde entier, compte tenu de son impact profond sur la rentabilité (Helmold, 2022). Les stratégies de tarification optimales sont des décisions de gestion cruciales, car elles affectent directement la rentabilité, dépassant les effets de reduction de coûts et des augmentations du volume des ventes (Moorthy, 1988). On suppose que consommateurs rationnels maximisent l’utilité dans le cadre de certaines contraintes, telles que les limites budgétaires, en ajustant leur consommation en conséquence. Une prise de décision efficace repose sur une estimation précise de la WTP des consommateurs pour divers biens et services (Scholz et al., 2015). les
Cependant, déterminer la véritable WTP des consommateurs pose un défi, car il s'agit d'une construction abstraite (Voelckner, 2006). Ainsi, obtenir cette valeur avec précision
9
nécessite des méthodes de mesures valides, malgré les complexités inhérentes et les coûts associés (Chung et Rao, 2003). Fournir des informations aux agriculteurs ou aux consommateurs constitue un élément crucial pour estimer les ventes et évaluer la valeur qu’ils accordent aux produits.
Sans une compréhension claire de la volonté de payer (WTP) des consommateurs, concevoir des produits rentables et prendre des décisions claires concernant leur marché devient extrêmement difficile (Chung et Rao, 2003). L'interaction entre le prix et la demande souligne l'importance d'évaluer avec précision la volonté de payer des consommateurs, car même des ajustements mineurs des prix peuvent influencer de manière significative la part de marché et les bénéfices (Helmold, 2022). Par conséquent, connaître la véritable WTP des consommateurs est primordiale pour estimer les ventes et maximiser le potentiel de revenus des différents produits.
Cette étude se concentre sur la WTP et la tarification des kits d'irrigation, des services d'information climatique (CIS) et des pratiques de gestion intégrée de la fertilité des sols (ISFM). Un accent spécifique est mis sur l’introduction d’un plus petit kits d’irrigation pour les agriculteurs qui ont déjà été exposés à une infrastructure d’irrigation par forage complexe. Ceci est réalisé en employant une méthode de diversion hypothétique, dans laquelle nous intégrons le mécanisme Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) (Becker et al., 1964) dans notre configuration expérimentale. De plus, nous évaluons l'effet de la fourniture d'informations sur la WTP des agriculteurs pour différentes technologies.

2. Méthodologie
2.1 Échantillonnage
L'étude de la WTP a été menée dans les régions de Sédhiou et Tambacounda au Sénégal, chacune caractérisée par des climats et des systèmes agricoles distincts. Sédhiou est située dans la zone sahélienne, a un climat de savane tropicale avec des saisons humides et sèches prononcées, tandis que Tambacounda est dans la zone sahélienne, a un climat chaud et sec avec une grande saison des pluies (Muriithi et al., 2023, 2024). Au total, 841 petits exploitants agricoles ont été échantillonnés à l'aide d'un plan d'équivalence (Flight & Julious, 2016; Tang et al., 2002), en les assignant au hasard à des groupes de contrôle ou de traitement. Dans le groupe témoin, les répondants (447 agriculteurs) ont reçu des informations standard tandis que les répondants du groupe de traitement (394 agriculteurs) ont reçu des informations standard ainsi que des informations supplémentaires sur les avantages. Les deux répondants des groupes de contrôle et de traitement se sont vus présenter l'expérience pour faire leurs offres individuellement. La figure 1 présente la manière dont les agriculteurs ont fait leurs offres pour les différentes technologies. Les informations bénéfiques standard et supplémentaires lues aux répondants témoins et sous traitement sont présentées à

Figure 1 Résumé de la manière dont les agriculteurs soumissionnent pour les technologies CIS et ISFM
Pour garantir un échantillon représentatif, nous avons utilisé une stratégie d'échantillonnage à plusieurs degrés, en sélectionnant les régions, les départements, les unités d'échantillonnage primaires (PSUs), les ménages et les agriculteurs individuels. Les ménages éligibles pratiquaient soit l'irrigation, soit l'agriculture pluviale, les individus cibles étant les femmes âgées de 35 ans et plus, les jeunes âgés de 18 à 34 ans ou les hommes de plus de 18 ans. Pour plusieurs personnes éligibles dans un ménage, nous 11
avons utilisé des méthodes de sélection aléatoire telles que le tirage au sort ou la numérotation et le pliage du papier. Au total, 447 répondants ont été interrogés dans le groupe témoin, 246 agriculteurs à Tambacounda et 201 agriculteurs à Sédhiou; et 394 agriculteurs dans les groupes de traitement, 159 de Sédhiou et 235 agriculteurs des régions de Tambacounda. La figure 2 montre la répartition des répondants dans les deux régions.

2.2 Sensibilisation
En outre, comme deuxième objectif, l’étude cherche à évaluer dans quelle mesure la fourniture d’informations supplémentaires sur les technologies et les pratiques agricoles affecte la WTP des agriculteurs. Pour y parvenir, nous avons posé onze questions aux agriculteurs avant et après les sessions de formation, notant leurs réponses en fonction de leur exactitude. Chaque bonne réponse compte pour un point (LaRiviere et al., 2014 ; Needham et al., 2018). Les questions couvrent divers aspects, notamment la compréhension des pratiques et technologies d’irrigation et agricoles. Ces questions
12
sont présentées à l'annexe 2. En comparant les scores avant et après la formation, nous évaluons l'efficacité de l'intervention de l’information.
Le calcul du score de notoriété implique un processus simple, décrit par les équations ci-dessous, qui décrivent comment déterminer le niveau de notoriété (indicatif) en fonction du nombre de réponses correctes fournies.

2.3 WTP des kits goutte à goutte et de l’ISFM
L'objectif de l'étude était de déterminer la volonté de payer (WTP) des agriculteurs et la demande pour diverses technologies et pratiques (ISFM), en tenant compte des facteurs sociaux, économiques et comportementaux. Cette expérience est précieuse pour développer un modèle commercial centré sur les agriculteurs et le marché.
Pour évaluer la volonté de payer des agriculteurs, chaque agriculteur a participé à deux tours d’appel d’offres. Lors du premier tour, ils ont soumissionné sur différents kits d'irrigation goutte à goutte décrits dans le tableau 1 ci-dessous. L'objectif était de fournir des informations essentielles et de mettre en évidence les éléments clés de chaque kit présenté à l'agriculteur. Ces informations ont été partagées avec tous les agriculteurs dans le cadre de l’initiative du projet visant à améliorer la gestion de la fertilité des sols, l’efficacité de l’eau, la productivité du travail et la productivité globale

3.1 Résultats descriptifs
L'analyse descriptive du tableau 2 met en évidence les principales conclusions concernant les caractéristiques démographiques et socio-économiques des agriculteurs des catégories de groupe témoin et de traitement. Le groupe de traitement compte une proportion significativement plus élevée de participants masculins que le groupe témoin (p = 0,025), et une disparité dans la taille du ménage est évidente entre les deux groupes (p = 0,021), le groupe de traitement comptant légèrement moins de membres. De plus, le groupe témoin compte un plus grand nombre de femmes actives dans le ménage que le groupe de traitement (p = 0,003). Cependant, des variables telles que l'âge des répondants, l'expérience agricole, le niveau d'éducation, les quintiles de l'indice de richesse des ménages et la propriété foncière ne diffèrent pas significativement entre les groupes, ce qui indique une approche d'échantillonnage
équilibrée (Tableau 2).

L'évaluation des changements sur le niveau de sensibilisation après l'exposition à des informations spécifiques est essentielle pour évaluer la compréhension du contexte par les répondants. Avant l’expérience, les groupes d’agriculteurs témoins et ceux dans le groupe traitement possédaient initialement des niveaux de sensibilisation similaires

(Figure 5). Pour les agriculteurs témoins, il existe une différence significative dans les niveaux de sensibilisation avant et après l'exposition aux informations standard (valeur p = 0,004). De même, pour les agriculteurs se trouvant dans le groupe du traitement, il existe une différence significative dans les niveaux de sensibilisation avant et après l'exposition aux informations standard et supplémentaires sur les avantages (valeur p = 1,8e-05). En moyenne, les scores de sensibilisation du groupe de traitement sont plus élevés que ceux des agriculteurs du groupe de traitement avant l'intervention et des agriculteurs témoins avant et après l'intervention (Figure 5).

This methodological guidance handbook was developed in the context of the CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology (also referred to as Agroecology Initiative). The Agroecology Initiative is a collaborative partnership of eight CGIAR entities (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT, IMWI, CIMMYT, CIP, ICARDA, IFPRI, IITA, WorldFish), as well as CIFOR-ICRAF, and the French research institute CIRAD under the auspices of the Agroecology Transformative Partnership Platform (TPP). Funded by the CGIAR System Council, the initiative was implemented in eight countries from 2022 to 2024 – five in Africa (Burkina Faso, Kenya, Senegal, Tunisia, Zimbabwe), two in Asia (India, Lao PDR), and one in the Americas (Peru).
The Agroecology Initiative aimed to promote the application of contextually appropriate agroecological principles by farmers and communities in various contexts, with support from other food system actors. The Agroecology Initiative operates through so-called agroecological living landscapes (ALLs) in each country. The ALLs are geographically bound landscapes in which smallholder farmers, agroecology practitioners, researchers, and other development actors identify, test, and promote agroecological innovations across sectors and scales.
The handbook was developed under work package 1 (WP1) of the Agroecology Initiative, which focused on the co-creation of innovations in the ALLs. WP1 entailed two key components: establishing flourishing multi- stakeholder partnerships and collaboration in the designated ALLs (referred to as “ALL establishment”), and co- designing on-farm innovations. Both components were achieved through transdisciplinary co-design processes, in line with broader agroecology approaches and ontologies. The handbook aims to guide stakeholders in the ALLs in pursuing agroecological transformation processes through a participatory action research approach called the Vision-to-Action (V2A) process. The V2A process was piloted and implemented in all 11 ALLs established under the Agroecology Initiative with the support of country teams and partners.
The handbook was developed iteratively over the course of two years. Led by the listed authors, it involved many other colleagues and partners, including but not limited to Vimbayi Chimonyo (CIMMYT), Sarah Freed (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT), Marc Piraux (CIRAD), Eric Vall (CIRAD), Maria-Claudia Tristán (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT), Mark Dubois (IWMI), Gopal Kumar (IWMI), and Angela Navarrete-Cruz (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT), with tireless support from Simone Staiger Rivas (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT), as well as Marcela Quintero (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT) and Chris Dickens (IWMI). The handbook design was supported by the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT communications team, including Victoria Eugenia Rengifo and Ximena Hiles Granada, and the V2A Transformation Map was designed by Matt Sullivan from Dpict.

Useful operational definitions
• (shared) Action plan:
o A concrete, operational plan indicating which activities should or will be implemented how, where, when and by whom.
• Agroecology:
o An integrated approach that applies ecological concepts and principles to the design and management of food and agricultural systems. It aims to optimize the interactions between plants, animals, people and the environment while considering the social aspects that need to be addressed for a sustainable and equitable food system.
• Agroecology Living Landscape (ALL):
o Territories or landscapes for multi-stakeholder engagement where agroecological innovations can be identified, co-designed, tested and adopted by their stakeholders. ALLs are not primarily defined by geographical or administrative boundaries, but by the functionality of the territory. An ALL therefore refers to a geographically coherent territory or landscape at the local / sub-national level that includes different stakeholders such as producers, traders, processors, consumers, and institutions at the local, regional, or national level. These stakeholders are committed to promoting just food system transitions, including agroecology, in that territory or landscape and are willing to take transformative action towards just food systems. Their interactions and uses of the landscape give it ‘meaning’ and create unique boundaries.
• Agroecological Transition (AET):
o Refers to a holistic and integrated approach aimed at achieving multiple sustainability objectives. These objectives encompass economic, environmental, social, nutritional, health and cultural objectives. The transition to agroecology involves a technical-productive shift at the subsystem level of the farm, a social- ecological transition at the level of the rural family, its community, and its landscape, and a political- institutional transition at the level of territories, regions and countries.
• ALL members:
o Are the stakeholders engaged in the ALL through a formal process that outlines the criteria for stakeholder membership within the ALL. This process typically specifies which stakeholders can become members based on predefined criteria. Additionally, it clearly defines each member's responsibilities and commitments to the ALL.
• Behavioral driver:
o Human behavior is influenced by a complex interplay of numerous factors. These include biological determinants, psychological factors, social and cultural elements, economic and environmental factors, as well as external stressors that play a significant role in shaping how individuals interact and respond to their environment.
• Change in behavior / practices (behavior change):
o Changing behavior typically involves breaking established patterns and adopting new, more desirable behaviors to achieve a better future. In agri-food systems, behavior includes actions, interactions, and practices. This encompasses management practices at the individual, farm, or territorial/landscape level, the implementation of business models, and decision-making processes. When aggregated, individual behaviors form collective behaviors at the community, landscape, or societal level. Conversely, collective behavior influences individual behavior through social pressures and norms, dictating what society considers appropriate.
• Co-design:
o Refers to a collaborative and participatory approach to developing agricultural innovations. This process involves farmers, researchers, and other stakeholders such as technicians from farmer organizations, NGOs, or public institutions. Together, they discuss priority needs, identify existing practices, and explore and test potential innovations. The goal is to address challenges and achieve a shared vision for sustainable agricultural practices.
• External actors (to an ALL):
These are entities that operate within the ALL's territory and interact with its stakeholders to varying degrees. However, they do not necessarily share the ALL's objectives or have direct responsibilities in 6
implementing actions towards AET as defined at the ALL level. In broader development contexts, these external actors might include development agencies, research organizations, and their government or non-government local partners. Other examples are service providers, state or government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private sector entities. These actors might resist change due to differing priorities, lack of alignment with the ALL's objectives, or potential impacts on their own operations and interests.
• Foresighting and prospective analysis:
o Foresight is a collaborative and multidisciplinary process designed to explore futures in a structured and systematic way. It aims to anticipate, prepare for, and influence the course of change by analyzing potential disruptions or opportunities and considering multiple possible scenarios for the future (UN Global Pulse, 2024). Rather than predicting the future, foresight is a strategic capacity to think about the future (Shallowe et al., 2020). Foresight approaches leverage the future to rethink the present and guide or motivate action through diverse tools, both quantitative and qualitative.
• Participatory action research (PAR):
o In agroecology, Participatory Action Research (PAR) is a collaborative approach that brings together researchers and community members to tackle agricultural and ecological challenges. This method emphasizes the active involvement of all stakeholders in the research process, ensuring that the knowledge generated is both relevant and actionable. Key principles of PAR in agroecology include collaboration, where researchers and community members co-create the research agenda to address the real needs and priorities of the community. Empowerment involves local stakeholders, enabling communities to take control of their agricultural practices and make informed decisions. Sustainability focuses on developing agricultural practices that are environmentally friendly and economically viable. Reflexivity involves continuous reflection and adaptation, allowing the research process to evolve based on feedback and changing conditions.
• Placed-based:
o An approach that focuses on implementing strategies, plans, or partnerships tailored to the unique characteristics, needs, and opportunities of a specific geographic area. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding and integrating the local context, actively involving community members, and collaborating across multiple sectors to achieve sustainable and contextually appropriate outcomes.
• Theory of change:
A comprehensive description and illustration of how and why a desired change is expected to occur within a specific context. This approach emphasizes identifying and detailing the ""missing middle"" between a particular project, program, or activity—often spearheaded by external actors—and the achievement of the desired goals. It accomplishes this by explicitly hypothesizing the mechanisms that drive the anticipated changes.
• Transition pathways:
A series of steps that enable stakeholders to progress towards a desired future. Specifically, in the context of agroecology, these pathways should empower stakeholders to collaboratively design and implement agroecological food systems that align with their preferences, guided by the 13 agroecological principles.
• (shared) Vision:
A vision represents the desired future condition or state of a given system. A shared vision is a common understanding and agreement among a group of people regarding their desired future state or goals. This shared vision provides direction, motivation, and guidance for decision-making processes.

1. Introduction
This handbook has been prepared to facilitate the implementation of the CGIAR Agroecology Initiative (2022- 2024), which aims to contribute to achieving agroecological transition (AET) by developing and scaling a range of innovations in eight countries across three continents. Although developed within this specific context, the handbook provides general support and guidance to researchers and development partners working directly with communities and other agri-food system stakeholders to support locally led agroecological transformations. Designed to support principle-driven and reflexive external action, many of the approaches and tools can also meaningfully inform and structure fully landscape-driven action.
The handbook aims to guide stakeholders in pursuing Agroecological Transformation (AET) through a participatory action-research approach known as the Vision-to-Action (V2A) process. This process involves key stakeholders within Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALLs), which are multi-stakeholder territorial spaces in each country targeted by the Initiative for transformation and innovation efforts.
Action research approaches focus on co-designing practical solutions, innovations, and corresponding processes. They also aim to bring about the necessary changes in behavior and practices among the concerned actors to achieve AET. This means that core ALL stakeholders must actively contribute and participate in activities beyond those planned by the implementers of the AET intervention. Instead, ALL stakeholders should be involved in co- designing all stages of the AET program implementation, from planning to monitoring and evaluation.
Evidence and experiences from around the world increasingly highlight the importance of engaging stakeholders in developing a shared vision for the future of their agriculture, livelihoods, and territories. This shared vision should include transition pathways that structure the transformation process from the present to the desired future. These pathways can then guide the creation of practical action plans that enable all stakeholders to make this future a reality. This process, known as the Vision-to-Action (V2A) process, is the central focus of this handbook.
A key element of the V2A process is the ability to mobilize and support all stakeholders in co-designing and implementing the diverse activities necessary to foster the innovations and changes required to achieve the desired future. Our entry point for this mobilization is the question: What can motivate and equip all stakeholders to collaborate with external actors towards this goal, beyond a shared interest in agroecology?
Jointly defining a shared vision, beyond merely aggregating individual goals and interests, provides direction and fosters cohesiveness among all stakeholders. Once the goals to achieve this vision are set, the focus shifts to creating transition pathways, which become the core of the innovation and change process. A shared understanding of each stakeholder's interests and aspirations allows for exploring what each actor needs and can contribute to achieving the shared vision. This approach ensures that planned interventions address the diversity of interests and aspirations. Additionally, it helps identify and explore conflicts, interferences, gaps, and barriers, such as varying levels of resource endowments or political power.
While agroecology should not necessarily be the starting point of the V2A process, it aligns well with several agroecological principles. Notably, it blends external (scientific) and local knowledge through structured co- creation processes (principle 8) and emphasizes participation (principle 13), both of which support the broader principle of social equity. The V2A process also operationalizes the engagement principles defined under the Agroecology Initiative (Triomphe et al, 2022), particularly principles 2, 3, 4, and 6:
Inclusiveness, diversity, representativeness, and legitimacy of stakeholders
2. Genuine willingness, interest, and motivation from every stakeholder
3. A demand-driven collective agenda
4. Gradual local ownership, empowerment, and leadership over the collective agenda.
This guidance document provides a generic approach for developing a shared vision for the future of an individual ALL. It defines specific future changes or objectives that collectively form the vision, elaborates a concrete action plan to address the required changes, and monitors progress. The process involves the following steps:
8
1. Identifying a shared vision for what a desirable future for the ALL would look like in 10-15 years.
VRWNS>
Identifying strategic behavior changes that specific actors will need to pursue to achieve the shared vision.
2.
3. Developing transition pathways that allow moving from the present towards this desirable future.
4. Developing realistic action plans related to this transition pathway.
5. Designing a Participatory Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (PMEL) system to follow and adjust progress with the implementation of the action plans towards the shared vision.
Ideally, the V2A process should be conducted early on in a new multi-stakeholder engagement and collaboration cycle However, some experts argue that initiating it too early can be problematic due to factors like lack of trust, insufficient understanding among stakeholders, and the risk of developing a superficial vision. Situating the V2A process in a broader engagement process is about finding the right balance and timing to support participants to genuinely align and commit to a shared vision.
1.1 The objectives and outputs of the vision-to-action process
The V2A approach outlined in this document involves creating a shared vision for a desirable future and developing a realistic, collectively agreed-upon action plan for an ALL and its key stakeholders. This plan will help them achieve the necessary behavior changes to transition from their current situation to the envisioned future. Importantly, this document clarifies the role of AE within the shared vision and action plan.
To achieve this, six specific objectives need to be addressed during the V2A process:
1. Collectively imagine and formulate a desirable vision for the future of their territory/ALL, ensuring that the specific aspirations of each stakeholder are fairly reflected.
2. Articulate this vision precisely and realistically in alignment with the 13 agroecology principles, identifying the implications and interactions of this vision at various scales (field, farm, community, territory/landscape, region, country).
3. Identify the key behavior and practice changes that the various ALL stakeholders need to implement to achieve this vision.
4. Agree on realistic transition pathways that allow ALL stakeholders to navigate individually and collectively from the present situation towards the desirable future and the changes identified in points 1- 3.
5. Develop a realistic action plan to progress along the identified transition pathways.
6. Design an adapted monitoring, evaluation, and learning system with a set of indicators to track and adjust the agreed action plan, supporting progress in implementing the chosen pathways and reaching the desirable future.
The main outputs expected from the V2A process are as follows.
1. A well-articulated shared vision: key ALL stakeholders develop a comprehensive vision for the next 10– 15-years, detailing desirable features across multiple dimensions (social, technical, economic, environmental, political and, values-based).
2. Key behavior changes: the specific behavior changes that individual ALL stakeholders need to adopt to achieve their vision are identified.
3. Transition pathways: the steps or transition pathways that ALL members agree will need to be implemented to achieve their vision are outlined.
4. Action plan: a realistic, agreed-upon action-plan at the ALL level, which can provide entry points for various stakeholders to make meaningful contributions to the process – including external actors is developed.
5. MEL proposal: a concrete proposal for implementing the MEL of the action plan and of the functioning of the ALL itself is created.
6. Documentation and visualization: a set of individual reports documenting the various events (workshops) organized as part of the V2A process and/or illustrations (infographics) of the transition pathways to provide the ALLs and the stakeholders with clear visual representations of the complex processes and principles underlining agroecological transition pathways are produced.

1.2 The basic steps of the vision-to-action process
To achieve the objectives and outputs outlined above, we propose to organize the V2A process in five inter- related basic steps (Figure 1).

To accommodate variations in context, prior collaboration, and experience, this guidance provides multiple options for implementing the five generic steps. Implementers can emphasize specific steps and tasks based on their context and organize their workshops accordingly. The preliminary steps help implementation teams determine the most suitable operationalization for their context.

2. Steps for conducting a vision-to-
action process and developing
ALL-level action plans
As indicated, the V2A process consists of 5 main steps, along with two preliminary steps (A and B). This guidance document outlines specific procedures and methods for each step. Additionally, the Appendix section offers alternative methods for implementing teams to consider.

2.1 Preliminary step A: Getting ready for engaging the vision-to-action process
Step overview
Objective: Assess whether the conditions are adequate for engaging the V2A process, and prepare by gathering all necessary information.
Expected outputs
• Decision to start
• List of resources to mobilize
• Well-prepared team
How to proceed (Summary)
This step consists of desk work and meetings, allowing to go through a list of requirements to assess readiness levels on different counts (step A.1), and review available diagnostic studies, and if deemed critical, holding a limited number of semi-structured interviews, appreciative interviews or focus group discussions (FDG) with selected resource persons (step A.2).
It is important to ensure inclusivity by inviting relevant stakeholders and team members to participate in these meetings. This collaborative approach helps to gather diverse perspectives and fosters a more comprehensive understanding of the requirements and diagnostic studies.
Estimated time requirement: Not applicable; this step may be spread over several weeks.
A.1: Ensuring critical conditions are met at the ALL and team levels for engaging the vision-to-action process
Before starting the V2A process with key ALL stakeholders, implementing teams must assess whether relevant conditions or prerequisites are met. There are 2 sets of conditions: at the ALL level, and at the implementing team level.
ALL level critical conditions:
• There is agreement on the rough boundaries of the ALL.
• The core stakeholders for implementing the V2A process are identified.
o STH mapping has been conducted.
o Key STH and/or STH groups that should be invited have been identified (refer to the ‘Principles of Engagement’ document).
12
o The implementing team knows and understands the dynamics and power relations between different stakeholders.
o Provisional collective decision-making rules have been identified and/or are likely to be observed, allowing decision-making to take place “fairly” and power relationships to be managed with an equity / gender / empowerment perspective1 throughout the vision-to-action process.
o Some initial relationship building process has been engaged, and a minimum level of trust has been established between the key ALL stakeholders and the members of the implementing team.
o Targeted training and resources have been provided to ensure the implementing team has the necessary skills and knowledge for the V2A process.
Critical conditions for implementing teams in the V2A process
• Readiness of the team facilitating the V2A process:
o Intellectual readiness concerns include questions related to the team’s understanding of the purpose of the exercise, and of the desired results/outputs, and their ability to explain and communicate the same.
o Implementing teams should also have familiarized themselves with existing sources of information to ensure that they understand the context.
o Methodologically, implementing teams need to understand the tools, the steps/sequence, the specific methods for each tool, and the approximate time required for their administration.
In terms of its capacity to mobilize the relevant partners and stakeholders, the team needs to know precisely whom to invite, the power to convene them (directly or through partners).
o
Logistically, the team needs to be clear on the timing of various events, suitable venues, materials, food, transportation and accommodation, etc.
• Possession of the necessary knowledge and skills to implement, with the required quality, the various steps of the V2A process outlined in this document, and/or understanding from whom to get support.
o This may imply that those in charge of implementing the V2A process on the ground are or have been properly prepared / briefed / trained.
o An in-depth training and simulation session can help in strengthening the team’s capacities and will allow them to discuss and address potential challenges.
• A suitable facilitator, or even better, a team of co-facilitators, has been identified and is going to be available throughout the process, able to conduct and facilitate a meaningful and quality V2A process. Ideally, this facilitation team should include one experienced facilitator and at least two assistants for support and documentation.
o Several options are possible: choose a facilitator from the implementing team, or from one of the partners, or hire an external facilitator.
o Facilitators should have strong skills, refrain from promoting personal ideas, ask critical questions, understand agriculture holistically, encourage balanced participation, and avoid being extractive.
It is important that the facilitators and the other implementing team members","From Vision to Action (V2A) in agroecological transformation:  Understanding and implementing principle-driven participatory action research in agroecological living landscapes  The following text section comes from a specific evidence file named URL https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169532: ""From Vision to Action (V2A) in agroecological transformation: Understanding and implementing principle-driven participatory action research in agroecological living landscapes Skip to main content Communities & Collections Browse Navigate CGIAR Centers Statistics English Catal e tina Deutsch Espa ol Fran ais G idhlig Italiano Latvie u Magyar Nederlands Polski Portugu s Portugu s do Brasil Srpski (lat) Suomi Svenska T rk e Ti ng Vi t Y Log In Note: CGIAR users should log in with their Active Directory username and password.

This methodological guidance handbook was developed in the context of the CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology (also referred to as Agroecology Initiative). The Agroecology Initiative is a collaborative partnership of eight CGIAR entities (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT, IMWI, CIMMYT, CIP, ICARDA, IFPRI, IITA, WorldFish), as well as CIFOR-ICRAF, and the French research institute CIRAD under the auspices of the Agroecology Transformative Partnership Platform (TPP). Funded by the CGIAR System Council, the initiative was implemented in eight countries from 2022 to 2024 – five in Africa (Burkina Faso, Kenya, Senegal, Tunisia, Zimbabwe), two in Asia (India, Lao PDR), and one in the Americas (Peru).
The Agroecology Initiative aimed to promote the application of contextually appropriate agroecological principles by farmers and communities in various contexts, with support from other food system actors. The Agroecology Initiative operates through so-called agroecological living landscapes (ALLs) in each country. The ALLs are geographically bound landscapes in which smallholder farmers, agroecology practitioners, researchers, and other development actors identify, test, and promote agroecological innovations across sectors and scales.
The handbook was developed under work package 1 (WP1) of the Agroecology Initiative, which focused on the co-creation of innovations in the ALLs. WP1 entailed two key components: establishing flourishing multi- stakeholder partnerships and collaboration in the designated ALLs (referred to as “ALL establishment”), and co- designing on-farm innovations. Both components were achieved through transdisciplinary co-design processes, in line with broader agroecology approaches and ontologies. The handbook aims to guide stakeholders in the ALLs in pursuing agroecological transformation processes through a participatory action research approach called the Vision-to-Action (V2A) process. The V2A process was piloted and implemented in all 11 ALLs established under the Agroecology Initiative with the support of country teams and partners.
The handbook was developed iteratively over the course of two years. Led by the listed authors, it involved many other colleagues and partners, including but not limited to Vimbayi Chimonyo (CIMMYT), Sarah Freed (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT), Marc Piraux (CIRAD), Eric Vall (CIRAD), Maria-Claudia Tristán (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT), Mark Dubois (IWMI), Gopal Kumar (IWMI), and Angela Navarrete-Cruz (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT), with tireless support from Simone Staiger Rivas (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT), as well as Marcela Quintero (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT) and Chris Dickens (IWMI). The handbook design was supported by the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT communications team, including Victoria Eugenia Rengifo and Ximena Hiles Granada, and the V2A Transformation Map was designed by Matt Sullivan from Dpict.

Useful operational definitions
• (shared) Action plan:
o A concrete, operational plan indicating which activities should or will be implemented how, where, when and by whom.
• Agroecology:
o An integrated approach that applies ecological concepts and principles to the design and management of food and agricultural systems. It aims to optimize the interactions between plants, animals, people and the environment while considering the social aspects that need to be addressed for a sustainable and equitable food system.
• Agroecology Living Landscape (ALL):
o Territories or landscapes for multi-stakeholder engagement where agroecological innovations can be identified, co-designed, tested and adopted by their stakeholders. ALLs are not primarily defined by geographical or administrative boundaries, but by the functionality of the territory. An ALL therefore refers to a geographically coherent territory or landscape at the local / sub-national level that includes different stakeholders such as producers, traders, processors, consumers, and institutions at the local, regional, or national level. These stakeholders are committed to promoting just food system transitions, including agroecology, in that territory or landscape and are willing to take transformative action towards just food systems. Their interactions and uses of the landscape give it ‘meaning’ and create unique boundaries.
• Agroecological Transition (AET):
o Refers to a holistic and integrated approach aimed at achieving multiple sustainability objectives. These objectives encompass economic, environmental, social, nutritional, health and cultural objectives. The transition to agroecology involves a technical-productive shift at the subsystem level of the farm, a social- ecological transition at the level of the rural family, its community, and its landscape, and a political- institutional transition at the level of territories, regions and countries.
• ALL members:
o Are the stakeholders engaged in the ALL through a formal process that outlines the criteria for stakeholder membership within the ALL. This process typically specifies which stakeholders can become members based on predefined criteria. Additionally, it clearly defines each member's responsibilities and commitments to the ALL.
• Behavioral driver:
o Human behavior is influenced by a complex interplay of numerous factors. These include biological determinants, psychological factors, social and cultural elements, economic and environmental factors, as well as external stressors that play a significant role in shaping how individuals interact and respond to their environment.
• Change in behavior / practices (behavior change):
o Changing behavior typically involves breaking established patterns and adopting new, more desirable behaviors to achieve a better future. In agri-food systems, behavior includes actions, interactions, and practices. This encompasses management practices at the individual, farm, or territorial/landscape level, the implementation of business models, and decision-making processes. When aggregated, individual behaviors form collective behaviors at the community, landscape, or societal level. Conversely, collective behavior influences individual behavior through social pressures and norms, dictating what society considers appropriate.
• Co-design:
o Refers to a collaborative and participatory approach to developing agricultural innovations. This process involves farmers, researchers, and other stakeholders such as technicians from farmer organizations, NGOs, or public institutions. Together, they discuss priority needs, identify existing practices, and explore and test potential innovations. The goal is to address challenges and achieve a shared vision for sustainable agricultural practices.
• External actors (to an ALL):
These are entities that operate within the ALL's territory and interact with its stakeholders to varying degrees. However, they do not necessarily share the ALL's objectives or have direct responsibilities in 6
implementing actions towards AET as defined at the ALL level. In broader development contexts, these external actors might include development agencies, research organizations, and their government or non-government local partners. Other examples are service providers, state or government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private sector entities. These actors might resist change due to differing priorities, lack of alignment with the ALL's objectives, or potential impacts on their own operations and interests.
• Foresighting and prospective analysis:
o Foresight is a collaborative and multidisciplinary process designed to explore futures in a structured and systematic way. It aims to anticipate, prepare for, and influence the course of change by analyzing potential disruptions or opportunities and considering multiple possible scenarios for the future (UN Global Pulse, 2024). Rather than predicting the future, foresight is a strategic capacity to think about the future (Shallowe et al., 2020). Foresight approaches leverage the future to rethink the present and guide or motivate action through diverse tools, both quantitative and qualitative.
• Participatory action research (PAR):
o In agroecology, Participatory Action Research (PAR) is a collaborative approach that brings together researchers and community members to tackle agricultural and ecological challenges. This method emphasizes the active involvement of all stakeholders in the research process, ensuring that the knowledge generated is both relevant and actionable. Key principles of PAR in agroecology include collaboration, where researchers and community members co-create the research agenda to address the real needs and priorities of the community. Empowerment involves local stakeholders, enabling communities to take control of their agricultural practices and make informed decisions. Sustainability focuses on developing agricultural practices that are environmentally friendly and economically viable. Reflexivity involves continuous reflection and adaptation, allowing the research process to evolve based on feedback and changing conditions.
• Placed-based:
o An approach that focuses on implementing strategies, plans, or partnerships tailored to the unique characteristics, needs, and opportunities of a specific geographic area. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding and integrating the local context, actively involving community members, and collaborating across multiple sectors to achieve sustainable and contextually appropriate outcomes.
• Theory of change:
A comprehensive description and illustration of how and why a desired change is expected to occur within a specific context. This approach emphasizes identifying and detailing the ""missing middle"" between a particular project, program, or activity—often spearheaded by external actors—and the achievement of the desired goals. It accomplishes this by explicitly hypothesizing the mechanisms that drive the anticipated changes.
• Transition pathways:
A series of steps that enable stakeholders to progress towards a desired future. Specifically, in the context of agroecology, these pathways should empower stakeholders to collaboratively design and implement agroecological food systems that align with their preferences, guided by the 13 agroecological principles.
• (shared) Vision:
A vision represents the desired future condition or state of a given system. A shared vision is a common understanding and agreement among a group of people regarding their desired future state or goals. This shared vision provides direction, motivation, and guidance for decision-making processes.

1. Introduction
This handbook has been prepared to facilitate the implementation of the CGIAR Agroecology Initiative (2022- 2024), which aims to contribute to achieving agroecological transition (AET) by developing and scaling a range of innovations in eight countries across three continents. Although developed within this specific context, the handbook provides general support and guidance to researchers and development partners working directly with communities and other agri-food system stakeholders to support locally led agroecological transformations. Designed to support principle-driven and reflexive external action, many of the approaches and tools can also meaningfully inform and structure fully landscape-driven action.
The handbook aims to guide stakeholders in pursuing Agroecological Transformation (AET) through a participatory action-research approach known as the Vision-to-Action (V2A) process. This process involves key stakeholders within Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALLs), which are multi-stakeholder territorial spaces in each country targeted by the Initiative for transformation and innovation efforts.
Action research approaches focus on co-designing practical solutions, innovations, and corresponding processes. They also aim to bring about the necessary changes in behavior and practices among the concerned actors to achieve AET. This means that core ALL stakeholders must actively contribute and participate in activities beyond those planned by the implementers of the AET intervention. Instead, ALL stakeholders should be involved in co- designing all stages of the AET program implementation, from planning to monitoring and evaluation.
Evidence and experiences from around the world increasingly highlight the importance of engaging stakeholders in developing a shared vision for the future of their agriculture, livelihoods, and territories. This shared vision should include transition pathways that structure the transformation process from the present to the desired future. These pathways can then guide the creation of practical action plans that enable all stakeholders to make this future a reality. This process, known as the Vision-to-Action (V2A) process, is the central focus of this handbook.
A key element of the V2A process is the ability to mobilize and support all stakeholders in co-designing and implementing the diverse activities necessary to foster the innovations and changes required to achieve the desired future. Our entry point for this mobilization is the question: What can motivate and equip all stakeholders to collaborate with external actors towards this goal, beyond a shared interest in agroecology?
Jointly defining a shared vision, beyond merely aggregating individual goals and interests, provides direction and fosters cohesiveness among all stakeholders. Once the goals to achieve this vision are set, the focus shifts to creating transition pathways, which become the core of the innovation and change process. A shared understanding of each stakeholder's interests and aspirations allows for exploring what each actor needs and can contribute to achieving the shared vision. This approach ensures that planned interventions address the diversity of interests and aspirations. Additionally, it helps identify and explore conflicts, interferences, gaps, and barriers, such as varying levels of resource endowments or political power.
While agroecology should not necessarily be the starting point of the V2A process, it aligns well with several agroecological principles. Notably, it blends external (scientific) and local knowledge through structured co- creation processes (principle 8) and emphasizes participation (principle 13), both of which support the broader principle of social equity. The V2A process also operationalizes the engagement principles defined under the Agroecology Initiative (Triomphe et al, 2022), particularly principles 2, 3, 4, and 6:
Inclusiveness, diversity, representativeness, and legitimacy of stakeholders
2. Genuine willingness, interest, and motivation from every stakeholder
3. A demand-driven collective agenda
4. Gradual local ownership, empowerment, and leadership over the collective agenda.
This guidance document provides a generic approach for developing a shared vision for the future of an individual ALL. It defines specific future changes or objectives that collectively form the vision, elaborates a concrete action plan to address the required changes, and monitors progress. The process involves the following steps:
8
1. Identifying a shared vision for what a desirable future for the ALL would look like in 10-15 years.
VRWNS>
Identifying strategic behavior changes that specific actors will need to pursue to achieve the shared vision.
2.
3. Developing transition pathways that allow moving from the present towards this desirable future.
4. Developing realistic action plans related to this transition pathway.
5. Designing a Participatory Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (PMEL) system to follow and adjust progress with the implementation of the action plans towards the shared vision.
Ideally, the V2A process should be conducted early on in a new multi-stakeholder engagement and collaboration cycle However, some experts argue that initiating it too early can be problematic due to factors like lack of trust, insufficient understanding among stakeholders, and the risk of developing a superficial vision. Situating the V2A process in a broader engagement process is about finding the right balance and timing to support participants to genuinely align and commit to a shared vision.
1.1 The objectives and outputs of the vision-to-action process
The V2A approach outlined in this document involves creating a shared vision for a desirable future and developing a realistic, collectively agreed-upon action plan for an ALL and its key stakeholders. This plan will help them achieve the necessary behavior changes to transition from their current situation to the envisioned future. Importantly, this document clarifies the role of AE within the shared vision and action plan.
To achieve this, six specific objectives need to be addressed during the V2A process:
1. Collectively imagine and formulate a desirable vision for the future of their territory/ALL, ensuring that the specific aspirations of each stakeholder are fairly reflected.
2. Articulate this vision precisely and realistically in alignment with the 13 agroecology principles, identifying the implications and interactions of this vision at various scales (field, farm, community, territory/landscape, region, country).
3. Identify the key behavior and practice changes that the various ALL stakeholders need to implement to achieve this vision.
4. Agree on realistic transition pathways that allow ALL stakeholders to navigate individually and collectively from the present situation towards the desirable future and the changes identified in points 1- 3.
5. Develop a realistic action plan to progress along the identified transition pathways.
6. Design an adapted monitoring, evaluation, and learning system with a set of indicators to track and adjust the agreed action plan, supporting progress in implementing the chosen pathways and reaching the desirable future.
The main outputs expected from the V2A process are as follows.
1. A well-articulated shared vision: key ALL stakeholders develop a comprehensive vision for the next 10– 15-years, detailing desirable features across multiple dimensions (social, technical, economic, environmental, political and, values-based).
2. Key behavior changes: the specific behavior changes that individual ALL stakeholders need to adopt to achieve their vision are identified.
3. Transition pathways: the steps or transition pathways that ALL members agree will need to be implemented to achieve their vision are outlined.
4. Action plan: a realistic, agreed-upon action-plan at the ALL level, which can provide entry points for various stakeholders to make meaningful contributions to the process – including external actors is developed.
5. MEL proposal: a concrete proposal for implementing the MEL of the action plan and of the functioning of the ALL itself is created.
6. Documentation and visualization: a set of individual reports documenting the various events (workshops) organized as part of the V2A process and/or illustrations (infographics) of the transition pathways to provide the ALLs and the stakeholders with clear visual representations of the complex processes and principles underlining agroecological transition pathways are produced.

1.2 The basic steps of the vision-to-action process
To achieve the objectives and outputs outlined above, we propose to organize the V2A process in five inter- related basic steps (Figure 1).

2.1 Preliminary step A: Getting ready for engaging the vision-to-action process
Step overview
Objective: Assess whether the conditions are adequate for engaging the V2A process, and prepare by gathering all necessary information.
Expected outputs
• Decision to start
• List of resources to mobilize
• Well-prepared team
How to proceed (Summary)
This step consists of desk work and meetings, allowing to go through a list of requirements to assess readiness levels on different counts (step A.1), and review available diagnostic studies, and if deemed critical, holding a limited number of semi-structured interviews, appreciative interviews or focus group discussions (FDG) with selected resource persons (step A.2).
It is important to ensure inclusivity by inviting relevant stakeholders and team members to participate in these meetings. This collaborative approach helps to gather diverse perspectives and fosters a more comprehensive understanding of the requirements and diagnostic studies.
Estimated time requirement: Not applicable; this step may be spread over several weeks.
A.1: Ensuring critical conditions are met at the ALL and team levels for engaging the vision-to-action process
Before starting the V2A process with key ALL stakeholders, implementing teams must assess whether relevant conditions or prerequisites are met. There are 2 sets of conditions: at the ALL level, and at the implementing team level.
ALL level critical conditions:
• There is agreement on the rough boundaries of the ALL.
• The core stakeholders for implementing the V2A process are identified.
o STH mapping has been conducted.
o Key STH and/or STH groups that should be invited have been identified (refer to the ‘Principles of Engagement’ document).
12
o The implementing team knows and understands the dynamics and power relations between different stakeholders.
o Provisional collective decision-making rules have been identified and/or are likely to be observed, allowing decision-making to take place “fairly” and power relationships to be managed with an equity / gender / empowerment perspective1 throughout the vision-to-action process.
o Some initial relationship building process has been engaged, and a minimum level of trust has been established between the key ALL stakeholders and the members of the implementing team.
o Targeted training and resources have been provided to ensure the implementing team has the necessary skills and knowledge for the V2A process.
Critical conditions for implementing teams in the V2A process
• Readiness of the team facilitating the V2A process:
o Intellectual readiness concerns include questions related to the team’s understanding of the purpose of the exercise, and of the desired results/outputs, and their ability to explain and communicate the same.
o Implementing teams should also have familiarized themselves with existing sources of information to ensure that they understand the context.
o Methodologically, implementing teams need to understand the tools, the steps/sequence, the specific methods for each tool, and the approximate time required for their administration.
In terms of its capacity to mobilize the relevant partners and stakeholders, the team needs to know precisely whom to invite, the power to convene them (directly or through partners).
o
Logistically, the team needs to be clear on the timing of various events, suitable venues, materials, food, transportation and accommodation, etc.
• Possession of the necessary knowledge and skills to implement, with the required quality, the various steps of the V2A process outlined in this document, and/or understanding from whom to get support.
o This may imply that those in charge of implementing the V2A process on the ground are or have been properly prepared / briefed / trained.
o An in-depth training and simulation session can help in strengthening the team’s capacities and will allow them to discuss and address potential challenges.
• A suitable facilitator, or even better, a team of co-facilitators, has been identified and is going to be available throughout the process, able to conduct and facilitate a meaningful and quality V2A process. Ideally, this facilitation team should include one experienced facilitator and at least two assistants for support and documentation.
o Several options are possible: choose a facilitator from the implementing team, or from one of the partners, or hire an external facilitator.
o Facilitators should have strong skills, refrain from promoting personal ideas, ask critical questions, understand agriculture holistically, encourage balanced participation, and avoid being extractive.
It is important that the facilitators and the other implementing team members"

2.8. Early Warning
Forecast Indicators and Early Warning
The weather forecast is the prediction of what the atmosphere will be like in a particular place by using technology and scientific knowledge to make weather observations. In other words, it's a way of predicting things like cloud cover, rain, snow, wind speed, and temperature before they happen.
Forecast data is categorised into three groups based on the duration they cover: short, medium, and long-range forecasts. Each set is used to predict weather parameters over different periods, providing crucial information for effective climate risk management and planning. Short-range forecasts, typically provided by sources like OpenWeather and NOAA GFS offer detailed weather predictions for up to seven days to 15 days, including parameters such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and humidity.
Medium-range forecasts, such as those from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), extend from 10 to 30 days, providing insights into weather patterns and potential severe weather events. Long- range forecasts, sourced from institutions like the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), offer climate predictions for periods from one month to four months ahead. These forecasts are essential for strategic planning and risk management, enabling stakeholders to anticipate and prepare for seasonal trends and climate variability. Each type of forecast data, with its specific time frame and resolution, provides critical information to enhance preparedness and mitigate the impacts of climate-related hazards by taking proactive measure.
The Early Warning System (EWS) in the AWARE Platform provides users with the tools to monitor and predict climate- related hazards across different administrative boundaries and time scales. This section will guide you through selecting geographic areas and forecast data ranges to use the EWS in AWARE platform effectively.

Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI)
SMCI, denoting Soil Moisture Condition Index, is a metric expressing the soil moisture condition, calculated through the following equation (Bhuiyan et al, 2006):
SMCI= (SMi-SMmin/SMmax-SMmin)100
SMi = Current Soil Moisture, SMmin = Minumum Soil Moisture, SMmax = Maximum Soil Moisture
The SMCI value ranges from 0 to 100, with a value nearing 0 indicating extreme soil moisture stress and values close to 100 representing a healthy soil moisture situation. Here, SMmin and SMmax denote the long-term minimum and

maximum soil moisture for a specific pixel, while SMi represents the current soil moisture for the same pixel. Follow the same procedure used in Dry spell to visualize the SMCI data as below.
Een) Cr Monitoring Indicators @asmin OC aasin 1011372008 meres Temporal Aggregation
Integrated Drought Severity Index (IDSI)
IDSI, or Integrated Drought Severity Index (Amarnath et al, 2021), is derived from the fusion of multi-scale Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) and Evapo- Transpiration Condition Index (ETCI) through advanced data fusion techniques. The IDSI values span from 0 to 100, mirroring the scale of previous indices. Near-zero values indicate extreme drought conditions, while values nearing 100 signify robust vegetation health and an absence of drought. The calculation of the Integrated Drought Severity Index (IDSI) is performed using the following equation.
IDSIijk=0.6*VCIijk+0.1*SMCIijk+0.2*PCIijk+0.1*ETCIijk
IDSIijk, VCIijk, TCIijk and PCIijk are IDSI, VCI, SMCI, ETCI and PCI values for a pixel (i) in a composite (j) of a year (k).

Forecast Indicators and Early Warning
The weather forecast is the prediction of what the atmosphere will be like in a particular place by using technology and scientific knowledge to make weather observations. In other words, it's a way of predicting things like cloud cover, rain, snow, wind speed, and temperature before they happen.
Forecast data is categorised into three groups based on the duration they cover: short, medium, and long-range forecasts. Each set is used to predict weather parameters over different periods, providing crucial information for effective climate risk management and planning. Short-range forecasts, typically provided by sources like OpenWeather and NOAA GFS offer detailed weather predictions for up to seven days to 15 days, including parameters such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and humidity.
Medium-range forecasts, such as those from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), extend from 10 to 30 days, providing insights into weather patterns and potential severe weather events. Long- range forecasts, sourced from institutions like the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), offer climate predictions for periods from one month to four months ahead. These forecasts are essential for strategic planning and risk management, enabling stakeholders to anticipate and prepare for seasonal trends and climate variability. Each type of forecast data, with its specific time frame and resolution, provides critical information to enhance preparedness and mitigate the impacts of climate-related hazards by taking proactive measure.

The system consolidates key drought indicators, including Dry Spell, Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), and Integrated Drought Severity Index (IDSI). Additionally, flood indicators comprise accumulated rainfall, flood extent derived from both Sentinel-1 and MODIS, GLOWFAS, and GeoGlows.

3.1. Drought indicators
Dry spell
A dry spell is identified by a series of consecutive days within a one-month timeframe during which daily precipitation falls below a predefined threshold, such as 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 mm (Suppiah and Hennessy, 1998). This application employs CHIRPS data to calculate the number of dry days, enabling the assessment of dry spell durations over the course of a one-month period.
Steps to be follows:
• Select country
• Click on parameter (Dry spell)
• Define threshold (2.5mm)
• Define date range (start – end for a one month)
• Click apply layer
This common approach applicable for the all the drought indicators.

Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI)
SMCI, denoting Soil Moisture Condition Index, is a metric expressing the soil moisture condition, calculated through the following equation (Bhuiyan et al, 2006):
SMCI= (SMi-SMmin/SMmax-SMmin)100
SMi = Current Soil Moisture, SMmin = Minumum Soil Moisture, SMmax = Maximum Soil Moisture
The SMCI value ranges from 0 to 100, with a value nearing 0 indicating extreme soil moisture stress and values close to 100 representing a healthy soil moisture situation. Here, SMmin and SMmax denote the long-term minimum and

Integrated Drought Severity Index (IDSI)
IDSI, or Integrated Drought Severity Index (Amarnath et al, 2021), is derived from the fusion of multi-scale Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) and Evapo- Transpiration Condition Index (ETCI) through advanced data fusion techniques. The IDSI values span from 0 to 100, mirroring the scale of previous indices. Near-zero values indicate extreme drought conditions, while values nearing 100 signify robust vegetation health and an absence of drought. The calculation of the Integrated Drought Severity Index (IDSI) is performed using the following equation.
IDSIijk=0.6*VCIijk+0.1*SMCIijk+0.2*PCIijk+0.1*ETCIijk
IDSIijk, VCIijk, TCIijk and PCIijk are IDSI, VCI, SMCI, ETCI and PCI values for a pixel (i) in a composite (j) of a year (k).

3.2. Flood indicators
To visualize flood indicators, users can follow a similar approach as employed for drought indicators. This involves utilizing the provided parameters for Accumulated Rainfall (GPM – Global Precipitation Measurement), Flood (ESA – European Space Agency), and Flood (NASA – National Aeronautics and Space Administration). Notably, these parameters support a comparative analysis, enabling users to assess and compare different indicators across various timeframes.
Steps to be follows
• Select country
• Click on parameter (Dry spell)
• Define threshold (2.5mm)
• Define date range (start – end for a one month)
• Click apply layer
This common approach applicable for Accumulated Rainfall (GPM), Flood (ESA), and Flood (NASA)
Accumulated rainfall
The Accumulated Rainfall (GPM – https://gpm.nasa.gov/data ) metric offers an assessment of the total precipitation received within a specified area over a defined period. GPM, denoting Global Precipitation Measurement, employs a satellite-based system to measure precipitation. The calculation of Accumulated Rainfall (GPM) involves summing the precipitation measurements recorded at half-hour intervals over a designated area during a specific timeframe. The result provides a measure of cumulative rainfall, expressed in millimetres.

Flood (ESA & NASA)
The Flood (ESA – https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S1_GRD) indicator is a method for measuring flood extent, utilizing data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1. The Sentinel-1 satellite employs radar sensors to capture detailed images of the Earth's surface, enabling the identification and mapping of flood extent. This approach is advantageous as it allows for flood monitoring at any time, irrespective of weather conditions, providing a reliable tool for assessing the spatial scope of floods.
The Flood (NASA – https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MOD09A1) indicator measures flood extent by leveraging the capabilities of the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MO"

Background and introduction
The Sri Lanka Anticipatory Action for Disaster Mitigation activities, conducted in collaboration with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and World Vision Lanka (WVL), seeks to set a model for effective disaster mitigation strategies.
Anticipatory Action (AA) Intervention requires a proactive strategy within disaster risk management, involving implementation of measures before the occurrence of a potential disaster, guided by early warnings, forecasts, and pre-disaster risk analysis. This is achieved through the timely implementation of anticipatory actions and the improvement of coordination among all stakeholders involved in disaster risk reduction efforts.
Chrystler Farm, Kotagala Estate, located in Nuwara Eliya District is prone to frequent flooding of a canal running through the tea estate. This is a pilot site selected for developing AA for flood hazards.
In July 2023, an anticipatory action drill followed by alerts from early warning systems has been conducted engaging the community in the Chrystler Farm1. This was considered as a first step in flood mitigation, building and strengthening awareness and resilience of local communities, as well as local ownership.
As part of the early action, structural flood mitigation solutions appropriate for this location have been carried out. Based on a technical assessment, and in consultation and participation of the community living along the canal, a part of the canal has been cleaned and debris have been removed as a flood mitigation measure, specifically to improve the flow of rainwater coming from the upstream.
Inclusiveness is a key feature in developing and programming AA. Ensuring the inclusion of the most vulnerable groups such as elderly, children, women who are specifically vulnerable, people with special needs (PwSNs), illiterate, and ethnic minorities are aimed at every action. These parameters are paid attention in beneficiaries’ selections, in ensuring dignity, providing access to services, and equal opportunities for active participation.
Objectives of the visit
Field activities were conducted with the community and key stakeholders to gather the most relevant information to meet the objectives mentioned below.
o To collect context-specific information and make observations regarding gender and social inclusion aspects.
o To further explore elements crucial for planning and operationalizing anticipatory action.
Discussion with community members in Chrystler Farm
- Out of 50 families settled along the canal, about 25 homes get flooded regularly.
- Community members expressed their views that the canal needs to be dug deeper, to reduce the flash flood risks, and that the recent canal widening (handled by the World Vision team as part of the AA pilot project), will not be inadequate in this respect

The Representative of World Vision and IWMI clarified that the canal cleaning and widening are carried out following the technical specifications provided by the Government Technical Officer for the area, based on the original canal design, and no independent decisions can be made on this matter.


The issue of maintaining the canal cleaning as part of the project was discussed in detail since:
i.
There is no mechanism for regular maintenance and cleaning of the canal. It was mentioned in past years the canal has been cleaned several times by different parties using machinery over the past decades, however due to absence of regular maintenance it has got filled up with debris, leading to flooding.
i.
ii. The families who live along the canal use it as a dumping ground for disposing of household garbage, which needs to be prevented.
iii. From the community perspective, there is no place to dump garbage or no routine garbage collection system by the local authority.
- At the end of the discussion, the following plan was agreed for preventing the use of the canal to dump garbage:
o Awareness raising on garbage disposal and compost making for home gardening – WV team will carry out a systematic program with the community and monitor implementation 2
o Community representatives will discuss whether arranging regular garbage collection is possible
o Estate Management will supply polypropylene bags to collect plastic waste and explore to connect with plastic re- cycling organizations in the area
o Estate Management was requested to see the possibility of providing some space for garbage disposal (as of now there is no space allocated for this purpose)
o Display sign boards along the canal stating ‘dumping garbage into the canal is a punishable offense’
o A team of community members has agreed to police and report any garbage dumping into the canal (to the estate management/to PHI), dividing sections of the canal to monitor them. Some members of the community volunteered for this task.
2 World Vision has previous experience working in other locations providing communities with compost barrels and developing awareness to make compost out of household organic garbage for home gardening.

- Community members shared their experience on applying the learning from the anticipatory action drill, that the experience resulted in better awareness on preparing for floods, which helped to face the flooding which occurred in November 2023 in a more organized manner, including the pre- preparation of evacuation bags, moving the animals to safety
- The community faces the challenge of not having safe shelter in the flooding situation. The typical buildings used for evacuation during the drill – the nursery, the Kovil (Hindu temple), and the church- were cut off by the flood waters. During the November 2024 floods, families had to move individually to their relatives’ homes where possible.
- It was suggested to the community to propose a suitable option for this purpose, but they could not make it.
- The need for a regular canal cleaning plan was discussed and proposed to form a sub-committee of volunteers.
- It was agreed to call a general meeting inviting all families living in the estate, Grama Niladhari, PHI, the Police, District DMC officials, and Estate Management to discuss sustainable canal maintenance and garbage management issues, build awareness, and agree on action plans.

Disaster Management Centre (DMC)
- There are five committees set up with each Grama Niladhari Division related to disaster management. Community in Chrystler Farm are committee members, however, the committees are not active on a regular basis.
- It was proposed to set up a subcommittee to clean and maintain the canal on a regular basis to ensure minimizing flood risk. DMC agreed to support canal maintenance by forming a dedicated sub-committee through the existing DMC subcommittees.
- The issue of the need for a community based early warning system was discussed with the DMC, since flooding happening at the local canal is not connected with the national/district level’s early warning systems.
- The simulation exercise adapted the national early warning system, which appeared not appropriate for this location. Rainfall information for local area is not monitored through nationally connected rain gauges.
- DMC agreed to collaborate to develop a local early warning mechanism. At the next meeting of the ‘Monsoon Forum’ this issue will be tabled for discussion.
- DMC will also engage school children by distributing rain gauges to monitor local area rainfall.
- DMC will re-activate the DMC Committees and actions at the Grama Niladhari level
- According to the discussion with the district level DMC Officer (Mr. Bandara), there is adequate awareness on social inclusion issues with the district level teams. Women are generally included in the various committees established in the planning and implementation process.
- It was observed, however, that the social inclusion aspects from anticipatory action perspectives need to be shared and their awareness needs to be built, in a more specific manner in moving forward

Discussion with the Estate manager, Mr. Kusal
- Strongly proposed to move away from voluntarily keeping the canal cleaning/maintenance mechanism and suggested creating a fund where community members contribute.
- The estate management committed to contribute based on 60/40 ratio between the community and the estate contribution. IWMI indicated checking the possible seed funding for this fund.
- The main purpose of the fund will be to employ laborers on a regular basis as well as based on the need to maintain the canal from accumulating debris, enabling the free flow of upstream rainwater to minimize flood risk.
- The fund can be operated through the estate welfare mechanism, to be used to pay labour requirements. It was also suggested to take consent in writing from the estate working families on the regular contribution (eg. Rs 100/- a month), as well as consent from the non-working families on the modality of contributions in cash. The subcommittee will be responsible for collecting money from non-working families and issuing a receipt for the collection.
- In addition to matching with 40% of the cash contribution the estate management will provide machinery such as tractors for regular cleaning. Based on the previous experience on voluntary committees for similar activities, the manager noted this as a ‘win- win’ approach, where both parties commit to meet the objectives to keep the canal clean.
It was suggested to ensure the inclusion of women in the committee that will be set up for this purpose.
Discussion with the District Secretary (DS), Nuwara Eliya
The DS was briefed about the project, specifically its focus on long term mitigation action as a climate resilience measure. The DS committed to extend the support of his office. Specifically:
- Connect the Chrystlers farm with the regular garbage collection system
- Connect with the plastic re-cycling operations in the area
- Communicate to the Grama Niladhari of the area to take an active part in the project activities
Networks/committees
There are a number of committees where the community is engaged; Youth, Temple, World Vision Committee for families and children, and committees set up by the DMC. Most of these are not active on any regular basis.
It was proposed to set up two specific sub committees, to work actively in project implementation, execution of anticipatory action and monitoring:
i. Early Warning Subcommittee- to coordinate and communicate flood early warning (consisting of the members of the DMC committee)
Canal cleaning committee: members from the community who commit to attend to canal cleaning

Discussion with the Welfare Officer (Chrystler Farm)
Statistics on the community in the project area are presented in the Table 1. There are in total 452 families, with a sex distribution of 733 males (47.44) and 812 females (52.2%). About 7% are persons are over 65 yrs, and 3% of the community are people with special needs. 4.2% of the households are female headed. The labour force consists of 12.5 % the youth in the community account for 15.4%.
There is no sex-based discrimination in the labour payments, both males and females receive a minimum payment of Rs 1000/- per workday3. Additional payments are per kg of extra leaves plucked.
According to the Welfare Officer, no reportable abuse of alcohol/drugs in the community – mainly due to the high costs involved in obtaining these substances (this may need further verification).
Table 1: Population statistics of the community in the pilot project area
Number of working families 223 Number of non- working families 229 Male Female Family members (in working families) 531 605 Family members (in non- working families) 202 267 Number of labourers 79 113 People over 65 yrs of age 44 63 Youth (Approximately 16-25 yrs of age) 112 126 Children under 05 years 51 54 School attending children 169 217 People with dis-abilities 11 12 People who are dependent due to sicknesses etc. 10 11 Families headed by women 19 Pregnant women (If information available) 08 Families with livestock (cows/goats) 36 People engaged in other income generating activities 32
As the population statistics indicate, the community in the project area consist of persons with varying socio- economic characteristics, with reference to employment status, age and sex. The elderly and the persons with

specific needs are approximately 10% of the community, and 6.7 % are children under 5 years. Planning and execution of Anticipatory Action need to take into consideration the needs and priorities from the perspectives of those who have specific considerations, specifically:
i. Males (44) and females (63) who are over 65 yrs (7% in total)
ii. Children under 05 yrs (male 51, female 54) (6.7% in total)
iii. Males and females with special needs -those who are dependents and those with disabilities
iv. Families headed by women (4.2%)
v. Pregnant women
Each of the above groups will have specific requirements that needs to be met in them accessing and responding to early warning messages, in flood preparedness, and in flood response. Therefore, it is of critical importance that these specific requirements are identified and incorporated into AA plans and execution mechanisms. The rest of the community members extend their help to those with special needs in the times of need as a practice, however, it is important to identify these groups and their needs, and to mark appropriate measures in planning anticipatory action, engaging these groups, and others in the community in executing the actions.
Further, it is important that all groups listed in the Table 1 are consulted, specifically male and female youth, to identify the anticipatory action that are locally relevant, that enable their participation and consistent engagement.
- Inform the Grama Niladhari through official channels to get her engagement in the project activities – this request was made to the District Secretary, Nuwara Eliya, may need further follow up by IWMI at the Divisional Secretary level.
- Canal cleaning/ maintenance plan: call for a general meeting within two weeks to discuss and agree on a canal maintenance plan, including:
o Cash contributions (tentatively agreed to contribute Rs 100/- per family, per month)
o Nominate person/s to collect contributions from non-working families
o Working families to give written consent to estate management to deduct from the payroll
o Canal cleaning labour and other related expenses to be paid from the fund
o Fund to be maintained through the Welfare society
Follow up with the District DMC officials on the local early warning mechanism and form a DMC sub- committee supporting the canal cleaning.

Local early warning mechanism need to consider the groups with special needs and engage the male and female members of the youth in the community

- Women take active participation in the discussions, express their views, and come forward to take on responsibilities. Project follow up actions ensure to engage women in consultations, committees, in planning and obtaining feedback/monitoring processes.
- Further work on the canal – obtain technical specifications from the TO (who agreed to provide specifications and cost estimate in a week's time)
- Maintain communication/information exchange with the community to keep the momentum of the project activities.

Background and introduction
The Sri Lanka Anticipatory Action for Disaster Mitigation activities, conducted in collaboration with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and World Vision Lanka (WVL), seeks to set a model for effective disaster mitigation strategies.
Anticipatory Action (AA) Intervention requires a proactive strategy within disaster risk management, involving implementation of measures before the occurrence of a potential disaster, guided by early warnings, forecasts, and pre-disaster risk analysis. This is achieved through the timely implementation of anticipatory actions and the improvement of coordination among all stakeholders involved in disaster risk reduction efforts.
Chrystler Farm, Kotagala Estate, located in Nuwara Eliya District is prone to frequent flooding of a canal running through the tea estate. This is a pilot site selected for developing AA for flood hazards.
In July 2023, an anticipatory action drill followed by alerts from early warning systems has been conducted engaging the community in the Chrystler Farm1. This was considered as a first step in flood mitigation, building and strengthening awareness and resilience of local communities, as well as local ownership.
As part of the early action, structural flood mitigation solutions appropriate for this location have been carried out. Based on a technical assessment, and in consultation and participation of the community living along the canal, a part of the canal has been cleaned and debris have been removed as a flood mitigation measure, specifically to improve the flow of rainwater coming from the upstream.
Inclusiveness is a key feature in developing and programming AA. Ensuring the inclusion of the most vulnerable groups such as elderly, children, women who are specifically vulnerable, people with special needs (PwSNs), illiterate, and ethnic minorities are aimed at every action. These parameters are paid attention in beneficiaries’ selections, in ensuring dignity, providing access to services, and equal opportunities for active participation.
Objectives of the visit
Field activities were conducted with the community and key stakeholders to gather the most relevant information to meet the objectives mentioned below.
o To collect context-specific information and make observations regarding gender and social inclusion aspects.
o To further explore elements crucial for planning and operationalizing anticipatory action.
Discussion with community members in Chrystler Farm
- Out of 50 families settled along the canal, about 25 homes get flooded regularly.
- Community members expressed their views that the canal needs to be dug deeper, to reduce the flash flood risks, and that the recent canal widening (handled by the World Vision team as part of the AA pilot project), will not be inadequate in this respect

The Representative of World Vision and IWMI clarified that the canal cleaning and widening are carried out following the technical specifications provided by the Government Technical Officer for the area, based on the original canal design, and no independent decisions can be made on this matter.


The issue of maintaining the canal cleaning as part of the project was discussed in detail since:
i.
There is no mechanism for regular maintenance and cleaning of the canal. It was mentioned in past years the canal has been cleaned several times by different parties using machinery over the past decades, however due to absence of regular maintenance it has got filled up with debris, leading to flooding.
i.
ii. The families who live along the canal use it as a dumping ground for disposing of household garbage, which needs to be prevented.
iii. From the community perspective, there is no place to dump garbage or no routine garbage collection system by the local authority.
- At the end of the discussion, the following plan was agreed for preventing the use of the canal to dump garbage:
o Awareness raising on garbage disposal and compost making for home gardening – WV team will carry out a systematic program with the community and monitor implementation 2
o Community representatives will discuss whether arranging regular garbage collection is possible
o Estate Management will supply polypropylene bags to collect plastic waste and explore to connect with plastic re- cycling organizations in the area
o Estate Management was requested to see the possibility of providing some space for garbage disposal (as of now there is no space allocated for this purpose)
o Display sign boards along the canal stating ‘dumping garbage into the canal is a punishable offense’
o A team of community members has agreed to police and report any garbage dumping into the canal (to the estate management/to PHI), dividing sections of the canal to monitor them. Some members of the community volunteered for this task.
2 World Vision has previous experience working in other locations providing communities with compost barrels and developing awareness to make compost out of household organic garbage for home gardening.

- Community members shared their experience on applying the learning from the anticipatory action drill, that the experience resulted in better awareness on preparing for floods, which helped to face the flooding which occurred in November 2023 in a more organized manner, including the pre- preparation of evacuation bags, moving the animals to safety
- The community faces the challenge of not having safe shelter in the flooding situation. The typical buildings used for evacuation during the drill – the nursery, the Kovil (Hindu temple), and the church- were cut off by the flood waters. During the November 2024 floods, families had to move individually to their relatives’ homes where possible.
- It was suggested to the community to propose a suitable option for this purpose, but they could not make it.
- The need for a regular canal cleaning plan was discussed and proposed to form a sub-committee of volunteers.
- It was agreed to call a general meeting inviting all families living in the estate, Grama Niladhari, PHI, the Police, District DMC officials, and Estate Management to discuss sustainable canal maintenance and garbage management issues, build awareness, and agree on action plans.

Disaster Management Centre (DMC)
- There are five committees set up with each Grama Niladhari Division related to disaster management. Community in Chrystler Farm are committee members, however, the committees are not active on a regular basis.
- It was proposed to set up a subcommittee to clean and maintain the canal on a regular basis to ensure minimizing flood risk. DMC agreed to support canal maintenance by forming a dedicated sub-committee through the existing DMC subcommittees.
- The issue of the need for a community based early warning system was discussed with the DMC, since flooding happening at the local canal is not connected with the national/district level’s early warning systems.
- The simulation exercise adapted the national early warning system, which appeared not appropriate for this location. Rainfall information for local area is not monitored through nationally connected rain gauges.
- DMC agreed to collaborate to develop a local early warning mechanism. At the next meeting of the ‘Monsoon Forum’ this issue will be tabled for discussion.
- DMC will also engage school children by distributing rain gauges to monitor local area rainfall.
- DMC will re-activate the DMC Committees and actions at the Grama Niladhari level
- According to the discussion with the district level DMC Officer (Mr. Bandara), there is adequate awareness on social inclusion issues with the district level teams. Women are generally included in the various committees established in the planning and implementation process.
- It was observed, however, that the social inclusion aspects from anticipatory action perspectives need to be shared and their awareness needs to be built, in a more specific manner in moving forward

Discussion with the Estate manager, Mr. Kusal
- Strongly proposed to move away from voluntarily keeping the canal cleaning/maintenance mechanism and suggested creating a fund where community members contribute.
- The estate management committed to contribute based on 60/40 ratio between the community and the estate contribution. IWMI indicated checking the possible seed funding for this fund.
- The main purpose of the fund will be to employ laborers on a regular basis as well as based on the need to maintain the canal from accumulating debris, enabling the free flow of upstream rainwater to minimize flood risk.
- The fund can be operated through the estate welfare mechanism, to be used to pay labour requirements. It was also suggested to take consent in writing from the estate working families on the regular contribution (eg. Rs 100/- a month), as well as consent from the non-working families on the modality of contributions in cash. The subcommittee will be responsible for collecting money from non-working families and issuing a receipt for the collection.
- In addition to matching with 40% of the cash contribution the estate management will provide machinery such as tractors for regular cleaning. Based on the previous experience on voluntary committees for similar activities, the manager noted this as a ‘win- win’ approach, where both parties commit to meet the objectives to keep the canal clean.
It was suggested to ensure the inclusion of women in the committee that will be set up for this purpose.
Discussion with the District Secretary (DS), Nuwara Eliya
The DS was briefed about the project, specifically its focus on long term mitigation action as a climate resilience measure. The DS committed to extend the support of his office. Specifically:
- Connect the Chrystlers farm with the regular garbage collection system
- Connect with the plastic re-cycling operations in the area
- Communicate to the Grama Niladhari of the area to take an active part in the project activities
Networks/committees
There are a number of committees where the community is engaged; Youth, Temple, World Vision Committee for families and children, and committees set up by the DMC. Most of these are not active on any regular basis.
It was proposed to set up two specific sub committees, to work actively in project implementation, execution of anticipatory action and monitoring:
i. Early Warning Subcommittee- to coordinate and communicate flood early warning (consisting of the members of the DMC committee)
Canal cleaning committee: members from the community who commit to attend to canal cleaning

Discussion with the Welfare Officer (Chrystler Farm)
Statistics on the community in the project area are presented in the Table 1. There are in total 452 families, with a sex distribution of 733 males (47.44) and 812 females (52.2%). About 7% are persons are over 65 yrs, and 3% of the community are people with special needs. 4.2% of the households are female headed. The labour force consists of 12.5 % the youth in the community account for 15.4%.
There is no sex-based discrimination in the labour payments, both males and females receive a minimum payment of Rs 1000/- per workday3. Additional payments are per kg of extra leaves plucked.
According to the Welfare Officer, no reportable abuse of alcohol/drugs in the community – mainly due to the high costs involved in obtaining these substances (this may need further verification).
Table 1: Population statistics of the community in the pilot project area
Number of working families 223 Number of non- working families 229 Male Female Family members (in working families) 531 605 Family members (in non- working families) 202 267 Number of labourers 79 113 People over 65 yrs of age 44 63 Youth (Approximately 16-25 yrs of age) 112 126 Children under 05 years 51 54 School attending children 169 217 People with dis-abilities 11 12 People who are dependent due to sicknesses etc. 10 11 Families headed by women 19 Pregnant women (If information available) 08 Families with livestock (cows/goats) 36 People engaged in other income generating activities 32
As the population statistics indicate, the community in the project area consist of persons with varying socio- economic characteristics, with reference to employment status, age and sex. The elderly and the persons with

specific needs are approximately 10% of the community, and 6.7 % are children under 5 years. Planning and execution of Anticipatory Action need to take into consideration the needs and priorities from the perspectives of those who have specific considerations, specifically:
i. Males (44) and females (63) who are over 65 yrs (7% in total)
ii. Children under 05 yrs (male 51, female 54) (6.7% in total)
iii. Males and females with special needs -those who are dependents and those with disabilities
iv. Families headed by women (4.2%)
v. Pregnant women
Each of the above groups will have specific requirements that needs to be met in them accessing and responding to early warning messages, in flood preparedness, and in flood response. Therefore, it is of critical importance that these specific requirements are identified and incorporated into AA plans and execution mechanisms. The rest of the community members extend their help to those with special needs in the times of need as a practice, however, it is important to identify these groups and their needs, and to mark appropriate measures in planning anticipatory action, engaging these groups, and others in the community in executing the actions.
Further, it is important that all groups listed in the Table 1 are consulted, specifically male and female youth, to identify the anticipatory action that are locally relevant, that enable their participation and consistent engagement.
- Inform the Grama Niladhari through official channels to get her engagement in the project activities – this request was made to the District Secretary, Nuwara Eliya, may need further follow up by IWMI at the Divisional Secretary level.
- Canal cleaning/ maintenance plan: call for a general meeting within two weeks to discuss and agree on a canal maintenance plan, including:
o Cash contributions (tentatively agreed to contribute Rs 100/- per family, per month)
o Nominate person/s to collect contributions from non-working families
o Working families to give written consent to estate management to deduct from the payroll
o Canal cleaning labour and other related expenses to be paid from the fund
o Fund to be maintained through the Welfare society
Follow up with the District DMC officials on the local early warning mechanism and form a DMC sub- committee supporting the canal cleaning.

Local early warning mechanism need to consider the groups with special needs and engage the male and female members of the youth in the community

- Women take active participation in the discussions, express their views, and come forward to take on responsibilities. Project follow up actions ensure to engage women in consultations, committees, in planning and obtaining feedback/monitoring processes.
- Further work on the canal – obtain technical specifications from the TO (who agreed to provide specifications and cost estimate in a week's time)
- Maintain communication/information exchange with the community to keep the momentum of the project activities.

Introduction
The Disruptive Seeds workstream, part of Work Package 3 of CGIAR’s Research Initiative on Climate Resilience (ClimBeR), aims to facilitate the ideation of transformative food systems change inspired by existing, promising initiatives -Seeds- that offer sustainable and just alternatives to current, unsustainable systems. After identifying such initiatives, stakeholders are then brought together to envision pathways of transformation towards “bright” future visions based on scaled versions of those seed initiatives. The Disruptive Seeds approach builds on the Seeds of Good Anthropocenes approach that was introduced by Bennett et al. (2016), by adding emphasis on an important aspect of transformational change - the role of power dynamics.
After beginning with the application of the Disruptive Seeds approach in Guatemala in 2022, ClimBeR then initiated a second intervention in Kenya in 2024. To identify promising and relevant seed initiatives and organizations that can help ‘nurture’ these seeds to grow in terms of impact and challenge the current system, or incumbent regime, we need to have a thorough understanding of Kenya’s food system, including the policy environment, its power dynamics and the challenges it faces. This report summarizes the key findings which helped refine our focus in searching for seed initiatives.
General characteristics of Kenya
Accounting for approximately 51% of Kenya’s GDP, agriculture is the most important contributor to the country’s economy. This number includes indirect contributions through links with other sectors (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2024). About 75% of the Kenyan population’s income depends on agriculture, at least partially (Alila & Atieno 2006, Government of Kenya 2015/2019). Moreover, agriculture has been instrumental in the implementation of policies for economic development and poverty reduction and plays a major role in the country’s strategy to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Government of Kenya 2019). As of 2023, the country has an estimated population of 51,525,602 inhabitants (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2024), and a total surface area of 580,367 km2. In addition to agriculture, Kenya’s economy largely depends on tourism, while the industrial sector remains underdeveloped. The country is a regional economic hub, has a primarily market-based economy, and the highest nominal GDP ($104.001 billion) in all of East and Central Africa. Its GDP per capita is an estimated $1,983 (IMF 2024). Among the most pressing economic challenges are high population growth, corruption and inflation.
Kenya was regarded as one of Africa’s most politically stable countries until 2007, when violent riots erupted following disputed elections, killing over 600 people. It also has a history of corruption, ranking 126th out of 180 nations (Transparency International 2023).
The country is home to more than 70 tribal groups, that have all influenced Kenyan culture to some degree. The major native ethnic groups are the Kikuyu (8,148,668), Luhya (6,823,842), Kalenjin (6,358,113), Luo (5,066,966), Kamba (4,663,910), Somali (2,780,502), Kisii (2,703,235), Mijikenda (2,488,691), Meru (1,975,869), Maasai (1,189,522), and Turkana (1,016,174). Sizable minorities of non-African origin include Arabs, Asians, and Europeans.
Kenya’s Current Food System
With more than 54 million inhabitants, the country is characterized by seven distinct agroecological zones, ranging from highlands and coastal regions to semi-arid lowlands. Kenyan society benefits from a diverse food system, which includes a wide range of food-related activities. The bulk of Kenya’s farmers are subsistence smallholders.

In recent decades, poverty levels have been gradually declining, in part because of various governance initiatives that have led to economic growth and in part, since 2010, due to some governance reforms. The country has also experienced progress in terms of digitization and green energy provision.
However, the food system continues to produce unequal outcomes. A sizable portion of the population lacks access to sufficient nutritious food, while smallholder farmers face restricted market access, with their land rights also threatened. Climate change, urbanization, population increase, economic modernization, government reform, digitalization, and social inequality are all key factors influencing Kenya’s food system. Additional challenges include violent, weaponized herder conflicts, such as the traditional practice of cattle rustling among pastoralist groups, which used to help prevent cattle inbreeding but has since evolved into a lethal practice linked to transnational, organized crime (Bunei et al., 2016).Moreover, in multiple parts of the country, Indigenous communities face evictions from their ancestral lands under the veil of wildlife and biodiversity conservation, such as the Ogiek people in the Mau forest—a phenomenon described as “green grabbing” (e.g., Bersaglio 2017).
According to a recent report published by Foresight4Food (De Jong et al. 2024), the Kenyan food system’s most important characteristics include the following:|
1. The population living below the poverty line has been steadily declining. However, large disparities between economic growth in different regions and significant income inequalities persist. Northern and north-eastern counties suffer most from high levels of poverty and under-nutrition.
2. Agriculture contributes the highest share of Kenya’s gross domestic product (GDP), accounting for 21.2% (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2024). Employment in agriculture has declined from 40% in 2010 to 33% in 2022 (World Bank 2022).
3. In Kenya, a growing population of youth is coming of age. At the same time, the share of the population living in urban areas has been steadily increasing up to 29.5% in 2023 (KNOEMA 2023).
4. Among certain socio-economic groups, diets are changing towards more (ultra)processed foods and animal-sourced proteins. Moreover, concerns for food safety are driving the ‘supermarketization’ of the food environment.
5. Food and nutrition insecurity has increased. Almost 70% of the population was severely or moderately food insecure in 2020. The prevalence of obesity among some population groups has also increased.
6. Kenya faces high levels of post-harvest food losses (12-20% of total national production) while being highly dependent on food imports. Kenya’s cereal import dependency ratio rose from 23.9% over the period 2000- 2002 to 43.1% in the 2019-2021 period.
7. Due to drought in recent years arising from climate change, freshwater use by Kenya’s agriculture sector has increased, with the sector responsible for roughly 80% of all freshwater withdrawals in the country between 2017 and 2020. This is related to the fact that most of Kenya’s agricultural output is grown in rain-fed farming systems, yet only 17% of the country’s arable land is deemed suitable for such production.
8. Despite greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions being comparatively low compared to industrialized countries, emissions from the food system are rising. In 2018, agricultural production was the largest contributor of GHG emissions in Kenya’s food system (83%), followed by food waste and disposal (13%).

A quick history of Kenya’s post-
colonial agricultural sector and policy
environment
From 1950 till 2010
Under British colonial rule, Kenya’s agricultural sector was characterized by well-developed export-focused settler agriculture and a neglected, marginalized, and actively repressed Indigenous smallholder sector (Fahnbulleh, 2006). This eventually sparked peasant revolts against the colonial rulers in the 1950s, as part of the wider Mau Mau uprising (Bradshaw, 1990; Hebinck, 1990; Leys, 1996). The British colonial state responded by introducing and implementing the Swynnerton Plan in 1954. This plan aimed to integrate Kenyan farmers into the new agricultural economy and develop agriculture through cash crops and intensification (Bradshaw, 1990).
Kenya’s post-colonial agricultural policy environment can be regarded as building on the Swynnerton Plan and colonial institutions (Hebinck 1990). It was characterized by a bureaucratic approach and was aimed at modernizing smallholder farming (Minot & Ngigi, 2004; Nyangito & Okello, 1998) and the promotion of new crops and technologies which included so-called ‘improved’ varieties, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery. Modernization of smallholder farming was an overall objective, as it was thought to be essential for expanding export-orientated agriculture to ensure Kenya’s agricultural sector generated foreign exchange earnings that were considered key for further industrialization and associated economic growth and for achieving food self-sufficiency (Hebinck, 1990; Lele, 1989).
In the 1970s, agricultural production growth stagnated, decreasing by one percentage point compared to the 1960s (Jabara, 1985), which was framed as a Malthusian crisis, i.e., in terms of a disbalance between population growth and agricultural production (Cox, 1984; Mosley, 1986; Orvis, 1989). This furthered the promotion of modernization of smallholder farming, increasingly modelled after the Asian Green Revolution (Escobar, 1995; Scoones & Thompson, 2011). The agricultural sector might catch up by integrating smallholders into a fast-modernizing agricultural sector, adopting technological packages, and gaining market access, according to prevalent policy rhetoric (Ajwang et al., 2022).
In the 1980s and 90s, Kenya aligned with global trends of market liberalization, as state-led development was perceived as insufficient. In consistence with guidelines of both the World Bank and the IMF, agricultural modernization was increasingly being led by private sector actors (Gitau et al., 2008; Nyangito & Okello, 1998; Anseeuw, 2010; Jayne et al., 2002; Yami & Van Asten, 2017). In the associated policy discourse, farmers were framed as individualized rational agents responding to incentives from deregulated markets (Gerdin, 2002; Gow & Parton, 1995; Sitko et al., 2017). By the year 2000, however, it became clear that neoliberal policies aimed at deregulating markets and privatization did not yield the expected results: agricultural growth had declined to 1.2% (Odhiambo et al., 2004). This prompted a number of novel policies, including the 2004 Strategy for Revitalising Agriculture (SRA) and the 2010–2020 Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) (Ajwang et al., 2022). This period was characterized by a policy discourse in which smallholders were no longer regarded as passive recipients, but still seen as aligning with modernization “as the only possible direction of development” (Ajwang et al., 2022). Smallholders’ agency to develop alternatives to the dominant agricultural system was marginalized in policy discourse; farmer-led developments and innovations (including agroecology) were largely absent in policy landscape.
Policy landscape from 2010 till the present
In August 2010, a new constitution was adopted, which included considerable land reforms (Bassett 2020). One of its main points was devolved governance: Kenya was divided into 47 independent counties with a high degree of governing autonomy. In addition, the National Land Commission was established. Its mission was to address

endemic corruption and land injustices. However, the past decade has shown that this is very complicated in a sector as complex as the land sector. To truly address these problems, Bassett argues, pressure from a “broad-based land justice/human rights movement is crucial” (Bassett 2020).
Despite new laws aimed at halting land grabbing that have been introduced since 2012, Kenya has experienced an increase in land grabbing over the past decade. According to Ambreena Manji (2020), land legislation reforms have failed to address long-lasting inequality in land distribution as a consequence of neglecting important questions of justice. Instead, she argues, land law reforms have focused on administration of land and have been concerned with bureaucratic power, while overlooking the pressing issue of inequality of land access for ordinary Kenyans.
According to rights groups including Greenpeace, the Kenyan Seed and Plant Varieties Act is an even worse example of government legislation not serving the interests of the country’s population. It requires that all seed varieties be certified, which means that big multinational companies such as Bayer Crop Science, Corteva Agriscience, Syngenta AG, and BASF SE will benefit, while many Indigenous seed varieties will be rendered illegal.
The current national-level policies in place with relevance to food systems and the environment are:
• National Environment Policy (2013) formulated by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Natural Resources
• Agricultural Policy (2021) formulated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Cooperatives
• National Food and Nutrition Security Policy (2011) formulated by the Agricultural Sector Coordination Unit
• A range of climate change focused plans, strategies and policies; see this report by the Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa (AFSA 2021).
Trends in biodiversity
Kenya is characterized by a wide range of biogeographical zones and diverse ecosystems, including lowland and mountain forests, wooded and open grasslands, semi-arid scrubland, dry woodlands, terrestrial aquatic, and coastal and marine ecosystems. These ecosystems provide diverse ecosystem services.
Wetlands are important to Kenya’s economy as they provide ecosystem services for agriculture, livestock production, energy production (through hydroelectric developments), fisheries, and tourism. Although the biodiversity of Kenya remains highly protected, there are many unprotected areas that are causing its status to quickly decline due to several threats, which has led to numerous conservation challenges. As the latest biodiversity assessments date from nearly two decades ago, there is an urgent need for re-assessing the current state of biodiversity (IUCN 2020; CBD 2024).
Forests are of utmost importance for agriculture and tourism and as such they can be considered the backbone of Kenya’s economy. In addition, they support livelihoods through the provision of food, medicine, wood for construction and fuel, and services such as water catchment areas. They perform important watershed functions, in addition to hosting high plant and animal biodiversity and endemic species. Although some high-altitude forests are well protected by their isolated positions and protected area status, others are being eroded at a fast rate (CBD 2024).
Freshwater and saline ecosystems cover about 8% of Kenya’s surface area and are important for biodiversity, food production, hydrological stability, mineral cycling and socioeconomic development. A network of freshwater and saline lakes and associated wetlands constitute vital stepping stones for migratory bird species. The biggest inland water body, Lake Victoria, produces 90% of Kenya’s total fish landings and sustains nearly half of the country’s population. Many of the inland freshwater wetlands are refuges for threatened plant and animal species, especially in the extensive semi-arid parts of Kenya.

Main threats to biodiversity
Climate change is one of the main threats to Kenya’s biodiversity. Coastal, forest and grassland ecosystems are increasingly experiencing mild to severe droughts. Other major threats to biodiversity in Kenya are anthropogenic and arise from poverty, conflict, poor land use practices, inadequate laws, policies and institutional framework, as well as poor education and inadequate involvement of the communities (National Environment Management Authority 2009). Other threats are invasive species (e.g., Nile perch and water hyacinth in Lake Victoria), land degradation and pollution, occasioned by poor land use practices. In addition, the tourism industry is encroaching on the fragile marine and coastal areas with the development of new hotels and access infrastructure (National Environment Management Authority 2009).
Conclusions
Despite governance reforms that led to some progress, the current food system in Kenya is still characterized by unequal access to safe and nutritious food, as well as restricted market access and land insecurity for subsistence smallholder farmers, who comprise the majority of Kenya’s agricultural sector. The country remains among the most corrupt in the world, ranking 126th out of 180 nations. Additionally, food and nutrition insecurity have increased, with almost 70% of the country’s population experiencing moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020. Also, lifestyle related diseases such as obesity and diabetes have increased among certain parts of the population, particularly in the urban areas. Key drivers affecting Kenya’s food system include climate change, urbanization, population increase, economic modernization, government reform, digitalization, and social inequality.
Home to a huge variety of agroecological zones, ranging from highlands and coastal regions to wetlands and semi- arid lowlands, and its high biodiversity, the country is rich in ecosystem services that are important for agriculture, livestock production and fisheries. Biodiversity, however, is facing immense threats, especially as a consequence of climate change. Droughts are important stressors for coastal, forest and grassland ecosystems. Additional anthropogenic threats arise from poverty, conflicts, poor land use practices, inadequate laws, policies and institutional framework, as well as poor education and inadequate involvement of the communities. Land degradation and pollution continuously contribute to further ecosystem deterioration.
The country remains highly dependent on food imports, while facing high levels of post-harvest losses. Ironically, a large portion of its agricultural sector is export-oriented. Policy reforms, such as Kenyan Seed and Plant Varieties Act and the establishment of the National Land Commission, were introduced to combat endemic corruption, but have little effect or -worse- work counterproductively; the Seed and Plant Varieties Act threatens Indigenous smallholders and their Indigenous crop varieties.
In addition, land grabbing remains a big issue. There has been an increase in land grabbing over the past 10 years. Also, “green grabbing”, i.e., the forced eviction of -mostly- Indigenous communities from protected forests has increased and jeopardizes the traditional livelihoods of many people.

Introduction
The Disruptive Seeds workstream, part of Work Package 3 of CGIAR’s Research Initiative on Climate Resilience (ClimBeR), aims to facilitate the ideation of transformative food systems change inspired by existing, promising initiatives -Seeds- that offer sustainable and just alternatives to current, unsustainable systems. After identifying such initiatives, stakeholders are then brought together to envision pathways of transformation towards “bright” future visions based on scaled versions of those seed initiatives. The Disruptive Seeds approach builds on the Seeds of Good Anthropocenes approach that was introduced by Bennett et al. (2016), by adding emphasis on an important aspect of transformational change - the role of power dynamics.
After beginning with the application of the Disruptive Seeds approach in Guatemala in 2022, ClimBeR then initiated a second intervention in Kenya in 2024. To identify promising and relevant seed initiatives and organizations that can help ‘nurture’ these seeds to grow in terms of impact and challenge the current system, or incumbent regime, we need to have a thorough understanding of Kenya’s food system, including the policy environment, its power dynamics and the challenges it faces. This report summarizes the key findings which helped refine our focus in searching for seed initiatives.
General characteristics of Kenya
Accounting for approximately 51% of Kenya’s GDP, agriculture is the most important contributor to the country’s economy. This number includes indirect contributions through links with other sectors (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2024). About 75% of the Kenyan population’s income depends on agriculture, at least partially (Alila & Atieno 2006, Government of Kenya 2015/2019). Moreover, agriculture has been instrumental in the implementation of policies for economic development and poverty reduction and plays a major role in the country’s strategy to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Government of Kenya 2019). As of 2023, the country has an estimated population of 51,525,602 inhabitants (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2024), and a total surface area of 580,367 km2. In addition to agriculture, Kenya’s economy largely depends on tourism, while the industrial sector remains underdeveloped. The country is a regional economic hub, has a primarily market-based economy, and the highest nominal GDP ($104.001 billion) in all of East and Central Africa. Its GDP per capita is an estimated $1,983 (IMF 2024). Among the most pressing economic challenges are high population growth, corruption and inflation.
Kenya was regarded as one of Africa’s most politically stable countries until 2007, when violent riots erupted following disputed elections, killing over 600 people. It also has a history of corruption, ranking 126th out of 180 nations (Transparency International 2023).
The country is home to more than 70 tribal groups, that have all influenced Kenyan culture to some degree. The major native ethnic groups are the Kikuyu (8,148,668), Luhya (6,823,842), Kalenjin (6,358,113), Luo (5,066,966), Kamba (4,663,910), Somali (2,780,502), Kisii (2,703,235), Mijikenda (2,488,691), Meru (1,975,869), Maasai (1,189,522), and Turkana (1,016,174). Sizable minorities of non-African origin include Arabs, Asians, and Europeans.
Kenya’s Current Food System
With more than 54 million inhabitants, the country is characterized by seven distinct agroecological zones, ranging from highlands and coastal regions to semi-arid lowlands. Kenyan society benefits from a diverse food system, which includes a wide range of food-related activities. The bulk of Kenya’s farmers are subsistence smallholders.

In recent decades, poverty levels have been gradually declining, in part because of various governance initiatives that have led to economic growth and in part, since 2010, due to some governance reforms. The country has also experienced progress in terms of digitization and green energy provision.
However, the food system continues to produce unequal outcomes. A sizable portion of the population lacks access to sufficient nutritious food, while smallholder farmers face restricted market access, with their land rights also threatened. Climate change, urbanization, population increase, economic modernization, government reform, digitalization, and social inequality are all key factors influencing Kenya’s food system. Additional challenges include violent, weaponized herder conflicts, such as the traditional practice of cattle rustling among pastoralist groups, which used to help prevent cattle inbreeding but has since evolved into a lethal practice linked to transnational, organized crime (Bunei et al., 2016).Moreover, in multiple parts of the country, Indigenous communities face evictions from their ancestral lands under the veil of wildlife and biodiversity conservation, such as the Ogiek people in the Mau forest—a phenomenon described as “green grabbing” (e.g., Bersaglio 2017).
According to a recent report published by Foresight4Food (De Jong et al. 2024), the Kenyan food system’s most important characteristics include the following:|
1. The population living below the poverty line has been steadily declining. However, large disparities between economic growth in different regions and significant income inequalities persist. Northern and north-eastern counties suffer most from high levels of poverty and under-nutrition.
2. Agriculture contributes the highest share of Kenya’s gross domestic product (GDP), accounting for 21.2% (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2024). Employment in agriculture has declined from 40% in 2010 to 33% in 2022 (World Bank 2022).
3. In Kenya, a growing population of youth is coming of age. At the same time, the share of the population living in urban areas has been steadily increasing up to 29.5% in 2023 (KNOEMA 2023).
4. Among certain socio-economic groups, diets are changing towards more (ultra)processed foods and animal-sourced proteins. Moreover, concerns for food safety are driving the ‘supermarketization’ of the food environment.
5. Food and nutrition insecurity has increased. Almost 70% of the population was severely or moderately food insecure in 2020. The prevalence of obesity among some population groups has also increased.
6. Kenya faces high levels of post-harvest food losses (12-20% of total national production) while being highly dependent on food imports. Kenya’s cereal import dependency ratio rose from 23.9% over the period 2000- 2002 to 43.1% in the 2019-2021 period.
7. Due to drought in recent years arising from climate change, freshwater use by Kenya’s agriculture sector has increased, with the sector responsible for roughly 80% of all freshwater withdrawals in the country between 2017 and 2020. This is related to the fact that most of Kenya’s agricultural output is grown in rain-fed farming systems, yet only 17% of the country’s arable land is deemed suitable for such production.
8. Despite greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions being comparatively low compared to industrialized countries, emissions from the food system are rising. In 2018, agricultural production was the largest contributor of GHG emissions in Kenya’s food system (83%), followed by food waste and disposal (13%).

A quick history of Kenya’s post-
colonial agricultural sector and policy
environment
From 1950 till 2010
Under British colonial rule, Kenya’s agricultural sector was characterized by well-developed export-focused settler agriculture and a neglected, marginalized, and actively repressed Indigenous smallholder sector (Fahnbulleh, 2006). This eventually sparked peasant revolts against the colonial rulers in the 1950s, as part of the wider Mau Mau uprising (Bradshaw, 1990; Hebinck, 1990; Leys, 1996). The British colonial state responded by introducing and implementing the Swynnerton Plan in 1954. This plan aimed to integrate Kenyan farmers into the new agricultural economy and develop agriculture through cash crops and intensification (Bradshaw, 1990).
Kenya’s post-colonial agricultural policy environment can be regarded as building on the Swynnerton Plan and colonial institutions (Hebinck 1990). It was characterized by a bureaucratic approach and was aimed at modernizing smallholder farming (Minot & Ngigi, 2004; Nyangito & Okello, 1998) and the promotion of new crops and technologies which included so-called ‘improved’ varieties, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery. Modernization of smallholder farming was an overall objective, as it was thought to be essential for expanding export-orientated agriculture to ensure Kenya’s agricultural sector generated foreign exchange earnings that were considered key for further industrialization and associated economic growth and for achieving food self-sufficiency (Hebinck, 1990; Lele, 1989).
In the 1970s, agricultural production growth stagnated, decreasing by one percentage point compared to the 1960s (Jabara, 1985), which was framed as a Malthusian crisis, i.e., in terms of a disbalance between population growth and agricultural production (Cox, 1984; Mosley, 1986; Orvis, 1989). This furthered the promotion of modernization of smallholder farming, increasingly modelled after the Asian Green Revolution (Escobar, 1995; Scoones & Thompson, 2011). The agricultural sector might catch up by integrating smallholders into a fast-modernizing agricultural sector, adopting technological packages, and gaining market access, according to prevalent policy rhetoric (Ajwang et al., 2022).
In the 1980s and 90s, Kenya aligned with global trends of market liberalization, as state-led development was perceived as insufficient. In consistence with guidelines of both the World Bank and the IMF, agricultural modernization was increasingly being led by private sector actors (Gitau et al., 2008; Nyangito & Okello, 1998; Anseeuw, 2010; Jayne et al., 2002; Yami & Van Asten, 2017). In the associated policy discourse, farmers were framed as individualized rational agents responding to incentives from deregulated markets (Gerdin, 2002; Gow & Parton, 1995; Sitko et al., 2017). By the year 2000, however, it became clear that neoliberal policies aimed at deregulating markets and privatization did not yield the expected results: agricultural growth had declined to 1.2% (Odhiambo et al., 2004). This prompted a number of novel policies, including the 2004 Strategy for Revitalising Agriculture (SRA) and the 2010–2020 Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) (Ajwang et al., 2022). This period was characterized by a policy discourse in which smallholders were no longer regarded as passive recipients, but still seen as aligning with modernization “as the only possible direction of development” (Ajwang et al., 2022). Smallholders’ agency to develop alternatives to the dominant agricultural system was marginalized in policy discourse; farmer-led developments and innovations (including agroecology) were largely absent in policy landscape.
Policy landscape from 2010 till the present
In August 2010, a new constitution was adopted, which included considerable land reforms (Bassett 2020). One of its main points was devolved governance: Kenya was divided into 47 independent counties with a high degree of governing autonomy. In addition, the National Land Commission was established. Its mission was to address

endemic corruption and land injustices. However, the past decade has shown that this is very complicated in a sector as complex as the land sector. To truly address these problems, Bassett argues, pressure from a “broad-based land justice/human rights movement is crucial” (Bassett 2020).
Despite new laws aimed at halting land grabbing that have been introduced since 2012, Kenya has experienced an increase in land grabbing over the past decade. According to Ambreena Manji (2020), land legislation reforms have failed to address long-lasting inequality in land distribution as a consequence of neglecting important questions of justice. Instead, she argues, land law reforms have focused on administration of land and have been concerned with bureaucratic power, while overlooking the pressing issue of inequality of land access for ordinary Kenyans.
According to rights groups including Greenpeace, the Kenyan Seed and Plant Varieties Act is an even worse example of government legislation not serving the interests of the country’s population. It requires that all seed varieties be certified, which means that big multinational companies such as Bayer Crop Science, Corteva Agriscience, Syngenta AG, and BASF SE will benefit, while many Indigenous seed varieties will be rendered illegal.
The current national-level policies in place with relevance to food systems and the environment are:
• National Environment Policy (2013) formulated by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Natural Resources
• Agricultural Policy (2021) formulated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Cooperatives
• National Food and Nutrition Security Policy (2011) formulated by the Agricultural Sector Coordination Unit
• A range of climate change focused plans, strategies and policies; see this report by the Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa (AFSA 2021).
Trends in biodiversity
Kenya is characterized by a wide range of biogeographical zones and diverse ecosystems, including lowland and mountain forests, wooded and open grasslands, semi-arid scrubland, dry woodlands, terrestrial aquatic, and coastal and marine ecosystems. These ecosystems provide diverse ecosystem services.
Wetlands are important to Kenya’s economy as they provide ecosystem services for agriculture, livestock production, energy production (through hydroelectric developments), fisheries, and tourism. Although the biodiversity of Kenya remains highly protected, there are many unprotected areas that are causing its status to quickly decline due to several threats, which has led to numerous conservation challenges. As the latest biodiversity assessments date from nearly two decades ago, there is an urgent need for re-assessing the current state of biodiversity (IUCN 2020; CBD 2024).
Forests are of utmost importance for agriculture and tourism and as such they can be considered the backbone of Kenya’s economy. In addition, they support livelihoods through the provision of food, medicine, wood for construction and fuel, and services such as water catchment areas. They perform important watershed functions, in addition to hosting high plant and animal biodiversity and endemic species. Although some high-altitude forests are well protected by their isolated positions and protected area status, others are being eroded at a fast rate (CBD 2024).
Freshwater and saline ecosystems cover about 8% of Kenya’s surface area and are important for biodiversity, food production, hydrological stability, mineral cycling and socioeconomic development. A network of freshwater and saline lakes and associated wetlands constitute vital stepping stones for migratory bird species. The biggest inland water body, Lake Victoria, produces 90% of Kenya’s total fish landings and sustains nearly half of the country’s population. Many of the inland freshwater wetlands are refuges for threatened plant and animal species, especially in the extensive semi-arid parts of Kenya.

Main threats to biodiversity
Climate change is one of the main threats to Kenya’s biodiversity. Coastal, forest and grassland ecosystems are increasingly experiencing mild to severe droughts. Other major threats to biodiversity in Kenya are anthropogenic and arise from poverty, conflict, poor land use practices, inadequate laws, policies and institutional framework, as well as poor education and inadequate involvement of the communities (National Environment Management Authority 2009). Other threats are invasive species (e.g., Nile perch and water hyacinth in Lake Victoria), land degradation and pollution, occasioned by poor land use practices. In addition, the tourism industry is encroaching on the fragile marine and coastal areas with the development of new hotels and access infrastructure (National Environment Management Authority 2009).
Conclusions
Despite governance reforms that led to some progress, the current food system in Kenya is still characterized by unequal access to safe and nutritious food, as well as restricted market access and land insecurity for subsistence smallholder farmers, who comprise the majority of Kenya’s agricultural sector. The country remains among the most corrupt in the world, ranking 126th out of 180 nations. Additionally, food and nutrition insecurity have increased, with almost 70% of the country’s population experiencing moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020. Also, lifestyle related diseases such as obesity and diabetes have increased among certain parts of the population, particularly in the urban areas. Key drivers affecting Kenya’s food system include climate change, urbanization, population increase, economic modernization, government reform, digitalization, and social inequality.
Home to a huge variety of agroecological zones, ranging from highlands and coastal regions to wetlands and semi- arid lowlands, and its high biodiversity, the country is rich in ecosystem services that are important for agriculture, livestock production and fisheries. Biodiversity, however, is facing immense threats, especially as a consequence of climate change. Droughts are important stressors for coastal, forest and grassland ecosystems. Additional anthropogenic threats arise from poverty, conflicts, poor land use practices, inadequate laws, policies and institutional framework, as well as poor education and inadequate involvement of the communities. Land degradation and pollution continuously contribute to further ecosystem deterioration.
The country remains highly dependent on food imports, while facing high levels of post-harvest losses. Ironically, a large portion of its agricultural sector is export-oriented. Policy reforms, such as Kenyan Seed and Plant Varieties Act and the establishment of the National Land Commission, were introduced to combat endemic corruption, but have little effect or -worse- work counterproductively; the Seed and Plant Varieties Act threatens Indigenous smallholders and their Indigenous crop varieties.
In addition, land grabbing remains a big issue. There has been an increase in land grabbing over the past 10 years. Also, “green grabbing”, i.e., the forced eviction of -mostly- Indigenous communities from protected forests has increased and jeopardizes the traditional livelihoods of many people.

• Indigenous People and family farms are the building blocks
• International cooperation is the catalyst to increase investments
• Leverage incentives to co-design local solutions and investment for scaling out AE solutions

We call on researchers, practitioners, and Parties to the CBD to break down sectoral silos and tackle complex food and biodiversity challenges using inter- and trans- disciplinary methods that equitably integrate diverse local concerns, preferences and needs.
We call on Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to facilitate an agroecological transition by creating a supportive policy, regulatory, and financial environment, and investing in agrobiodiversity conservation from farm to plate.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Globally, agricultural land and aquatic ecosystems are highly threatened and concerted efforts by agricultural authorities, governments and civil society to ‘turn the situation around’ are simply not working. Food, water quality and quantity remain a top priority for human well-being. This scenario is especially relevant within the water, energy and food nexus where agroecology can make a significant contribution. Human created problems require human- centred solutions and these require different ways of thinking and acting to those behaviour patterns that are contributing to the challenges.
It has been a privilege to visit the Agroecology Living Landscapes (ALLs) and general agroecology movements in Zimbabwe and Kenya. A significant Community of Practice (CoP) is clearly developing, and considerable commitment and enthusiasm is evident across all the people that were met, and places visited. As a fact finding and feasibility team, the project team were able to visit farmers, in the field, at their homes and at other nearby venues. Support from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF) is very evident as is the active and positive support from government such as through the agricultural extension services.
It is evident that agroecology offers a promising approach to strengthen, and even revolutionise, smallholder farming and agriculture. Unfortunately, the widespread adoption and the assessment of agroecology is hindered by a lack of data and a lack of awareness of the potential of agroecology. A wider mobilisation of farmers around the principles and practices of agroecology could be of enormous value to sustainable agriculture. Globally, co- created citizen science initiatives have been gaining popularity and are useful for generating data, and commitment, on a range of environmental and agricultural parameters. Citizen science approaches are also able to offer a mobilising potential that could have far-reaching effects in agroecology. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of developing a citizen science-based Agroecology Self-Assessment (ASA) framework. The study concludes that the ASA tool is undoubtably needed and should include relevant practical assessment tools as well as other appropriate artificial intelligence support and networked learning processes. Clearly what is required, and is proposed here, is wider support for agroecology and this support could include an ASA program. The proposed ASA program is aligned to, and supportive of, agroecological principles.
This proposed ASA program encompasses both physical and digital tools that can be used to assess agroecological practices and has the potential to address gaps related to agroecology performance assessments, data generation and knowledge-sharing. Furthermore, the program could lead to the development of a citizen science community of practice to empower smallholder farmers to collaborate and share both new and indigenous knowledge practices. Through fieldwork in Kenya and Zimbabwe, the feasibility of using a mobile application to both collect data on various agroecological indicators, such as soil health, biodiversity, and water management, as well as socioeconomic factors related to agroecology was investigated. The findings from the fieldwork have shown that there is interest in the use of citizen-science tools to complement agroecological practices.
The conceptual design and framework for the ASA program was developed using the information from a desktop- based literature review and findings from discussions with smallholder farmers, researchers and agricultural extension officers in Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. It is envisaged that the ASA program, once developed, will provide farmers with personalised feedback based on household and field assessments, foster knowledge sharing and enable evidence-based decision-making. By leveraging the power of co-created citizen science solutions, these processes are designed to build capacity, generate data on agroecology and promote sustainable agricultural practices. These will undoubtably improve food security and contribute to the global effort towards more resilient and equitable food systems.
Like any developing CoP, there are many opportunities for strengthening the work that is being done. Although the initial insights in this report are necessarily tentative, and could do with further verification and ground truthing, the project team is confident to co-explore a number of possibilities within the CGIAR initiative on Agroecology. CoPs could be developed through a greater commitment to the Tools, Rules and Stakeholder engagements that were investigated and reported on in this document.
6
The Tools could include a widening array of materials, resources, activities and actual physical tools that already exist or that could be co-developed, or further co-developed, with farmers and other support role-players (stakeholders). In particular the enhanced use of digital tools and social media is proposed. This could be achieved through a linkage of digital agroecology self-assessments, and networked learning and action via a ‘knowledge and practice’ information portal supported by a simple and accessible mobile phone application (app). These could be complemented by a deepening understanding of the Rules or Policy practices. These rules include, but are not limited to, the principles of agroecology, policies (Global, Regional i.e. SADC, etc., National as well as Tribal Leadership areas), many of which are well placed to support agroecology and with a little more situated learning and exposure to them could build considerable confidence and even greater commitment from the farmers and other role-players in the food-system.
The developing Community of Practice could benefit from the proposed Agroecology Self-Assessment (ASA) program and the CoP would allow key participants, from within the movement, to attend relevant courses on agroecology transitions and performance assessments. Such support courses could take the form of face-to-face co- engaged meetings, WhatsApp support interactions with YouTube style videos, as well as online and social learning through communication channels and Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots 1. The fieldwork team discovered, for example, that the Meta Bot (embedded within WhatsApp) was excellent at supporting rural farmers to establish which crops were drought resistant and how to cultivate them! The ultimate goal would be to co-develop practical assessments (for both the household and at a field level) and respond to training needs and opportunities, possibly through a simplified power-mapping process, with participants. Power-mapping is a process where participants articulate their influence (or power) and then identify where their knowledge and practices may be lacking and, therefore, in need of wider support. When these needs are co-identified with participants, the processes linked to the design of solutions are human-centred and are much more likely to be effective and sustainable. A vision of Agroecology Champions, possibly known as Agrochamps (the actual name is not important), selected from within the agroecology community, co-supporting others, could well be a good option to develop as well.

1. INTRODUCTION
Agroecology may be described as a science, set of practices, and social movement that offers a transformative approach to change agricultural and food systems (Wezel et al., 2020). Agroecology is a multifaceted concept that evolved from a purely scientific discipline to encompass agricultural practices and social movements and initially focused only on crop production (Thomas and Kevan, 1993). However, it now addresses broader environmental, social, and economic concerns (Thomas and Kevan, 1993). Agroecology and associated science-based approaches, such as agroforestry, to sustainable agriculture have gained significant traction in recent years (Leakey et al., 2021). A potential reason for this is that agroecology recognises the interconnection between ecological processes as well as social and economic factors within agricultural systems. By integrating traditional and scientific knowledge, agroecology seeks to create sustainable, resilient, and equitable food systems (Leakey, 2014).
For this research, the concept of ""living landscapes"" is closely aligned with agroecology. The concept of living landscapes envisions agricultural landscapes as dynamic ecosystems that support biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services, and provide a variety of benefits for both people and the planet. The current research may be coupled with “knowledge-scapes”2 because they offer more informed ways of understanding the living landscapes. Hence, the land is viewed holistically and is managed with people, and not as a tool to produce crops and livestock. Furthermore, by fostering agricultural processes and practices, such as natural nutrient cycling, pollination, and pest control, that are in harmony with the environment, Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALLs) can contribute to improved food production and food security, climate change mitigation, water conservation, and improved, soil, crop, animal and human health.
The governing principles of agroecology emphasise sustainable practices such as recycling, reducing inputs, and prioritising soil and animal health. These principles provide pathways for incremental and transformative change towards sustainable agricultural and food systems. (Wezel et al., 2020). Furthermore, by fostering biodiversity gains, synergy, and economic diversification, agroecology promotes resilient and equitable food systems. However, the co-creation of knowledge, social values, and fair governance are integral to the successful implementation of agroecology (Wezel et al., 2020).
Citizen science, or community science, enables all people, regardless of their academic training or lack of it, to engage in finding out about the world around them and to take action accordingly (Graham and Taylor, 2018a; Taylor et al., 2022; Pattinson et al., 2023a). These processes, sometimes referred to as the democratisation of science, enable communities to play an active role in finding out about and taking informed action to manage the environment around them.
“Citizen science in Africa is a great way to gather scarce data from areas that are not easily accessible. The way Enviro- Champs operates generates potential for creating small enterprises based on circular principles.” - Dr Henry Roman, IWMI, Regional Representative for Southern Africa
Citizen science is especially useful in agroecological contexts where active, co-engaged research is at the forefront of practices. Hence, by collaborating with farmers and all relevant stakeholders to co-create an Agroecology Self- Assessment (ASA) program and by engaging farmers in data collection and analysis, citizen science can enable communities to assess the level of success of their agroecological transitions, assess the performance of practices aligned with agroecology, democratise knowledge production, and empower communities to address local challenges. Citizen science projects can provide valuable insights into agricultural practices, biodiversity, and ecosystem health (Pattinson et al., 2023a). Hence, the vision of the ASA program is to put the tools of science into the hands of those that make decisions on a daily basis, i.e. smallholder farmers, and community members.
Self-assessments are a powerful tool for farmers and various stakeholders along the food system to evaluate their current practices and identify areas for improvement. When supported by simple physical tools, such as a rain gauge, or co-engagement tools like ‘power-mapping’, farmers can evaluate their own performance and chart and influence their own learning (Graham and Taylor, 2018a). By understanding their strengths and weaknesses,
2 The ultimate goal would be to translate landscapes to “knowledge-scapes” and ultimately “action-scapes” that consider the environment and food systems holistically.
8
stakeholders can make informed decisions to transition towards more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. Therefore, self-assessment can also help farmers to benchmark their progress, track changes over time, and share their experiences with others. Naturally, doing this requires tools and simple citizen science tools and power- mapping are only examples of these tools. Additional tools to evaluate practices against the agroecology principles, for e.g. to analyse soil properties, better measure water and produce quality, and improve market linkages, are all required to successfully implement the ASA program.
Several successful citizen science initiatives have demonstrated the power of public participation in scientific research. For example, the South African Scoring System (SASS) and its simplified version, The Stream Assessment Scoring System or miniSASS, have engaged hundreds of volunteers in monitoring macroinvertebrate populations to infer water quality across the globe (Dickens and Graham, 2002; Graham et al., 2004). Other notable examples include the use of clarity tubes, velocity planks, and various agricultural and public health citizen science projects that have been successfully implemented (Graham et al., 2023; Graham et al., 2024).
This project aims to develop a framework for a citizen science application and a set of tools to enable farmers to assess their agroecological performance to enable more efficient and sustainable transition to agroecology. By leveraging the principles of agroecology and the power of citizen science, this project seeks to co-create and co- develop a framework for a program that:
(a) Provides smallholder farmers with the knowledge and tools to assess their agroecological practices.
(b) Encourages the adoption of agroecological principles and practices.
(c) Fosters the creation of sustainable living landscapes and collaboration between smallholder farmers.
(d) Generates valuable data on agricultural practices and environmental conditions.
In the following sections of this document, an introduction to the project and a synthesis of relevant literature on agroecology, citizen science, and self-assessment tools is provided. The literature review is followed by the methodology used to develop the framework for the development of the citizen science application and tools. Thereafter, the results and conceptual design of the ASA program is provided. This is followed by a brief conclusion and a discussion related to the implications of the project as well as recommendations and the potential for future research based on the findings of this study.
2. BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW
In this section of the report, an overview of agroecology, citizen science and social change are provided.
2.1 The Need to Assess and Evaluate Agroecology
Agroecology is a multifaceted concept, but the concept evolved from a purely scientific discipline to encompass agricultural practices and social movements. The historical development of agroecology, particularly in countries such as the United States of America (USA), Brazil, Germany, and France, highlight its diverse interpretations where certain countries recognise agroecology as a scientific field and others emphasise the practical applications and social implications of agroecology (Thomas and Kevan, 1993). Nevertheless, agroecology may be seen as a science, set of practices, and social movement, that offers a transformative approach to food systems (Wezel et al., 2020).
Agrifood systems are complex and interconnected and have the ability to influence various aspects of our lives. To understand and improve these systems, it is, therefore, crucial to measure and assess their performance. However, the diversity of agrifood systems and the multitude of assessment objectives make it challenging to develop a single, universally applicable agroecological assessment framework (Lamanna et al., 2024). According to Geck et al. (2023), traditional agroecological performance metrics often focus on productivity and profitability, neglecting other crucial aspects such as environmental and social impacts
To address challenges related to measuring the performance of food systems, Lamanna et al. (2024) proposed a meta-framework to guide the development of holistic agrifood system assessments. This meta-framework outlines a step-by-step process for designing assessments that are tailored to specific needs and objectives and provides principles to assist in selecting appropriate metrics and methodologies, ensuring that the assessments are comprehensive, relevant, and actionable. Lamanna et al. (2024) states that by following this framework, researchers,
9
policymakers, and practitioners can develop effective assessments that contribute to the sustainability and resilience of agrifood systems.
Geck et al. (2023) emphasised the importance of developing agroecology assessment approaches that are both globally comparable and locally relevant. The Holistic Localised Performance Assessment (HOLPA) tool is a comprehensive framework for assessing the multidimensional performance of agroecological systems at the household, field, farm, and landscape levels (Jones et al., 2024). The aim of HOLPA assessments is to capture a wide range of indicators, including economic, environmental, and social factors, and the HOLPA tool has been designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, allowing for local customisation while maintaining global comparability. By incorporating a localisation process, HOLPA ensures that assessments are relevant to local needs and priorities. This approach enables a more nuanced understanding of agroecological practices and their impact on sustainable development (Jones et al., 2024).
2.2 The Principles of Agroecology
Agroecology is a multifaceted concept that encompasses ecological, social, and economic dimensions (van Dien and Fuchs, 2023). The key aim of agroecology is to create sustainable and equitable food systems by fostering harmonious relationships between people, nature, and animals. The 13 principles of agroecology, outlined by the High-Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE), provide a framework for guiding agroecological practices (HLPE, 2019). These principles emphasise resource efficiency, resilience, and social justice by promoting practices such as recycling, biodiversity conservation, and fair governance (HLPE, 2019).
Agroecology emphasises sustainable practices such as recycling, reducing inputs, and prioritising soil and animal health. When these practices are applied correctly, they can also foster biodiversity gains, synergy, and economic diversification. Therefore, agroecology promotes resilient and equitable food systems and the co-creation of knowledge, social values, and fair governance. The HLPE principles of agroecology are also aligned with the 10 elements of agroecology identified by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and provide pathways for incremental and transformative change towards sustainable agriculture and food systems (Wezel et al., 2020).
Agroecology is a holistic approach to agriculture that integrates ecological principles with the social and economic facets of agriculture. The core tenets of agroecology encompass the promotion of socially equitable and resilient food systems, as well as the optimisation and strengthening of resource use for agricultural purposes (HLPE, 2019). The 13 principles of agroecology provide a framework for transitioning towards sustainable, fair, and equitable agricultural practices (HLPE, 2019). However, to operationalise the agroecological principles a combination of scientific methodologies and participatory approaches are required. This will involve a multidisciplinary approach, drawing upon experience in ecology, agriculture, engineering, soil science, agronomy, economics, and sociology.
The HOLPA tool has been designed to evaluate how a farm performs according to the environmental, social, economic, and political dimensions of agroecology (Jones et al., 2024). To ensure its adaptability and relevance, HOLPA includes both globally applicable and locally specific metrices for evidence-based decision","Development of a framework for a citizen science-based Agroecology Self-Assessment (ASA) program  The following text section comes from a specific evidence file named URL https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169821: ""Development of a framework for a citizen science-based Agroecology Self-Assessment (ASA) program Skip to main content Communities & Collections Browse Navigate CGIAR Centers Statistics English Catal e tina Deutsch Espa ol Fran ais G idhlig Italiano Latvie u Magyar Nederlands Polski Portugu s Portugu s do Brasil Srpski (lat) Suomi Svenska T rk e Ti ng Vi t Y Log In Note: CGIAR users should log in with their Active Directory username and password.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Globally, agricultural land and aquatic ecosystems are highly threatened and concerted efforts by agricultural authorities, governments and civil society to ‘turn the situation around’ are simply not working. Food, water quality and quantity remain a top priority for human well-being. This scenario is especially relevant within the water, energy and food nexus where agroecology can make a significant contribution. Human created problems require human- centred solutions and these require different ways of thinking and acting to those behaviour patterns that are contributing to the challenges.
It has been a privilege to visit the Agroecology Living Landscapes (ALLs) and general agroecology movements in Zimbabwe and Kenya. A significant Community of Practice (CoP) is clearly developing, and considerable commitment and enthusiasm is evident across all the people that were met, and places visited. As a fact finding and feasibility team, the project team were able to visit farmers, in the field, at their homes and at other nearby venues. Support from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF) is very evident as is the active and positive support from government such as through the agricultural extension services.
It is evident that agroecology offers a promising approach to strengthen, and even revolutionise, smallholder farming and agriculture. Unfortunately, the widespread adoption and the assessment of agroecology is hindered by a lack of data and a lack of awareness of the potential of agroecology. A wider mobilisation of farmers around the principles and practices of agroecology could be of enormous value to sustainable agriculture. Globally, co- created citizen science initiatives have been gaining popularity and are useful for generating data, and commitment, on a range of environmental and agricultural parameters. Citizen science approaches are also able to offer a mobilising potential that could have far-reaching effects in agroecology. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of developing a citizen science-based Agroecology Self-Assessment (ASA) framework. The study concludes that the ASA tool is undoubtably needed and should include relevant practical assessment tools as well as other appropriate artificial intelligence support and networked learning processes. Clearly what is required, and is proposed here, is wider support for agroecology and this support could include an ASA program. The proposed ASA program is aligned to, and supportive of, agroecological principles.
This proposed ASA program encompasses both physical and digital tools that can be used to assess agroecological practices and has the potential to address gaps related to agroecology performance assessments, data generation and knowledge-sharing. Furthermore, the program could lead to the development of a citizen science community of practice to empower smallholder farmers to collaborate and share both new and indigenous knowledge practices. Through fieldwork in Kenya and Zimbabwe, the feasibility of using a mobile application to both collect data on various agroecological indicators, such as soil health, biodiversity, and water management, as well as socioeconomic factors related to agroecology was investigated. The findings from the fieldwork have shown that there is interest in the use of citizen-science tools to complement agroecological practices.
The conceptual design and framework for the ASA program was developed using the information from a desktop- based literature review and findings from discussions with smallholder farmers, researchers and agricultural extension officers in Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. It is envisaged that the ASA program, once developed, will provide farmers with personalised feedback based on household and field assessments, foster knowledge sharing and enable evidence-based decision-making. By leveraging the power of co-created citizen science solutions, these processes are designed to build capacity, generate data on agroecology and promote sustainable agricultural practices. These will undoubtably improve food security and contribute to the global effort towards more resilient and equitable food systems.
Like any developing CoP, there are many opportunities for strengthening the work that is being done. Although the initial insights in this report are necessarily tentative, and could do with further verification and ground truthing, the project team is confident to co-explore a number of possibilities within the CGIAR initiative on Agroecology. CoPs could be developed through a greater commitment to the Tools, Rules and Stakeholder engagements that were investigated and reported on in this document.
6
The Tools could include a widening array of materials, resources, activities and actual physical tools that already exist or that could be co-developed, or further co-developed, with farmers and other support role-players (stakeholders). In particular the enhanced use of digital tools and social media is proposed. This could be achieved through a linkage of digital agroecology self-assessments, and networked learning and action via a ‘knowledge and practice’ information portal supported by a simple and accessible mobile phone application (app). These could be complemented by a deepening understanding of the Rules or Policy practices. These rules include, but are not limited to, the principles of agroecology, policies (Global, Regional i.e. SADC, etc., National as well as Tribal Leadership areas), many of which are well placed to support agroecology and with a little more situated learning and exposure to them could build considerable confidence and even greater commitment from the farmers and other role-players in the food-system.
The developing Community of Practice could benefit from the proposed Agroecology Self-Assessment (ASA) program and the CoP would allow key participants, from within the movement, to attend relevant courses on agroecology transitions and performance assessments. Such support courses could take the form of face-to-face co- engaged meetings, WhatsApp support interactions with YouTube style videos, as well as online and social learning through communication channels and Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots 1. The fieldwork team discovered, for example, that the Meta Bot (embedded within WhatsApp) was excellent at supporting rural farmers to establish which crops were drought resistant and how to cultivate them! The ultimate goal would be to co-develop practical assessments (for both the household and at a field level) and respond to training needs and opportunities, possibly through a simplified power-mapping process, with participants. Power-mapping is a process where participants articulate their influence (or power) and then identify where their knowledge and practices may be lacking and, therefore, in need of wider support. When these needs are co-identified with participants, the processes linked to the design of solutions are human-centred and are much more likely to be effective and sustainable. A vision of Agroecology Champions, possibly known as Agrochamps (the actual name is not important), selected from within the agroecology community, co-supporting others, could well be a good option to develop as well.

1. INTRODUCTION
Agroecology may be described as a science, set of practices, and social movement that offers a transformative approach to change agricultural and food systems (Wezel et al., 2020). Agroecology is a multifaceted concept that evolved from a purely scientific discipline to encompass agricultural practices and social movements and initially focused only on crop production (Thomas and Kevan, 1993). However, it now addresses broader environmental, social, and economic concerns (Thomas and Kevan, 1993). Agroecology and associated science-based approaches, such as agroforestry, to sustainable agriculture have gained significant traction in recent years (Leakey et al., 2021). A potential reason for this is that agroecology recognises the interconnection between ecological processes as well as social and economic factors within agricultural systems. By integrating traditional and scientific knowledge, agroecology seeks to create sustainable, resilient, and equitable food systems (Leakey, 2014).
For this research, the concept of ""living landscapes"" is closely aligned with agroecology. The concept of living landscapes envisions agricultural landscapes as dynamic ecosystems that support biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services, and provide a variety of benefits for both people and the planet. The current research may be coupled with “knowledge-scapes”2 because they offer more informed ways of understanding the living landscapes. Hence, the land is viewed holistically and is managed with people, and not as a tool to produce crops and livestock. Furthermore, by fostering agricultural processes and practices, such as natural nutrient cycling, pollination, and pest control, that are in harmony with the environment, Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALLs) can contribute to improved food production and food security, climate change mitigation, water conservation, and improved, soil, crop, animal and human health.
The governing principles of agroecology emphasise sustainable practices such as recycling, reducing inputs, and prioritising soil and animal health. These principles provide pathways for incremental and transformative change towards sustainable agricultural and food systems. (Wezel et al., 2020). Furthermore, by fostering biodiversity gains, synergy, and economic diversification, agroecology promotes resilient and equitable food systems. However, the co-creation of knowledge, social values, and fair governance are integral to the successful implementation of agroecology (Wezel et al., 2020).
Citizen science, or community science, enables all people, regardless of their academic training or lack of it, to engage in finding out about the world around them and to take action accordingly (Graham and Taylor, 2018a; Taylor et al., 2022; Pattinson et al., 2023a). These processes, sometimes referred to as the democratisation of science, enable communities to play an active role in finding out about and taking informed action to manage the environment around them.
“Citizen science in Africa is a great way to gather scarce data from areas that are not easily accessible. The way Enviro- Champs operates generates potential for creating small enterprises based on circular principles.” - Dr Henry Roman, IWMI, Regional Representative for Southern Africa
Citizen science is especially useful in agroecological contexts where active, co-engaged research is at the forefront of practices. Hence, by collaborating with farmers and all relevant stakeholders to co-create an Agroecology Self- Assessment (ASA) program and by engaging farmers in data collection and analysis, citizen science can enable communities to assess the level of success of their agroecological transitions, assess the performance of practices aligned with agroecology, democratise knowledge production, and empower communities to address local challenges. Citizen science projects can provide valuable insights into agricultural practices, biodiversity, and ecosystem health (Pattinson et al., 2023a). Hence, the vision of the ASA program is to put the tools of science into the hands of those that make decisions on a daily basis, i.e. smallholder farmers, and community members.
Self-assessments are a powerful tool for farmers and various stakeholders along the food system to evaluate their current practices and identify areas for improvement. When supported by simple physical tools, such as a rain gauge, or co-engagement tools like ‘power-mapping’, farmers can evaluate their own performance and chart and influence their own learning (Graham and Taylor, 2018a). By understanding their strengths and weaknesses,
2 The ultimate goal would be to translate landscapes to “knowledge-scapes” and ultimately “action-scapes” that consider the environment and food systems holistically.
8
stakeholders can make informed decisions to transition towards more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. Therefore, self-assessment can also help farmers to benchmark their progress, track changes over time, and share their experiences with others. Naturally, doing this requires tools and simple citizen science tools and power- mapping are only examples of these tools. Additional tools to evaluate practices against the agroecology principles, for e.g. to analyse soil properties, better measure water and produce quality, and improve market linkages, are all required to successfully implement the ASA program.
Several successful citizen science initiatives have demonstrated the power of public participation in scientific research. For example, the South African Scoring System (SASS) and its simplified version, The Stream Assessment Scoring System or miniSASS, have engaged hundreds of volunteers in monitoring macroinvertebrate populations to infer water quality across the globe (Dickens and Graham, 2002; Graham et al., 2004). Other notable examples include the use of clarity tubes, velocity planks, and various agricultural and public health citizen science projects that have been successfully implemented (Graham et al., 2023; Graham et al., 2024).
This project aims to develop a framework for a citizen science application and a set of tools to enable farmers to assess their agroecological performance to enable more efficient and sustainable transition to agroecology. By leveraging the principles of agroecology and the power of citizen science, this project seeks to co-create and co- develop a framework for a program that:
(a) Provides smallholder farmers with the knowledge and tools to assess their agroecological practices.
(b) Encourages the adoption of agroecological principles and practices.
(c) Fosters the creation of sustainable living landscapes and collaboration between smallholder farmers.
(d) Generates valuable data on agricultural practices and environmental conditions.
In the following sections of this document, an introduction to the project and a synthesis of relevant literature on agroecology, citizen science, and self-assessment tools is provided. The literature review is followed by the methodology used to develop the framework for the development of the citizen science application and tools. Thereafter, the results and conceptual design of the ASA program is provided. This is followed by a brief conclusion and a discussion related to the implications of the project as well as recommendations and the potential for future research based on the findings of this study.
2. BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW
In this section of the report, an overview of agroecology, citizen science and social change are provided.
2.1 The Need to Assess and Evaluate Agroecology
Agroecology is a multifaceted concept, but the concept evolved from a purely scientific discipline to encompass agricultural practices and social movements. The historical development of agroecology, particularly in countries such as the United States of America (USA), Brazil, Germany, and France, highlight its diverse interpretations where certain countries recognise agroecology as a scientific field and others emphasise the practical applications and social implications of agroecology (Thomas and Kevan, 1993). Nevertheless, agroecology may be seen as a science, set of practices, and social movement, that offers a transformative approach to food systems (Wezel et al., 2020).
Agrifood systems are complex and interconnected and have the ability to influence various aspects of our lives. To understand and improve these systems, it is, therefore, crucial to measure and assess their performance. However, the diversity of agrifood systems and the multitude of assessment objectives make it challenging to develop a single, universally applicable agroecological assessment framework (Lamanna et al., 2024). According to Geck et al. (2023), traditional agroecological performance metrics often focus on productivity and profitability, neglecting other crucial aspects such as environmental and social impacts
To address challenges related to measuring the performance of food systems, Lamanna et al. (2024) proposed a meta-framework to guide the development of holistic agrifood system assessments. This meta-framework outlines a step-by-step process for designing assessments that are tailored to specific needs and objectives and provides principles to assist in selecting appropriate metrics and methodologies, ensuring that the assessments are comprehensive, relevant, and actionable. Lamanna et al. (2024) states that by following this framework, researchers,
9
policymakers, and practitioners can develop effective assessments that contribute to the sustainability and resilience of agrifood systems.
Geck et al. (2023) emphasised the importance of developing agroecology assessment approaches that are both globally comparable and locally relevant. The Holistic Localised Performance Assessment (HOLPA) tool is a comprehensive framework for assessing the multidimensional performance of agroecological systems at the household, field, farm, and landscape levels (Jones et al., 2024). The aim of HOLPA assessments is to capture a wide range of indicators, including economic, environmental, and social factors, and the HOLPA tool has been designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, allowing for local customisation while maintaining global comparability. By incorporating a localisation process, HOLPA ensures that assessments are relevant to local needs and priorities. This approach enables a more nuanced understanding of agroecological practices and their impact on sustainable development (Jones et al., 2024).
2.2 The Principles of Agroecology
Agroecology is a multifaceted concept that encompasses ecological, social, and economic dimensions (van Dien and Fuchs, 2023). The key aim of agroecology is to create sustainable and equitable food systems by fostering harmonious relationships between people, nature, and animals. The 13 principles of agroecology, outlined by the High-Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE), provide a framework for guiding agroecological practices (HLPE, 2019). These principles emphasise resource efficiency, resilience, and social justice by promoting practices such as recycling, biodiversity conservation, and fair governance (HLPE, 2019).
Agroecology emphasises sustainable practices such as recycling, reducing inputs, and prioritising soil and animal health. When these practices are applied correctly, they can also foster biodiversity gains, synergy, and economic diversification. Therefore, agroecology promotes resilient and equitable food systems and the co-creation of knowledge, social values, and fair governance. The HLPE principles of agroecology are also aligned with the 10 elements of agroecology identified by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and provide pathways for incremental and transformative change towards sustainable agriculture and food systems (Wezel et al., 2020).
Agroecology is a holistic approach to agriculture that integrates ecological principles with the social and economic facets of agriculture. The core tenets of agroecology encompass the promotion of socially equitable and resilient food systems, as well as the optimisation and strengthening of resource use for agricultural purposes (HLPE, 2019). The 13 principles of agroecology provide a framework for transitioning towards sustainable, fair, and equitable agricultural practices (HLPE, 2019). However, to operationalise the agroecological principles a combination of scientific methodologies and participatory approaches are required. This will involve a multidisciplinary approach, drawing upon experience in ecology, agriculture, engineering, soil science, agronomy, economics, and sociology.
The HOLPA tool has been designed to evaluate how a farm performs according to the environmental, social, economic, and political dimensions of agroecology (Jones et al., 2024). To ensure its adaptability and relevance, HOLPA includes both globally applicable and locally specific metrices for evidence-based decision"

CGIAR is a global research partnership for a food-secure future dedicated to transforming food, land, and water systems into a climate crisis.
Outcome
Use of the vaccine
The CGIAR Initiative on Sustainable Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender Inclusion (SAPLING) has supported the production of 120,000 doses of peste des petits ruminants thermotolerant vaccine. Using the innovation platforms approach, vaccination has reached so far 50,000 number of sheep and goats across in Segou, Sikasso and Koutiala region. All animals have been identified to avoid repeated vaccinations in the coming years, which is a waste of vaccines.
Investment
In addition, the innovation has attracted donor investment (African development Bank through the Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation program) of an amount of USD580,000 over 3 years (2024-2026) to produce and deploy 1,000,000 vaccines doses to reach out to the same number of sheep and goats across 35,000 households in SAPLING sites (Sikasso, Koutiala and Segou).
Policy engagement
The government and relevant national and regional stakeholders have engaged in developing a strategy to scale the vaccine in the country and beyond. Several policy meetings have been organized so far. In addition, market authorization request for regional use has been submitted to the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU).
Partners
o Laboratoire Central Vétérinaire (LCV): in charge of the vaccine production
o Direction nationale des Services Vétérinaires (DNSV): in charge of the vaccine regulation and vaccination strategy.
o Collectif des Vétérinaires Mandataires (COVEM): in charge of vaccine dissemination to farmers
Why did we do this research?
Peste des petits ruminants represents the most significant threat to small ruminants owned by farmers. Hence the importance of eradicating, or at least heavily reducing, the disease through vaccination. A live attenuated vaccine to protect sheep and goats against peste des petits ruminants has been commercially available for several decades. A single dose remains effective for at least three years, which is the average lifespan of a small ruminant. The vaccine, sold under brand names such as “Ovipeste” in Mali, is based on the Nigeria 75/1 strain of the disease. It has been used without any adverse effects and provides protection against all lineages of peste des petits ruminants virus. It is manufactured in several countries under different commercial names, and it is relatively cheap. However, it has one major disadvantage: it requires cold storage until used on the animal. This means that it cannot be used by veterinarians working in remote areas without electricity or cold storage facilities. This is one of the main reasons why vaccination coverage in Mali for small ruminants is very sub-optimal, despite heavy investment in the country’s public veterinary services and annual vaccination campaigns. ILRI and its partners have developed a thermotolerant vaccine for peste des petits ruminants; in other words, a vaccine which doesn’t require a cold chain for a certain number of days. The new thermotolerant vaccine provides Mali and other
countries in the Sahel with a tremendous opportunity. Provided there is the political will to take advantage of the vaccine, and the organizational and financial support for its deployment, peste des petits ruminants could be eradicated by the end of the decade. This would lead to a dramatic improvement in income and welfare for millions of people, especially women and children.
Evidence
A national policy engagement was supported by SAPLING project policy engagement; in addition the vaccine attracted investment for the next three years (2024-2026). Furthermore, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through One CGIAR Initiative is supporting a scaling strategy, that CGIAR can integrate into its diverse innovation ecosystem, ensuring the design, implementation, and monitoring of practical, accountable, and impactful scaling strategies. The approach is to have a scale-up design process aligned with the CGIAR Innovation Package and the Scale-Up Readiness Approach (IPSR). The process will be a co-creation and test with ongoing scaling efforts. The goal is not to reinvent the wheel, but to have guidelines that can serve a wide range of CGIAR innovations and innovation packages.
Next steps  
The vaccine is being registered for regional market authorization in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) countries. In addition, the innovation (the vaccine) together with their associated innovation packages (delivery systems) are being subject to the CGIAR Innovation Package and Scaling Readiness (IPSR) approach. The goal is to ultimately have long-term delivery strategy in Mali, with a detailed, costed implementation plan for the next six years. A regional policy stakeholder meeting is planned to create buy in by the governments and investors. Opportunities for scaling the vaccine in the region is also considered.

DO@@66 64 sretereee® -@@@60206026 264
This booklet is to keep records related to your artificial insemination (AI) enterprise for accounting purposes. Records are kept and all AI related revenues and costs, and profit (or loss) is calculated.
Revenue = money earned from selling products or providing services.
Examples include fees received for synchronization, AI service provision, pregnancy detection, breeding advice, reproductive tract treatment.
Arm
Costs = expenses incurred to produce or sell the products or services Examples include payments for semen, hormone, drug, liquid nitrogen, AI equipment, transport.
Profit = Revenue – Costs (a negative value indicates a loss)
—— —w
Monthly accounting = Fill one row of the table for each revenue or cost item. At the end of the month calculate the monthly totals for revenue and costs, as well as profit. Start a new sheet for recording the next months information.
Cumulative accounting = Use the sheets at the back of the back to determine cumulative revenue, costs and profit (where cumulative means summed over all months).

1. Introduction
Agroecology contributes to the sustainable transformation of agri-food systems going beyond a narrow focus on productivity (Bilali et al., 2019) in order to address key challenges related to food security and climate change (Altieri and Nicholls, 2017). It seeks to balance and increase the interactions within the agroecosystems to address the food crisis and increase the potential for sustainable agriculture while accounting for social aspects that promote a fair and just food system (FAO, 2023). As a system-based approach, agroecology taps into local knowledge and contextualized resources and focuses not only on the farm level but also on production, markets, and consumption, all of which enhance or hinder transitions (Kansanga et al., 2023). There are 13 principles (Table 1) that guide and define agroecology, and they relate to improving resource efficiency, strengthen resilience, and secure social equity/responsibility (Wezel et al., 2021; Snapp, 2017; HLPE 2019).

change drivers in agroecological transition pathways is integral to triggering the paradigm shift from conventional farming (Alary et al., 2023; FAO, 2023).
In 2022, the CGIAR launched the Transformational Agroecology Across the Food, Land, and Water Systems initiative (AE-I) in eight countries. The initiative is guided by the 13 agroecological principles and anchored on the concept of living landscapes that promotes multi-stakeholder engagement in understanding and influencing agroecological transformations. In Kenya, the two selected Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALLs) in Kenya are Makueni and Kiambu Counties (Nyawira et al., 2023; Guettou Djurfeldt et al., 2023). This qualitative study is part of work package five (WP5) of the initiative that focuses on agency and behavioral change among agri-food system actors. The study was anchored on the following objectives.
a) Co-develop a timeline of key events that affected the Agroecology Living Landscape (ALL) country’s agroecological transformation, focusing on the same scale of change as the vision-to-action exercise (maybe at multiple scales).
b) Identify whether and how the key events affected the agency, behavior change, and representation/inclusion/participation of diverse actors in the agri-food system and check for any explicit gender differences.
1.1. Methods
This study used a qualitative approach to gather data in Kiambu and Makueni Counties during September and October 2023. Data was gathered through focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) focusing on actors’ experiences, agency, behavior change, and responses to agroecological opportunities during key past events that affected local agroecological transition pathways.
1.1.1. Sample
The study purposively sampled 8 communities from Kiambu and Makueni counties (Table 2). The two counties are areas where the agroecology initiative is implementing its activities.

A total of 202 participants (95 men and 107 women) were purposively selected to participate in both FGDs and KIIs (Tables 3 and 4). A total of 16 FGDs having a total of 172 participants (84 men and 88 women) and 30 KIIs (11 men and 19 women) were

conducted. Furthermore, out of the total sample of 202 participants, 42 were youth (young women and young men aged 35 or below) and they were purposely sampled to participate in the FGDs and KII. In each ward, 2 FGDs, one with men and another with women, were carried out. The number of participants per FGD ranged between 7 and 12 across all the study sites.
The study implemented a minimum of three (3) key informant interviews per study community. Guided by information need and saturation, participants in the FGDs and KIIs were drawn from a broader spectrum of actors in the agricultural value chains in the ALLs, based on their availability and convenience. Another consideration in the selection of the key informants was based on the need to cover broader constituent actors who influence agri-food value chains in the ALLs. Some actors identified themselves as playing multiple roles along the value chain (Table 5).

Data processing and analysis
Preliminary analysis started during data collection where emerging themes and key events in the agroecological transitions were identified daily during review. FGDs and KIIs were recorded and transcribed, open coding was implemented through the reading

5
of the transcripts with connotations to reinforce previously identified themes. The different timelines of agroecological transitions generated from the data were consolidated to represent each community visited, with disaggregation by gender.
The key events in the consolidated timelines were attributed to a specific year and coded into categories of events e.g. capacity building, climate change, market demand, cost of inputs, policy change and health concerns. The analysis explored how the events affected different actors, the different practices adopted, and the actors’ roles in decision-making and agency. When analysing the data actors were grouped based on their self-identified roles in the agricultural value chain. Participant responses in FGDs and KIIs were analysed both holistically and disaggregated by sex and by youth or non-youth. In the results section, young women and young men are referred to as youth when referring to both sexes.
In December 2024, two validation workshops were conducted (one in Makueni and one in Kiambu). Study participants were invited and 54 participants attended (15 women and 10 men in Makueni, 17 women and 12 men in Kiambu). The project team presented the results from the study and the participants were given the opportunity to verify or refine the interpretation of the data and the results as well as discuss key recommendations and actions that should be implemented in current and future initiatives, and main messages for policy makers, researchers, and other programme and initiative designers.

2. Results
Agroecological transitions are dynamic and continuous. In this study, the respondents were asked to reflect on when the transition started and what events triggered the start. Different actors along the value chains experienced the start of the transition at different times, which emphasizes that the transitions are dynamic and individual. A common stance among the participants is that agroecological practices have been part of farming practices dating back to the 1950s and 1960s. In its traditional form, agroecology was primarily enacted as natural and sustainable production practices. According to an FGD with men “the agroecological practices that we are talking about are not new because they have been used in past by our parents on their farms” (Men FGD, Mangu - Kiambu).
Actors in the two counties noted that the shifts in use of traditional agroecological practices came about with the introduction of chemical inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides in the 1980s. During this time many producers abandoned or reduced the use of their traditional practices including agroecological ones in the form of organic agriculture. One farmer and input supplier in Kiambu explained that “when pesticides were introduced and touted as efficient means of pest control, farmers stopped using those old methods such as wood ash” (Women FGD, Lari - Kiambu). The shift in application of traditional agroecological practices was largely driven by government institutions and non-profit organizations with food production systems becoming more industrialized in addition to widespread fertilizer application for production facilitated by government policy.
Discussions with key informants revealed that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are currently the leading actors of projects and initiatives that push for the transformation of food systems through the adoption of agroecology in the ALLs. One key informant contends that “we have international organizations working with local organizations to drive change in the way we do our farming […] systems such regenerative agriculture and agroecology are being promoted greatly” (Woman KII, Makueni). In Kiambu County, in particular, actors highlighted that there is sustained promotion of agroecology in the form of organic and climate-smart agriculture with the promoted practices going beyond production to include processing and consumption.
2.1. Start of the transitions
The study detailed when actors began adopting agroecological practices, revealing individualized transitions rather than collective efforts. As one participant noted: “What I know is that I started using some practices in my farm that are agroecological as an individual, we never started as a group or community” (Women FGD, Wote – Makueni). For actors involved in food production, the application of some agroecological practices within a locality “may give the notion of community or collective actions but yet it mostly individuals who decide to start using such practices but in different times” (Woman KII Organic Farmer, Githunguri - Kiambu).
The discussion on the starting points focused on farm-level production and hence, the transition was attributed to shifts in farm- level practices more than systems level shifts that could include other aspects of agroecology. Some actors experienced ambiguity or fluctuation rather than a clear start to their agroecological transition. For instance, one farmer + input supplier in Makueni noted that “looking back I may not tell exactly when I started because I have been using farm manure in some years and others, I use chemical fertilizer” (Women FGD, Ndeiya – Kiambu). This stresses the importance of understanding the transition pathways as dynamic rather than linear and causal.
The starting points presented varied across the study locations. In Makueni County, farmers in Kisau Kiteta and Ukia wards reported an earlier shift towards agroecology compared to the other wards. This could potentially be explained by their location in the middle and upper ecological zones, which experience moderate to high rainfall conducive to mixed farming and agroforestry. Similarly, in Kiambu, Mangu and Githunguri Wards farmers started the transition earlier than the rest of the wards. This can be explained in part due to their conducive ecological conditions, availability of resources for manure production and earlier exposure to agroecological-related programs.
Study results show that generally, women actors in Makueni began the application of the agroecological practices earliest (2007) followed by men in 2010. While in Kiambu men were the ones that started the earliest as they reported on events from 2000 and women did not start the transition until 2013.. While women in Makueni seem to have started using agroecological practices earlier than men, there are confounding factors that limit their agency since “adoption of such practices is dependent on the man's approval for use”(Woman FGD, Ukia - Makueni).Despite having limited agency for implementation, women tend to have

more knowledge of agroecological practices compared to men primarily because of their high representation in agroecology knowledge dissemination platforms and as one KII explained “Many participants in trainings are women [...] and they the same people doing most of the farm work” (Woman KII, Government – Kiambu). Therefore, it can be observed that farm-level implementation of AE practices appear to be dominated by women, which is also an indication of the division of labor in production where women carry out most of the agricultural production work. Women participated in capacity-building activities for agroecology more often than men and youth (both young women and young men).
2.1.1. Key events that triggered the agroecological transition
In developing the timelines, the actors discussed the major events that triggered the agroecological transition. The study recorded a total of 71 key events, 35 in Kiambu and 36 in Makueni that were later grouped into six categories: capacity building, climate change, health concerns, cost of inputs, market demand, and policy change (Figure 1). These categories are what we call the drivers for change and what has contributed to actor transitions from conventional agricultural farming practices to agroecological practices (in participants’ words, “traditional agricultural practices”). In Kiambu County, actors identified events across all six categories while actors in Makueni identified events in only three categories: climate change, capacity building and health concerns. Figure 2 and figure 3 show the key event categories disaggregated by gender where capacity building is the leading key event for both followed by climate change for men and health concerns for women. Timelines were consolidated by ward and displayed the timing and categories of the key events reported by men and women (Figure 4). More detailed illustrations per county can be found in annex 1 and annex 2.

2.1.1.1 Capacity building
Capacity building in the form of information campaigns and training was the leading driver for change in Makueni County, accounting for 90% of the events reported in Makueni timelines. In Kiambu, capacity building accounted for 54% of the events while health concerns and cost of inputs accounted for 14% each. Training initiatives led by NGOs, government agencies, and community organizations focused initially on production practices, particularly organic fertilization, agroforestry, and integrated pest management. A key informant in Kiambu explained that “the focus on other aspects of the value chain such as processing is something that has come in later when farmers had started using simple forms of agroecology practices” (Woman KII, Farmer + Processor, Kiambu). Among the reported timeline events, capacity-building interventions covering processing, marketing and consumption have been implemented in later years (from 2018 onwards). Soil health and sustainable land management were more prominently featured in reported capacity-building sessions in Makueni than in Kiambu. Participants in both counties appreciated the holistic approach of the trainings.
The dominance of capacity building as a driver of behavior change in the transition to agroecology is in line with the findings of the study on agency and change from 2023 that showed that trainings what the leading entry point for behavioral change applied by organizations such as NGOs (Guettou Djurfeldt et.al. 2023). However, women and men in Kiambu and Makueni pointed out different aspects of training as a trigger or motivation for change. Women in Kiambu highlighted the value of practical training sessions that included local resource use suitable for small land sizes, farm demonstrations, and follow-up as key motivators to start the shift from conventional agriculture. In contrast, men valued training sessions for their emphasis on economic benefits through increase in yield or reduced input costs in addition to field visits and support from extension workers. However, both men and women groups in Kiambu highlighted actors' incentivization with inputs such as seeds/seedlings and available market linkages for agroecological production (mostly in the form of organic) as other drivers, linked to the training sessions, that triggered their transition to agroecology.
Men in Makueni particularly stressed the coverage of both production and post-harvest handling as well as demonstrating the economic viability of agroecological practices played an important role in the decision to transition. One participant from an FGD in Makueni said “I liked how the Cereal Growers Association provided demonstrations of these practices, gave us some seeds and we had village officers who followed up on our progress and supported us” (Men FGD, Wote –- Makueni). Women appreciated that the trainings included field support and demonstrations as well as incentives such as farm inputs.
2.1.1.2 Health Concerns
In both Kiambu and Makueni, awareness of the health risks associated with synthetic inputs drove actors toward agroecology. Women in particular expressed concern for family members’ health and food safety, associating agroecological methods with safer production. One man from a group discussion in Makueni added that “the heavy use of synthetic inputs have been associated with widespread lifestyle disease that we know are leading causes of death now….so as farmers and retailers we had to do something and that’s why we started planting safe vegetables as a group” (Men FGD, Kisau-Kiteta – Makueni). One FGD with a women's group in Kiambu puts the situation into perspective. “there are many health challenges that we associate with food produced using agro-chemicals, so it was clear that we wanted an alternative that’s why we started applying these agroecological practices” (Women FGD, Mangu –- Kiambu).
2.1.1.3 Climate Change
The impact of climate events, notably droughts and unpredictable rainfall patterns, motivated shifts to climate-resilient farming practices. The widespread drought of 2020 leading to low productivity or no production at all pushed farmers into alternative practices, as expressed by one farmer: “we experienced a long period of extended drought in the year 2020 unlike before. From the losses we encountered when knew we had to try other methods like drip irrigation for us to survive"" (Women FGD, Githunguri – Kiambu). In Makueni, one man in an FGD noted that “ It [the change] was essential because we could no longer predict when the rain would come, and one must look for food. So, one must look for other ways to harvest” (Men FGD, Ukia, Makueni). Discussions with key informants in the two counties affirmed the results from the FGD that events like prolonged droughts have driven actors to embrace change from conventional farming methods. According to a male key informant in Makueni, “the challenges of drought have driven the farmers in this area to start taking up climate-resilient practices” suggesting that producers were pushed to adapt their agricultural practices.

2.1.1.4 Cost of Inputs
Rising input costs, especially for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, were a significant motivator in Kiambu, specifically in Ndeiya, Lari and Githunguri. Discussions with key informants also confirmed that “the input prices were so high that farmers were not able to afford them. So, they dropped out of farming but later realized they could use their local resources like manure to continue with farming” (Man KII, Input Supplier, Makueni). In a women's FGD in Githunguri they said that “the prices of livestock feed were high at the time so we started working out ways of using farm materials to make feed for our livestock for us to sustain them and from there, we have never gone back to inorganic feeds” (Women FGD, Githunguri – Kaimbu). Reinforcing this view, discussions with men confirms that the cost of synthetic farm inputs “were too high compared to the profit hence making producers and retailers change their practices and start using locally available resources” (FGD Men, Lari - Kiambu). These high costs of inputs and feeds for the animals were noted to affect women more due to their limited decision-making power over the use of income on input acquisition. Having control over income and resources of production, men have a higher agency in accessing low-cost sustainable practices compared to women. With the prohibitive costs of inputs, men view the transition to alternative cost-effective solutions to sustain production as a necessity to maintain or increase the profit. Women on the other had to consider the transition as a way to sustain their production within their household decision- making constraints and as a potential solution for cheap and cost-effective food production.
2.1.1.5 Emerging Markets
Emerging local and international market opportunities for agroecological products also drive the agroecological transition in Kiambu County. Farmers, farmers + retailers and farmer + wholesalers equipped with knowledge about agroecological product markets gained higher price premiums from these markets in Nairobi and its environs. “There is a growing market for organic products where the prices are even better” (Man KII, Government, Kiambu). Men and women food suppliers (farmer + retailers and farmer + wholesalers) acknowledged that awareness among local consumers on the benefits of safe food and the risks of pesticide and heavy chemical residues has driven the demand for agroecological products as exemplified in the following voice. “Consumers are keen to know the safety of the foods they buy such as vegetables and many are increasingly demanding organic products only” (Women FGD, Ndeiya, Kiambu). Thus, consumer demand for safe food products continues to be a good driver for local agroecology produce markets while at the same time providing actors in the value chain better prices.
2.1.2. Policy changes
Although only mentioned in one focus group, the policy change that led to decentralizing the government system was reported as having a profound impact on farming practices as it brought agricultural officers and support services closer to local communities. One respondent from a men’s FGD in Mangu, Kiambu “ We started changing from conventional agriculture when we got a devolved system of government. That is when we started diving into agriculture, and the teachings on agriculture began. I believe we started doing those changes ten years ago. Some people were sent to teach us. I do not know what they were called, but I know those groups that came to teach us were from the Ministry of Agriculture”. With devolution, farmers gained easier access to expert guidance, leading to more frequent interactions with agricultural officers. This closer proximity allowed farmers to learn about soil health, irrigation methods, pest control, and other sustainable agricultural practices, resulting in a gradual shift from conventional to more efficient and environmentally friendly farming.

2.2. Drivers and enablers of agroecological transitions
The adoption of agroecological practices is influenced by various enablers that encourage behavior change. These enablers span individual, community, institutional, and environmental dimensions, impacting actors’ ability to adopt and sustain agroecological practices, which in turn is also influenced by their agency. These enablers impact diverse actors differently by gender and other aspects.

2.2.1. Individual dimension
2.2.1.1 Knowledge
Field demonstrations and peer-learning: Capacity building emerged as a critical enabler, fostering knowledge and self-efficacy among actors. Men tended to value the technical skills they obtained that allowed them to improve farm productivity and income as brought out in one FGD with men in Kiambu “The different training from many organizations has enabled us to maximize and expand our production” (Men FGD, Mangu – Kiambu). Conversely, women emphasized the value of their gains in agency and decision-making and sustainability in production. “The training has made us know how to store our seeds, make and source for organic inputs and use practices that suits our small sizes of land” (Women FGD, Ndeiya – Kiambu). Training sessions, peer learning, and hands-on demonstrations were instrumental in building confidence, especially for women producers who often preferred practical, field-based training. For many actors increased knowledge enabled more informed decision- making and greater agency in adopting new practices. A woman from Makueni shared, “learning from other farmers on how they are doing their farming has been a key factor in adopting the agroecological practices” (Women FGD, Kisau-Kiteta – Makueni).
Food safety consciousness: The study results show men, women, and youth farmers are conscious of the safety of the food they consume pushing farmers and consumers to seek safer alternatives. However, women appear to be more concerned than all the groups as exemplified in the following woman farmer’s voice: “We are now reverting to consuming those traditional foods because, firstly, we understand they are healthier […] We have people who engage in farming without using fertilizers,

and their maize, when processed into flour, has a unique quality. This has motivated me to explore organic farming to avoid health crises” (FGD Women, Kisau-Kiteta - Makueni). Most women in Kiambu were more likely to report an inclination towards the consum.

Call to Action
Broaden Youth Engagement: 
Actively involve and support youth in all aspects of the agroecological value chain, particularly in roles that extend beyond traditional producer roles. Offer support that extends to land access constraints and other challenges faced by youth that have led to youth moving away from agriculture. 
Create Motivating Incentives for Sustainable Practices:
Work with private sector, cooperatives, and financial services, and government institutions to develop and implement incentive structures that offer tangible benefits like market access and certification advantages. These incentives can encourage farmers’ sustained practice of agroecology.
Foster Gender Equity in agroecological interventions: 
Actively involve men and women from the same household in every aspect of agroecological efforts, encourage shared responsibilities and benefits as well as tackle restrictive gender norms. This strategy could mitigate intra-household conflicts and promote equitable and effective agroecological transition.

1. Introduction
Agroecology contributes to the sustainable transformation of agri-food systems going beyond a narrow focus on productivity (Bilali et al., 2019) in order to address key challenges related to food security and climate change (Altieri and Nicholls, 2017). It seeks to balance and increase the interactions within the agroecosystems to address the food crisis and increase the potential for sustainable agriculture while accounting for social aspects that promote a fair and just food system (FAO, 2023). As a system-based approach, agroecology taps into local knowledge and contextualized resources and focuses not only on the farm level but also on production, markets, and consumption, all of which enhance or hinder transitions (Kansanga et al., 2023). There are 13 principles (Table 1) that guide and define agroecology, and they relate to improving resource efficiency, strengthen resilience, and secure social equity/responsibility (Wezel et al., 2021; Snapp, 2017; HLPE 2019).

change drivers in agroecological transition pathways is integral to triggering the paradigm shift from conventional farming (Alary et al., 2023; FAO, 2023).
In 2022, the CGIAR launched the Transformational Agroecology Across the Food, Land, and Water Systems initiative (AE-I) in eight countries. The initiative is guided by the 13 agroecological principles and anchored on the concept of living landscapes that promotes multi-stakeholder engagement in understanding and influencing agroecological transformations. In Kenya, the two selected Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALLs) in Kenya are Makueni and Kiambu Counties (Nyawira et al., 2023; Guettou Djurfeldt et al., 2023). This qualitative study is part of work package five (WP5) of the initiative that focuses on agency and behavioral change among agri-food system actors. The study was anchored on the following objectives.
a) Co-develop a timeline of key events that affected the Agroecology Living Landscape (ALL) country’s agroecological transformation, focusing on the same scale of change as the vision-to-action exercise (maybe at multiple scales).
b) Identify whether and how the key events affected the agency, behavior change, and representation/inclusion/participation of diverse actors in the agri-food system and check for any explicit gender differences.
1.1. Methods
This study used a qualitative approach to gather data in Kiambu and Makueni Counties during September and October 2023. Data was gathered through focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) focusing on actors’ experiences, agency, behavior change, and responses to agroecological opportunities during key past events that affected local agroecological transition pathways.
1.1.1. Sample
The study purposively sampled 8 communities from Kiambu and Makueni counties (Table 2). The two counties are areas where the agroecology initiative is implementing its activities.

A total of 202 participants (95 men and 107 women) were purposively selected to participate in both FGDs and KIIs (Tables 3 and 4). A total of 16 FGDs having a total of 172 participants (84 men and 88 women) and 30 KIIs (11 men and 19 women) were

conducted. Furthermore, out of the total sample of 202 participants, 42 were youth (young women and young men aged 35 or below) and they were purposely sampled to participate in the FGDs and KII. In each ward, 2 FGDs, one with men and another with women, were carried out. The number of participants per FGD ranged between 7 and 12 across all the study sites.
The study implemented a minimum of three (3) key informant interviews per study community. Guided by information need and saturation, participants in the FGDs and KIIs were drawn from a broader spectrum of actors in the agricultural value chains in the ALLs, based on their availability and convenience. Another consideration in the selection of the key informants was based on the need to cover broader constituent actors who influence agri-food value chains in the ALLs. Some actors identified themselves as playing multiple roles along the value chain (Table 5).

Data processing and analysis
Preliminary analysis started during data collection where emerging themes and key events in the agroecological transitions were identified daily during review. FGDs and KIIs were recorded and transcribed, open coding was implemented through the reading

5
of the transcripts with connotations to reinforce previously identified themes. The different timelines of agroecological transitions generated from the data were consolidated to represent each community visited, with disaggregation by gender.
The key events in the consolidated timelines were attributed to a specific year and coded into categories of events e.g. capacity building, climate change, market demand, cost of inputs, policy change and health concerns. The analysis explored how the events affected different actors, the different practices adopted, and the actors’ roles in decision-making and agency. When analysing the data actors were grouped based on their self-identified roles in the agricultural value chain. Participant responses in FGDs and KIIs were analysed both holistically and disaggregated by sex and by youth or non-youth. In the results section, young women and young men are referred to as youth when referring to both sexes.
In December 2024, two validation workshops were conducted (one in Makueni and one in Kiambu). Study participants were invited and 54 participants attended (15 women and 10 men in Makueni, 17 women and 12 men in Kiambu). The project team presented the results from the study and the participants were given the opportunity to verify or refine the interpretation of the data and the results as well as discuss key recommendations and actions that should be implemented in current and future initiatives, and main messages for policy makers, researchers, and other programme and initiative designers.

2. Results
Agroecological transitions are dynamic and continuous. In this study, the respondents were asked to reflect on when the transition started and what events triggered the start. Different actors along the value chains experienced the start of the transition at different times, which emphasizes that the transitions are dynamic and individual. A common stance among the participants is that agroecological practices have been part of farming practices dating back to the 1950s and 1960s. In its traditional form, agroecology was primarily enacted as natural and sustainable production practices. According to an FGD with men “the agroecological practices that we are talking about are not new because they have been used in past by our parents on their farms” (Men FGD, Mangu - Kiambu).
Actors in the two counties noted that the shifts in use of traditional agroecological practices came about with the introduction of chemical inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides in the 1980s. During this time many producers abandoned or reduced the use of their traditional practices including agroecological ones in the form of organic agriculture. One farmer and input supplier in Kiambu explained that “when pesticides were introduced and touted as efficient means of pest control, farmers stopped using those old methods such as wood ash” (Women FGD, Lari - Kiambu). The shift in application of traditional agroecological practices was largely driven by government institutions and non-profit organizations with food production systems becoming more industrialized in addition to widespread fertilizer application for production facilitated by government policy.
Discussions with key informants revealed that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are currently the leading actors of projects and initiatives that push for the transformation of food systems through the adoption of agroecology in the ALLs. One key informant contends that “we have international organizations working with local organizations to drive change in the way we do our farming […] systems such regenerative agriculture and agroecology are being promoted greatly” (Woman KII, Makueni). In Kiambu County, in particular, actors highlighted that there is sustained promotion of agroecology in the form of organic and climate-smart agriculture with the promoted practices going beyond production to include processing and consumption.
2.1. Start of the transitions
The study detailed when actors began adopting agroecological practices, revealing individualized transitions rather than collective efforts. As one participant noted: “What I know is that I started using some practices in my farm that are agroecological as an individual, we never started as a group or community” (Women FGD, Wote – Makueni). For actors involved in food production, the application of some agroecological practices within a locality “may give the notion of community or collective actions but yet it mostly individuals who decide to start using such practices but in different times” (Woman KII Organic Farmer, Githunguri - Kiambu).
The discussion on the starting points focused on farm-level production and hence, the transition was attributed to shifts in farm- level practices more than systems level shifts that could include other aspects of agroecology. Some actors experienced ambiguity or fluctuation rather than a clear start to their agroecological transition. For instance, one farmer + input supplier in Makueni noted that “looking back I may not tell exactly when I started because I have been using farm manure in some years and others, I use chemical fertilizer” (Women FGD, Ndeiya – Kiambu). This stresses the importance of understanding the transition pathways as dynamic rather than linear and causal.
The starting points presented varied across the study locations. In Makueni County, farmers in Kisau Kiteta and Ukia wards reported an earlier shift towards agroecology compared to the other wards. This could potentially be explained by their location in the middle and upper ecological zones, which experience moderate to high rainfall conducive to mixed farming and agroforestry. Similarly, in Kiambu, Mangu and Githunguri Wards farmers started the transition earlier than the rest of the wards. This can be explained in part due to their conducive ecological conditions, availability of resources for manure production and earlier exposure to agroecological-related programs.
Study results show that generally, women actors in Makueni began the application of the agroecological practices earliest (2007) followed by men in 2010. While in Kiambu men were the ones that started the earliest as they reported on events from 2000 and women did not start the transition until 2013.. While women in Makueni seem to have started using agroecological practices earlier than men, there are confounding factors that limit their agency since “adoption of such practices is dependent on the man's approval for use”(Woman FGD, Ukia - Makueni).Despite having limited agency for implementation, women tend to have

more knowledge of agroecological practices compared to men primarily because of their high representation in agroecology knowledge dissemination platforms and as one KII explained “Many participants in trainings are women [...] and they the same people doing most of the farm work” (Woman KII, Government – Kiambu). Therefore, it can be observed that farm-level implementation of AE practices appear to be dominated by women, which is also an indication of the division of labor in production where women carry out most of the agricultural production work. Women participated in capacity-building activities for agroecology more often than men and youth (both young women and young men).
2.1.1. Key events that triggered the agroecological transition
In developing the timelines, the actors discussed the major events that triggered the agroecological transition. The study recorded a total of 71 key events, 35 in Kiambu and 36 in Makueni that were later grouped into six categories: capacity building, climate change, health concerns, cost of inputs, market demand, and policy change (Figure 1). These categories are what we call the drivers for change and what has contributed to actor transitions from conventional agricultural farming practices to agroecological practices (in participants’ words, “traditional agricultural practices”). In Kiambu County, actors identified events across all six categories while actors in Makueni identified events in only three categories: climate change, capacity building and health concerns. Figure 2 and figure 3 show the key event categories disaggregated by gender where capacity building is the leading key event for both followed by climate change for men and health concerns for women. Timelines were consolidated by ward and displayed the timing and categories of the key events reported by men and women (Figure 4). More detailed illustrations per county can be found in annex 1 and annex 2.

2.1.1.1 Capacity building
Capacity building in the form of information campaigns and training was the leading driver for change in Makueni County, accounting for 90% of the events reported in Makueni timelines. In Kiambu, capacity building accounted for 54% of the events while health concerns and cost of inputs accounted for 14% each. Training initiatives led by NGOs, government agencies, and community organizations focused initially on production practices, particularly organic fertilization, agroforestry, and integrated pest management. A key informant in Kiambu explained that “the focus on other aspects of the value chain such as processing is something that has come in later when farmers had started using simple forms of agroecology practices” (Woman KII, Farmer + Processor, Kiambu). Among the reported timeline events, capacity-building interventions covering processing, marketing and consumption have been implemented in later years (from 2018 onwards). Soil health and sustainable land management were more prominently featured in reported capacity-building sessions in Makueni than in Kiambu. Participants in both counties appreciated the holistic approach of the trainings.
The dominance of capacity building as a driver of behavior change in the transition to agroecology is in line with the findings of the study on agency and change from 2023 that showed that trainings what the leading entry point for behavioral change applied by organizations such as NGOs (Guettou Djurfeldt et.al. 2023). However, women and men in Kiambu and Makueni pointed out different aspects of training as a trigger or motivation for change. Women in Kiambu highlighted the value of practical training sessions that included local resource use suitable for small land sizes, farm demonstrations, and follow-up as key motivators to start the shift from conventional agriculture. In contrast, men valued training sessions for their emphasis on economic benefits through increase in yield or reduced input costs in addition to field visits and support from extension workers. However, both men and women groups in Kiambu highlighted actors' incentivization with inputs such as seeds/seedlings and available market linkages for agroecological production (mostly in the form of organic) as other drivers, linked to the training sessions, that triggered their transition to agroecology.
Men in Makueni particularly stressed the coverage of both production and post-harvest handling as well as demonstrating the economic viability of agroecological practices played an important role in the decision to transition. One participant from an FGD in Makueni said “I liked how the Cereal Growers Association provided demonstrations of these practices, gave us some seeds and we had village officers who followed up on our progress and supported us” (Men FGD, Wote –- Makueni). Women appreciated that the trainings included field support and demonstrations as well as incentives such as farm inputs.
2.1.1.2 Health Concerns
In both Kiambu and Makueni, awareness of the health risks associated with synthetic inputs drove actors toward agroecology. Women in particular expressed concern for family members’ health and food safety, associating agroecological methods with safer production. One man from a group discussion in Makueni added that “the heavy use of synthetic inputs have been associated with widespread lifestyle disease that we know are leading causes of death now….so as farmers and retailers we had to do something and that’s why we started planting safe vegetables as a group” (Men FGD, Kisau-Kiteta – Makueni). One FGD with a women's group in Kiambu puts the situation into perspective. “there are many health challenges that we associate with food produced using agro-chemicals, so it was clear that we wanted an alternative that’s why we started applying these agroecological practices” (Women FGD, Mangu –- Kiambu).
2.1.1.3 Climate Change
The impact of climate events, notably droughts and unpredictable rainfall patterns, motivated shifts to climate-resilient farming practices. The widespread drought of 2020 leading to low productivity or no production at all pushed farmers into alternative practices, as expressed by one farmer: “we experienced a long period of extended drought in the year 2020 unlike before. From the losses we encountered when knew we had to try other methods like drip irrigation for us to survive"" (Women FGD, Githunguri – Kiambu). In Makueni, one man in an FGD noted that “ It [the change] was essential because we could no longer predict when the rain would come, and one must look for food. So, one must look for other ways to harvest” (Men FGD, Ukia, Makueni). Discussions with key informants in the two counties affirmed the results from the FGD that events like prolonged droughts have driven actors to embrace change from conventional farming methods. According to a male key informant in Makueni, “the challenges of drought have driven the farmers in this area to start taking up climate-resilient practices” suggesting that producers were pushed to adapt their agricultural practices.

2.1.1.4 Cost of Inputs
Rising input costs, especially for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, were a significant motivator in Kiambu, specifically in Ndeiya, Lari and Githunguri. Discussions with key informants also confirmed that “the input prices were so high that farmers were not able to afford them. So, they dropped out of farming but later realized they could use their local resources like manure to continue with farming” (Man KII, Input Supplier, Makueni). In a women's FGD in Githunguri they said that “the prices of livestock feed were high at the time so we started working out ways of using farm materials to make feed for our livestock for us to sustain them and from there, we have never gone back to inorganic feeds” (Women FGD, Githunguri – Kaimbu). Reinforcing this view, discussions with men confirms that the cost of synthetic farm inputs “were too high compared to the profit hence making producers and retailers change their practices and start using locally available resources” (FGD Men, Lari - Kiambu). These high costs of inputs and feeds for the animals were noted to affect women more due to their limited decision-making power over the use of income on input acquisition. Having control over income and resources of production, men have a higher agency in accessing low-cost sustainable practices compared to women. With the prohibitive costs of inputs, men view the transition to alternative cost-effective solutions to sustain production as a necessity to maintain or increase the profit. Women on the other had to consider the transition as a way to sustain their production within their household decision- making constraints and as a potential solution for cheap and cost-effective food production.
2.1.1.5 Emerging Markets
Emerging local and international market opportunities for agroecological products also drive the agroecological transition in Kiambu County. Farmers, farmers + retailers and farmer + wholesalers equipped with knowledge about agroecological product markets gained higher price premiums from these markets in Nairobi and its environs. “There is a growing market for organic products where the prices are even better” (Man KII, Government, Kiambu). Men and women food suppliers (farmer + retailers and farmer + wholesalers) acknowledged that awareness among local consumers on the benefits of safe food and the risks of pesticide and heavy chemical residues has driven the demand for agroecological products as exemplified in the following voice. “Consumers are keen to know the safety of the foods they buy such as vegetables and many are increasingly demanding organic products only” (Women FGD, Ndeiya, Kiambu). Thus, consumer demand for safe food products continues to be a good driver for local agroecology produce markets while at the same time providing actors in the value chain better prices.
2.1.2. Policy changes
Although only mentioned in one focus group, the policy change that led to decentralizing the government system was reported as having a profound impact on farming practices as it brought agricultural officers and support services closer to local communities. One respondent from a men’s FGD in Mangu, Kiambu “ We started changing from conventional agriculture when we got a devolved system of government. That is when we started diving into agriculture, and the teachings on agriculture began. I believe we started doing those changes ten years ago. Some people were sent to teach us. I do not know what they were called, but I know those groups that came to teach us were from the Ministry of Agriculture”. With devolution, farmers gained easier access to expert guidance, leading to more frequent interactions with agricultural officers. This closer proximity allowed farmers to learn about soil health, irrigation methods, pest control, and other sustainable agricultural practices, resulting in a gradual shift from conventional to more efficient and environmentally friendly farming.

2.2. Drivers and enablers of agroecological transitions
The adoption of agroecological practices is influenced by various enablers that encourage behavior change. These enablers span individual, community, institutional, and environmental dimensions, impacting actors’ ability to adopt and sustain agroecological practices, which in turn is also influenced by their agency. These enablers impact diverse actors differently by gender and other aspects.

2.2.1. Individual dimension
2.2.1.1 Knowledge
Field demonstrations and peer-learning: Capacity building emerged as a critical enabler, fostering knowledge and self-efficacy among actors. Men tended to value the technical skills they obtained that allowed them to improve farm productivity and income as brought out in one FGD with men in Kiambu “The different training from many organizations has enabled us to maximize and expand our production” (Men FGD, Mangu – Kiambu). Conversely, women emphasized the value of their gains in agency and decision-making and sustainability in production. “The training has made us know how to store our seeds, make and source for organic inputs and use practices that suits our small sizes of land” (Women FGD, Ndeiya – Kiambu). Training sessions, peer learning, and hands-on demonstrations were instrumental in building confidence, especially for women producers who often preferred practical, field-based training. For many actors increased knowledge enabled more informed decision- making and greater agency in adopting new practices. A woman from Makueni shared, “learning from other farmers on how they are doing their farming has been a key factor in adopting the agroecological practices” (Women FGD, Kisau-Kiteta – Makueni).
Food safety consciousness: The study results show men, women, and youth farmers are conscious of the safety of the food they consume pushing farmers and consumers to seek safer alternatives. However, women appear to be more concerned than all the groups as exemplified in the following woman farmer’s voice: “We are now reverting to consuming those traditional foods because, firstly, we understand they are healthier […] We have people who engage in farming without using fertilizers,

Call to Action
Broaden Youth Engagement: 
Actively involve and support youth in all aspects of the agroecological value chain, particularly in roles that extend beyond traditional producer roles. Offer support that extends to land access constraints and other challenges faced by youth that have led to youth moving away from agriculture. 
Create Motivating Incentives for Sustainable Practices:
Work with private sector, cooperatives, and financial services, and government institutions to develop and implement incentive structures that offer tangible benefits like market access and certification advantages. These incentives can encourage farmers’ sustained practice of agroecology.
Foster Gender Equity in agroecological interventions: 
Actively involve men and women from the same household in every aspect of agroecological efforts, encourage shared responsibilities and benefits as well as tackle restrictive gender norms. This strategy could mitigate intra-household conflicts and promote equitable and effective agroecological transition.

Agroecology Initiative
1. INTRODUCCIÓN
La creciente necesidad de desarrollar procesos productivos sostenibles mediante la aplicación de prácticas agrícolas sostenibles y el enfoque de economía circular, ha impulsado la investigación en torno a los recursos orgánicos y su potencial para contribuir a la transición agroecológica, ya que uno de los principales cuellos de botella es la disponibilidad de fertilizantes orgánicos para una fertilización adecuada que cubra las necesidades nutricionales de los sistemas productivos, contribuyendo a la salud y equilibrio del suelo, el ciclo de nutrientes y la conservación de la biodiversidad mejorando la sostenibilidad y la resiliencia agrícola.
En este contexto, el ""Mapeo de Recursos Orgánicos para la Transición en los Paisajes Vivos Agroecológicos"", tiene como objetivo identificar y caracterizar los recursos orgánicos disponibles que vienen siendo utilizados como fertilizantes o con potencial de serlo dentro del corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía en términos de procedencia, acceso, cantidad y calidad nutricional; así como identificar oportunidades y limitaciones para su aprovechamiento. De esta manera, se contribuirá al desarrollo de estrategias efectivas que promuevan un uso sostenible de los recursos y fortalezcan la transición hacia sistemas agrícolas más sostenibles.
El ámbito geográfico del corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía abarca los distritos de Yarinacocha, Campo Verde y Nueva Requena de la provincia de Coronel Portillo y los distritos de Neshuya, Curimaná, Alexander Von Humboldt, Irazola, Huipoca, Padre Abad y Boquerón de la provincia de Padre Abad en el departamento de Ucayali.
2. METODOLOGÍA
Con el objetivo de realizar un mapeo exhaustivo sobre la disponibilidad de recursos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, el proceso de recojo de información se realizó en dos etapas: la entrevista a informantes clave y la entrevista a los productores y/o comercializadores de los recursos orgánicos.
2.1 Entrevista a informantes clave.
El objetivo de estas entrevistas fue identificar los recursos orgánicos disponibles y los principales actores vinculados a estos, en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía. Para efectos de este estudio, se consideraron como recursos orgánicos tanto los fertilizantes producidos y comercializados actualmente en el ámbito del estudio como la materia orgánica con potencial para ser utilizada en la elaboración de fertilizantes a mediana y gran escala. El proceso aplicado en esta etapa fue el siguiente:
• Identificación de informantes clave: Se identificaron 19 informantes clave: 11 de entidades estatales, cinco de empresas vinculadas con la producción orgánica y tres de ONGs (Ver anexo 7.1) con experiencia y/o con incidencia en actividades de investigación, transferencia, promoción y/o producción agrícola, pecuaria y forestal, con un enfoque sostenible que incluye el uso de fertilizantes orgánicos dentro del corredor Pucallpa - Aguaytía.
• Entrevista a informantes clave: se realizó la entrevista a todos los informantes identificados mediante un cuestionario con preguntas abiertas.
• Sistematización y análisis de entrevistas: las entrevistas fueron sistematizadas en Excel y en base a la información obtenida se planificó el levantamiento de información para el inventario de fertilizantes y residuos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa-Aguaytía.

2.2 Caracterización de los recursos orgánicos identificados.
La caracterización de los recursos orgánicos disponibles o con potencial dentro del corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, se basó en lo siguiente:
• Localización y convocatoria a los productores y comercializadores de recursos orgánicos identificados en las entrevistas a informantes clave.
• Encuesta a los comercializadores de fertilizantes orgánicos en las principales ciudades de los distritos del corredor, mediante encuestas semiestructuradas que abarcaron información sobre origen de los productos, canales de distribución, precios, disponibilidad, composición nutricional, así como las principales oportunidades y limitantes en la comercialización de los fertilizantes orgánicos.
• Encuesta a los productores de residuos y fertilizantes orgánicos, mediante la visita a los centros de producción y la aplicación de encuestas semi estructuradas que abarcaron información sobre caracterización de la fuente, la ubicación de los centros de producción, canales de distribución, volúmenes de producción, disponibilidad, composición nutricional, así como las principales oportunidades y limitantes en la producción de los recursos orgánicos.
• Muestreo y análisis en laboratorio de parámetros físicos, químicos y microbiológicos de los recursos orgánicos con potencial disponibilidad a mediana y gran escala, de acuerdo a lo establecido en el protocolo de muestreo.
3. RESULTADOS
Identificación de productores y/o comercializadores de recursos orgánicos.
Como resultado del inventario de recursos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, se han identificado 96 entidades, incluyendo empresas, instituciones, organizaciones y personas vinculadas con la producción y/o comercialización de fertilizantes orgánicos y materia orgánica con potencial para su producción en mediana y gran escala, según se detalla en la tabla 1.

• Productores de residuos orgánicos: grupo conformado principalmente por empresas que, como resultado de su actividad productiva, generan residuos orgánicos con potencial para ser transformados en fertilizantes líquidos o sólidos.
• Comercializadores de fertilizantes orgánicos: Empresas y personas con negocios dedicadas a la comercialización de insumos para la producción agropecuaria, entre los cuales se incluyen fertilizantes orgánicos (guano de isla y compost), así como los derivados de minerales primarios (rocas molidas).
• Productores de residuos y fertilizantes orgánicos: constituidos por empresas, organizaciones, instituciones y productores individuales que, a partir de su actividad productiva, generan residuos orgánicos, los cuales son utilizados total o parcialmente en la elaboración de fertilizantes orgánicos, para la venta al público en general, solo a sus socios o donaciones.

• Productores de fertilizantes orgánicos: constituido por empresas y personas naturales con negocio que se especializan en la elaboración de fertilizantes orgánicos sólidos y líquidos, utilizando residuos locales generados por terceros.
• Comercializadores de residuos orgánicos: empresas dedicadas a la recolección y comercialización de residuos orgánicos para su distribución y venta a terceros.
a) Disponibilidad de fertilizantes orgánicos.
En cuanto a la percepción sobre la disponibilidad de fertilizantes orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, el 63.2% de los entrevistados considera que su disponibilidad es nula o limitada, mientras que el 36.8% considera que existe suficiente disponibilidad (ver figura 1). Estos fertilizantes incluyen los elaborados a partir de residuos orgánicos, como compost, humus, biol, entre otros; así como aquellos derivados de minerales primarios, como las rocas molidas. En total, se han identificado 19 productores locales de fertilizantes orgánicos y 34 empresas que se dedican a la comercialización de fertilizantes orgánicos procedentes de otras zonas.

Figura 1. Percepción sobre disponibilidad de fertilizantes orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía
La percepción sobre la disponibilidad de los fertilizantes orgánicos podría estar influenciada por las cadenas productivas en las que participan los entrevistados. En el caso de aquellos involucrados directamente en la producción de palma aceitera o cacao, cuyas áreas de cultivo cuentan con certificación orgánica, la oferta actual resulta insuficiente. Esto se debe al gran volumen de fertilizantes orgánicos requeridos para cubrir las extensas áreas de cultivo y satisfacer sus necesidades nutricionales, debido a la menor concentración de los principales nutrientes (N, P y K) en los fertilizantes orgánicos.
Por ejemplo, en el caso de la palma aceitera, que cuenta con 1 400 hectáreas con certificación orgánica, la demanda de guano de isla fue de 600 toneladas en el 2024 y se proyecta que alcanzará las 1000 toneladas en el 2025, lo que equivaldría aproximadamente a 6 600 toneladas de compost con 1.5 a 2.0% de N (German Velásquez, comunicación personal, noviembre de 2024).
b) Disponibilidad de residuos orgánicos.
En relación con la percepción de la disponibilidad de residuos orgánicos con potencial para la elaboración de fertilizantes, el 57.9 % de los entrevistados considera que la disponibilidad es moderada a alta, mientras que el 42.1% considera que es limitada (ver figura 3). En este sentido, se han identificado 57 productores de residuos orgánicos de los cuales 15 elaboran fertilizantes orgánicos a partir de los residuos que generan.

Según los resultados obtenidos, se valorizan aproximadamente 365 827 toneladas anuales de residuos orgánicos, lo que representa el 82% del total de residuos generados (ver Tabla 3). En cuanto a los residuos no valorizados, como el aserrín, cáscara de frutas, cenizas, entre otros, el 96% se elimina a campo abierto y el 4% restante se dispone en botaderos municipales. Las principales formas de valorización de los residuos orgánicos incluyen la reutilización, la generación de energía y la elaboración de fertilizantes orgánicos. Las modalidades de valorización son las siguientes:
a) Elaboración de abonos orgánicos, tanto sólidos (compost, humus, biochar) como líquidos (biol), producidos por las mismas entidades que generan los residuos.
b) Reutilización, como fuente de materia orgánica para las áreas de cultivo de palma aceitera (escobajo, cenizas, lodo, gallinaza), arroz (ceniza de arroz), caña de azúcar (cenizas), cítricos, yuca (cenizas, estiércol, suero de leche) y pasturas (estiércol) de propiedad o vinculadas a las empresas que generan estos residuos orgánicos.
c) Venta como materia orgánica, destinados a la elaboración de abonos orgánicos o para su aplicación directa en campo, sin tratamiento o procesos de compostaje previos.

En cuanto a la estacionalidad de la producción de residuos orgánicos, debido a que la mayor parte de estos se derivan de la producción agropecuaria, su disponibilidad está estrechamente relacionada con la estacionalidad de los cultivos y con los ciclos de producción, determinados principalmente por las condiciones climáticas. En términos generales, se observa una menor disponibilidad entre los meses de abril a julio que coinciden con los meses de menor precipitación en la zona (ver Figura 9).

Se estima que anualmente se comercializan alrededor de 5 270 toneladas de fertilizantes orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía (ver Tabla 5). La mayor parte de este volumen se concentra en los distritos de Callería y Campo Verde, que representan el 81.6% del total. Los fertilizantes más demandados son el compost (75.7% del volumen comercializado) y el guano de isla (10.2% del volumen comercializado).

Figura 9. Mapa de distribución de los volúmenes de venta de fertilizantes orgánicos a nivel de distritos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía
El 99.4% (3966 toneladas) del compost comercializado en el corredor corresponde al compost de producción local, el cual es vendido directamente a los productores por parte de las empresas que
11
los elaboran. La diferencia corresponde principalmente al compost producido por empresas como la calera SAC y San Fernando, a partir de residuos avícolas, el cual es comercializados a través de las agroveterinarias locales.
El guano de isla, se distribuye principalmente a los agricultores a través de Agrorural, la entidad estatal encargada de gestionar oficialmente este recurso. Sin embargo, también se comercializa mediante agroveterinarias locales, aunque en estos canales no se garantiza el contenido de los principales macroelementos que caracterizan este fertilizante natural.

3.3 Limitantes y oportunidades
3.3.1 Innovaciones en la gestión de los recursos orgánicos
Impulsados por la creciente demanda de fertilizantes orgánicos, la necesidad de implementar enfoques de economía circular en las actividades productivas y la disponibilidad de residuos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, en los últimos años se han venido desarrollando varias iniciativas a nivel de investigación y aplicación para el manejo de estos residuos orgánicos en la elaboración de fertilizantes orgánicos sólido y líquidos y otros usos. Entre estos las principales innovaciones que se destacan, se incluyen:
a) Producción y aplicación de fertilizantes orgánicos sólidos y líquidos, esta categoría abarca diferentes formas de preparación de fertilizantes sólidos como compost, biochar y humus de lombriz, y líquidos como biol y humus líquido, enriquecidos tanto químicamente (micronutrientes) como biológicamente (microorganismos). Estos fertilizantes se vienen produciendo a diferentes escalas (grande y pequeña) y cuentan con equipos y maquinarias adaptadas a cada caso. Además, se destacan diversos métodos de aplicación como el uso de la técnica de drench, que facilita una mayor asimilación de nutrientes por las plantas.
b) Uso de microorganismos eficientes, esta práctica acelera los procesos de descomposición de la materia orgánica sin generar impactos ambientales negativos, mejorando las características microbiológicas de los fertilizantes.
c) Investigación en fertilizante orgánicos, se vienen desarrollando diversas investigaciones centradas en la elaboración de fertilizantes orgánicos, con énfasis en el uso de insumos locales y en la creación de formulaciones específicas para diferentes cultivos y sus distintas etapas fenológicas (floración, crecimiento, fructificación, etc.).
d) Nuevos usos para los residuos orgánicos, actualmente, se están aprovechando residuos como orujo, cáscaras de frutas y suero de leche en la alimentación de porcinos y bovinos. Además, se está evaluando el uso de lodo de palma aceitera para la alimentación de ganado vacuno. Otra innovación en este campo es el uso de harina de cáscara de aguaje, rica en proteínas y fibra, para la elaboración de galletas para consumo humano.
3.3.2 Oportunidades para la producción de fertilizantes orgánicos.
Para el análisis de las oportunidades identificadas en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, para la producción de fertilizantes orgánicos a partir de insumos locales, se han clasificado en las siguientes categorías:
a) Económica - productiva, la demanda de productos orgánicos sigue creciendo tanto en el mercado local como internacional, impulsada por los estilos de vida saludables y la creciente conciencia sobre los beneficios de los sistemas productivos sostenibles. Esto se presenta como una oportunidad para la actividad agropecuaria de la región, principalmente la ubicada en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía donde se vienen convirtiendo extensas áreas de cultivos como cacao y palma aceitera a sistemas de producción orgánica. Este proceso ha generado un aumento en la demanda de fertilizantes orgánicos, lo que ha fomentado el desarrollo de iniciativas para producir estos fertilizantes a partir de los residuos locales generados por las actividades productivas, como el cacao, la palma aceitera, el arroz, y las industrias ganaderas (bovina, porcina y avícola). Además, se han desarrollado servicios clave, como el acopio y distribución de residuos orgánicos (por ejemplo, gallinaza y pollaza), fortaleciendo aún más el
sector.
b) Investigación y desarrollo, la investigación y el desarrollo en la agricultura orgánica han sido fundamentales para la adopción de nuevas tecnologías que permiten el aprovechamiento de residuos orgánicos en la producción de fertilizantes. Diversas instituciones, como INIA Pucallpa, IIAP y universidades locales, están llevando a cabo proyectos de investigación y aplicaciones demostrativas en parcelas experimentales.
13
Estas iniciativas no solo contribuyen a reducir los costos de producción y mejorar las prácticas agrícolas, sino que también generan tecnologías que pueden ser adoptadas por empresas para la producción de fertilizantes y otros usos de residuos a mediana y gran escala. Este avance facilita la transición hacia una producción más sostenible y rentable.
c) Institucionales y normativas, las iniciativas institucionales para promover la economía circular, así como la producción orgánica y agroecológica entre estas la implementación del Sistema de garantía Participativo (SGP) como una alternativa de certificación de la producción orgánica, juegan un papel crucial en la regulación y expansión de este sector, ya que permitiría acceder a la certificación orgánica a grupos de productores y sistemas de producción orientados al mercado local.

Agroecology Initiative
1. INTRODUCCIÓN
La creciente necesidad de desarrollar procesos productivos sostenibles mediante la aplicación de prácticas agrícolas sostenibles y el enfoque de economía circular, ha impulsado la investigación en torno a los recursos orgánicos y su potencial para contribuir a la transición agroecológica, ya que uno de los principales cuellos de botella es la disponibilidad de fertilizantes orgánicos para una fertilización adecuada que cubra las necesidades nutricionales de los sistemas productivos, contribuyendo a la salud y equilibrio del suelo, el ciclo de nutrientes y la conservación de la biodiversidad mejorando la sostenibilidad y la resiliencia agrícola.
En este contexto, el ""Mapeo de Recursos Orgánicos para la Transición en los Paisajes Vivos Agroecológicos"", tiene como objetivo identificar y caracterizar los recursos orgánicos disponibles que vienen siendo utilizados como fertilizantes o con potencial de serlo dentro del corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía en términos de procedencia, acceso, cantidad y calidad nutricional; así como identificar oportunidades y limitaciones para su aprovechamiento. De esta manera, se contribuirá al desarrollo de estrategias efectivas que promuevan un uso sostenible de los recursos y fortalezcan la transición hacia sistemas agrícolas más sostenibles.
El ámbito geográfico del corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía abarca los distritos de Yarinacocha, Campo Verde y Nueva Requena de la provincia de Coronel Portillo y los distritos de Neshuya, Curimaná, Alexander Von Humboldt, Irazola, Huipoca, Padre Abad y Boquerón de la provincia de Padre Abad en el departamento de Ucayali.
2. METODOLOGÍA
Con el objetivo de realizar un mapeo exhaustivo sobre la disponibilidad de recursos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, el proceso de recojo de información se realizó en dos etapas: la entrevista a informantes clave y la entrevista a los productores y/o comercializadores de los recursos orgánicos.
2.1 Entrevista a informantes clave.
El objetivo de estas entrevistas fue identificar los recursos orgánicos disponibles y los principales actores vinculados a estos, en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía. Para efectos de este estudio, se consideraron como recursos orgánicos tanto los fertilizantes producidos y comercializados actualmente en el ámbito del estudio como la materia orgánica con potencial para ser utilizada en la elaboración de fertilizantes a mediana y gran escala. El proceso aplicado en esta etapa fue el siguiente:
• Identificación de informantes clave: Se identificaron 19 informantes clave: 11 de entidades estatales, cinco de empresas vinculadas con la producción orgánica y tres de ONGs (Ver anexo 7.1) con experiencia y/o con incidencia en actividades de investigación, transferencia, promoción y/o producción agrícola, pecuaria y forestal, con un enfoque sostenible que incluye el uso de fertilizantes orgánicos dentro del corredor Pucallpa - Aguaytía.
• Entrevista a informantes clave: se realizó la entrevista a todos los informantes identificados mediante un cuestionario con preguntas abiertas.
• Sistematización y análisis de entrevistas: las entrevistas fueron sistematizadas en Excel y en base a la información obtenida se planificó el levantamiento de información para el inventario de fertilizantes y residuos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa-Aguaytía.

2.2 Caracterización de los recursos orgánicos identificados.
La caracterización de los recursos orgánicos disponibles o con potencial dentro del corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, se basó en lo siguiente:
• Localización y convocatoria a los productores y comercializadores de recursos orgánicos identificados en las entrevistas a informantes clave.
• Encuesta a los comercializadores de fertilizantes orgánicos en las principales ciudades de los distritos del corredor, mediante encuestas semiestructuradas que abarcaron información sobre origen de los productos, canales de distribución, precios, disponibilidad, composición nutricional, así como las principales oportunidades y limitantes en la comercialización de los fertilizantes orgánicos.
• Encuesta a los productores de residuos y fertilizantes orgánicos, mediante la visita a los centros de producción y la aplicación de encuestas semi estructuradas que abarcaron información sobre caracterización de la fuente, la ubicación de los centros de producción, canales de distribución, volúmenes de producción, disponibilidad, composición nutricional, así como las principales oportunidades y limitantes en la producción de los recursos orgánicos.
• Muestreo y análisis en laboratorio de parámetros físicos, químicos y microbiológicos de los recursos orgánicos con potencial disponibilidad a mediana y gran escala, de acuerdo a lo establecido en el protocolo de muestreo.
3. RESULTADOS
Identificación de productores y/o comercializadores de recursos orgánicos.
Como resultado del inventario de recursos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, se han identificado 96 entidades, incluyendo empresas, instituciones, organizaciones y personas vinculadas con la producción y/o comercialización de fertilizantes orgánicos y materia orgánica con potencial para su producción en mediana y gran escala, según se detalla en la tabla 1.
Tabla 1. Entidades clave en la producción y comercialización de recursos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa-Aguaytía

• Productores de fertilizantes orgánicos: constituido por empresas y personas naturales con negocio que se especializan en la elaboración de fertilizantes orgánicos sólidos y líquidos, utilizando residuos locales generados por terceros.
• Comercializadores de residuos orgánicos: empresas dedicadas a la recolección y comercialización de residuos orgánicos para su distribución y venta a terceros.
a) Disponibilidad de fertilizantes orgánicos.
En cuanto a la percepción sobre la disponibilidad de fertilizantes orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, el 63.2% de los entrevistados considera que su disponibilidad es nula o limitada, mientras que el 36.8% considera que existe suficiente disponibilidad (ver figura 1). Estos fertilizantes incluyen los elaborados a partir de residuos orgánicos, como compost, humus, biol, entre otros; así como aquellos derivados de minerales primarios, como las rocas molidas. En total, se han identificado 19 productores locales de fertilizantes orgánicos y 34 empresas que se dedican a la comercialización de fertilizantes orgánicos procedentes de otras zonas.

Figura 1. Percepción sobre disponibilidad de fertilizantes orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía
La percepción sobre la disponibilidad de los fertilizantes orgánicos podría estar influenciada por las cadenas productivas en las que participan los entrevistados. En el caso de aquellos involucrados directamente en la producción de palma aceitera o cacao, cuyas áreas de cultivo cuentan con certificación orgánica, la oferta actual resulta insuficiente. Esto se debe al gran volumen de fertilizantes orgánicos requeridos para cubrir las extensas áreas de cultivo y satisfacer sus necesidades nutricionales, debido a la menor concentración de los principales nutrientes (N, P y K) en los fertilizantes orgánicos.
Por ejemplo, en el caso de la palma aceitera, que cuenta con 1 400 hectáreas con certificación orgánica, la demanda de guano de isla fue de 600 toneladas en el 2024 y se proyecta que alcanzará las 1000 toneladas en el 2025, lo que equivaldría aproximadamente a 6 600 toneladas de compost con 1.5 a 2.0% de N (German Velásquez, comunicación personal, noviembre de 2024).
b) Disponibilidad de residuos orgánicos.
En relación con la percepción de la disponibilidad de residuos orgánicos con potencial para la elaboración de fertilizantes, el 57.9 % de los entrevistados considera que la disponibilidad es moderada a alta, mientras que el 42.1% considera que es limitada (ver figura 3). En este sentido, se han identificado 57 productores de residuos orgánicos de los cuales 15 elaboran fertilizantes orgánicos a partir de los residuos que generan.

Según los resultados obtenidos, se valorizan aproximadamente 365 827 toneladas anuales de residuos orgánicos, lo que representa el 82% del total de residuos generados (ver Tabla 3). En cuanto a los residuos no valorizados, como el aserrín, cáscara de frutas, cenizas, entre otros, el 96% se elimina a campo abierto y el 4% restante se dispone en botaderos municipales. Las principales formas de valorización de los residuos orgánicos incluyen la reutilización, la generación de energía y la elaboración de fertilizantes orgánicos. Las modalidades de valorización son las siguientes:
a) Elaboración de abonos orgánicos, tanto sólidos (compost, humus, biochar) como líquidos (biol), producidos por las mismas entidades que generan los residuos.
b) Reutilización, como fuente de materia orgánica para las áreas de cultivo de palma aceitera (escobajo, cenizas, lodo, gallinaza), arroz (ceniza de arroz), caña de azúcar (cenizas), cítricos, yuca (cenizas, estiércol, suero de leche) y pasturas (estiércol) de propiedad o vinculadas a las empresas que generan estos residuos orgánicos.
c) Venta como materia orgánica, destinados a la elaboración de abonos orgánicos o para su aplicación directa en campo, sin tratamiento o procesos de compostaje previos.

En cuanto a la estacionalidad de la producción de residuos orgánicos, debido a que la mayor parte de estos se derivan de la producción agropecuaria, su disponibilidad está estrechamente relacionada con la estacionalidad de los cultivos y con los ciclos de producción, determinados principalmente por las condiciones climáticas. En términos generales, se observa una menor disponibilidad entre los meses de abril a julio que coinciden con los meses de menor precipitación en la zona (ver Figura 9).

El 94.9 % de los fertilizantes producidos son sólidos, principalmente compost elaborado a partir de residuos vegetales y/o animales complementados principalmente con suplementos minerales (microelementos y minerales primarios) para enriquecer el producto final, así como microorganismos para acelerar el proceso de descomposición. En cuanto a la certificación, tres empresas están certificadas (OLAMSA) o en proceso de certificación orgánica (Pucafert del Oriente SAC y Organic Amazon SAC), las cuales producen 3 660 toneladas de compost anualmente, lo que representa el 71.8% del compost producido localmente.
El 5.1% restante corresponde a fertilizantes líquidos, principalmente biol, elaborado a partir de residuos animales complementados con micronutrientes y microorganismos. Ninguno de estos productos cuenta con certificación orgánica, pero cuatro empresas tienen la ficha técnica de sus productos, lo que representa el 99% de los fertilizantes líquidos producidos localmente.

Cabe señalar que el 20.9% de los fertilizantes sólidos producidos en el corredor (1125 toneladas) se destina al autoconsumo de las empresas que los elaboran y a la donación. Por ejemplo, en el caso del compost producido por los programas de segregación de residuos sólidos de los gobiernos locales, así como parte del compost producido por la Cervecería San Juan, son donados a colegios, áreas verdes urbanas, entre otros.
En cuanto a los bioles, el 93.2 % de la producción (268.2 ton) se destina al autoconsumo, como es el caso de los módulos comunales promovidos por DEVIDA y la Cooperativa Banaqui.
En relación con la estacionalidad de la producción de fertilizantes orgánicos, se observa un aumento en la producción entre los meses de octubre a diciembre, coincidiendo con el periodo de mayor generación de residuos orgánicos.

3.2.3 Comercialización de recursos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa-Aguaytía
La demanda de recursos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa-Aguaytía está experimentando un crecimiento significativo, impulsado principalmente por las tendencias del mercado que favorecen la producción agrícola orgánica. El 74.8 % de los entrevistados considera que la demanda de fertilizantes orgánicos sigue una tendencia creciente (ver Figura 8), debido principalmente al incremento de áreas con certificación orgánica, especialmente en cultivos como palma aceitera y cacao. En el caso del cacao, el reciente incremento de los precios, ha jugado un papel importante, ya que ha permitido a los productores invertir más en la fertilización de sus áreas de cultivo.

Se estima que anualmente se comercializan alrededor de 5 270 toneladas de fertilizantes orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía (ver Tabla 5). La mayor parte de este volumen se concentra en los distritos de Callería y Campo Verde, que representan el 81.6% del total. Los fertilizantes más demandados son el compost (75.7% del volumen comercializado) y el guano de isla (10.2% del volumen comercializado).

Figura 9. Mapa de distribución de los volúmenes de venta de fertilizantes orgánicos a nivel de distritos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía
El 99.4% (3966 toneladas) del compost comercializado en el corredor corresponde al compost de producción local, el cual es vendido directamente a los productores por parte de las empresas que
11
los elaboran. La diferencia corresponde principalmente al compost producido por empresas como la calera SAC y San Fernando, a partir de residuos avícolas, el cual es comercializados a través de las agroveterinarias locales.
El guano de isla, se distribuye principalmente a los agricultores a través de Agrorural, la entidad estatal encargada de gestionar oficialmente este recurso. Sin embargo, también se comercializa mediante agroveterinarias locales, aunque en estos canales no se garantiza el contenido de los principales macroelementos que caracterizan este fertilizante natural.

3.3 Limitantes y oportunidades
3.3.1 Innovaciones en la gestión de los recursos orgánicos
Impulsados por la creciente demanda de fertilizantes orgánicos, la necesidad de implementar enfoques de economía circular en las actividades productivas y la disponibilidad de residuos orgánicos en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, en los últimos años se han venido desarrollando varias iniciativas a nivel de investigación y aplicación para el manejo de estos residuos orgánicos en la elaboración de fertilizantes orgánicos sólido y líquidos y otros usos. Entre estos las principales innovaciones que se destacan, se incluyen:
a) Producción y aplicación de fertilizantes orgánicos sólidos y líquidos, esta categoría abarca diferentes formas de preparación de fertilizantes sólidos como compost, biochar y humus de lombriz, y líquidos como biol y humus líquido, enriquecidos tanto químicamente (micronutrientes) como biológicamente (microorganismos). Estos fertilizantes se vienen produciendo a diferentes escalas (grande y pequeña) y cuentan con equipos y maquinarias adaptadas a cada caso. Además, se destacan diversos métodos de aplicación como el uso de la técnica de drench, que facilita una mayor asimilación de nutrientes por las plantas.
b) Uso de microorganismos eficientes, esta práctica acelera los procesos de descomposición de la materia orgánica sin generar impactos ambientales negativos, mejorando las características microbiológicas de los fertilizantes.
c) Investigación en fertilizante orgánicos, se vienen desarrollando diversas investigaciones centradas en la elaboración de fertilizantes orgánicos, con énfasis en el uso de insumos locales y en la creación de formulaciones específicas para diferentes cultivos y sus distintas etapas fenológicas (floración, crecimiento, fructificación, etc.).
d) Nuevos usos para los residuos orgánicos, actualmente, se están aprovechando residuos como orujo, cáscaras de frutas y suero de leche en la alimentación de porcinos y bovinos. Además, se está evaluando el uso de lodo de palma aceitera para la alimentación de ganado vacuno. Otra innovación en este campo es el uso de harina de cáscara de aguaje, rica en proteínas y fibra, para la elaboración de galletas para consumo humano.
3.3.2 Oportunidades para la producción de fertilizantes orgánicos.
Para el análisis de las oportunidades identificadas en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía, para la producción de fertilizantes orgánicos a partir de insumos locales, se han clasificado en las siguientes categorías:
a) Económica - productiva, la demanda de productos orgánicos sigue creciendo tanto en el mercado local como internacional, impulsada por los estilos de vida saludables y la creciente conciencia sobre los beneficios de los sistemas productivos sostenibles. Esto se presenta como una oportunidad para la actividad agropecuaria de la región, principalmente la ubicada en el corredor Pucallpa – Aguaytía donde se vienen convirtiendo extensas áreas de cultivos como cacao y palma aceitera a sistemas de producción orgánica. Este proceso ha generado un aumento en la demanda de fertilizantes orgánicos, lo que ha fomentado el desarrollo de iniciativas para producir estos fertilizantes a partir de los residuos locales generados por las actividades productivas, como el cacao, la palma aceitera, el arroz, y las industrias ganaderas (bovina, porcina y avícola). Además, se han desarrollado servicios clave, como el acopio y distribución de residuos orgánicos (por ejemplo, gallinaza y pollaza), fortaleciendo aún más el
sector.
b) Investigación y desarrollo, la investigación y el desarrollo en la agricultura orgánica han sido fundamentales para la adopción de nuevas tecnologías que permiten el aprovechamiento de residuos orgánicos en la producción de fertilizantes. Diversas instituciones, como INIA Pucallpa, IIAP y universidades locales, están llevando a cabo proyectos de investigación y aplicaciones demostrativas en parcelas experimentales.
13
Estas iniciativas no solo contribuyen a reducir los costos de producción y mejorar las prácticas agrícolas, sino que también generan tecnologías que pueden ser adoptadas por empresas para la producción de fertilizantes y otros usos de residuos a mediana y gran escala. Este avance facilita la transición hacia una producción más sostenible y rentable.
c) Institucionales y normativas, las iniciativas institucionales para promover la economía circular, así como la producción orgánica y agroecológica entre estas la implementación del Sistema de garantía Participativo (SGP) como una alternativa de certificación de la producción orgánica, juegan un papel crucial en la regulación y expansión de este sector, ya que permitiría acceder a la certificación orgánica a grupos de productores y sistemas de producción orientados al mercado local.
Por otro lado, el gobierno, a través de programas de promoción y capacitación, apoya a los pequeños agricultores en la producción y uso de abon"

INITIATIVE ON
Aquatic Foods
Introduction
This technical brief provides an overview of the formal policy context of Ghana’s fisheries with a focus on aquaculture, which can be traced back to the 1950s (Abban et al. 2009). Despite the focus on inland fisheries, the policy architecture tends to bring both marine and inland fisheries under the same broader legislative frameworks. Formal policies entail governance arrangements such as laws, policies, plans and regulations. Informal policies are based on customs accepted by local traditional authorities; such local practices may or may not be accepted by formal authorities or the state (FAO et al. 2023).
Fish is the main source of protein for most of the households in Ghana (FAO 2016). Fisheries and aquaculture account for 4.5 percent of the National Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which is about 12 percent of the agricultural GDP (Alhassan and Akongyuure 2020; World Bank 2019). The sector is gendered — men mostly undertake the actual fishing, while women are engaged in postharvest activities (Appiah et al. 2021). Aquaculture production in Ghana largely focuses on the Nile tilapia and catfish, representing 43 percent of the freshwater fish production in Ghana (World Bank 2019). Majority of aquaculture farms employ the extensive culture system using cages, ponds, tanks, dams, dugouts and reservoirs for the fish culture. Aquaculture production offers an opportunity to increase fish supply especially in light of the declining fish catches from the marine sector. The country has a per capita fish consumption of 26 kg which is 6 kg above the global average of 20 kg/ per capita (World Bank 2019). Fish is deeply central to Ghana, providing employment, nutrition and financial security (Akongyuure et al. 2017; Bene et al. 2015).
This technical brief is based on a literature review assessing the legal framework governing fisheries (specifically aquaculture) in Ghana. This entails deploying historical and current perspectives in surveying the laws and policies governing fisheries. Aquaculture has largely been governed by the fisheries legislations. This report also outlines the fisheries and aquaculture management plans and other frameworks which govern aquaculture management in Ghana.
Aquatic foods account for 60 percent of Ghana’s national dietary intake of animal protein (Rurangwa et al. 2015; Chan et al. 2019), about four times higher than the global average (Hishamunda et al. 2009). Ghana is an exception in the African continent with its high per capita fish intake of 26 kg. The current national fish supply deficit — filled by imports — is about 640,182.47 metric tonnes (t) or 50.10 percent of the total fish production as per the 2021 Annual Performance Report from Fisheries Commission. Marine fish production was the major source of Ghanian fish production but has been declining since the past two decades. Fish production has decreased from 420,000 t in 1999 to 393,970 t in 2021 (FAO, 2016, Fisheries Commission, 2022). On the other hand, inland and aquaculture fisheries production has been on the increase. Aquaculture production has seen a steady growth since 2008 with significant increases in recent years. Ghana’s new National Aquaculture Development Plan (2022–2026) targets an increase in the market share of commercially farmed fish from 14 percent in 2021 to 25 percent in 2027.
The map of Ghana, indicating its location and the constituent regions, is shown in Figure 1.
Aquaculture production in Ghana has grown from 5,590 t in 2008 to 76,630 t in 2018. Due to the incidence of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) which attacked most cage fish farms on the Volta Lake, aquaculture production dropped to 52,360 t in 2019.
In the following year (2020), aquaculture production increased to 64,010 t which could be a result of government intervention to the sector by the provision of free vaccines to the affected fish farms. The aquaculture production further rose to 89,375.48 t in 2021 (Fisheries Commission 2022). Unlike capture fisheries, aquaculture is only expanding, with the potential to increase further (Statista 2023). Aquaculture growth was largely driven by large-scale cage aquaculture (Ragasa et al. 2022; Ragasa et al. 2018). In Ghana, tilapia remains the most popular cultured fish, with cage culture accounting for the largest share of fish production. Catfish output has witnessed major growth recently, with production reaching a high of 20,660.95 t in 2021 compared to 16,321.96 t in 2020 and 13,063.41 t in 2019 (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), 2023).
Fisheries and aquaculture in the context of Ghana
Small-scale pond aquaculture has great promise for smallholder farmers to be engaged and derive livelihoods, with profit margins of about 27 percent (Ragasa et al. 2022). The Government of Ghana views aquaculture as enabling increasing fish production while creating employment and wealth creation opportunities (Fisheries Commission 2022). As a result, initiatives such as Aquaculture for food and Jobs (AfJ) were introduced, and the National Aquaculture Training Center was established in 2023 to create jobs and increase domestic fish production.
Ghana is a country in West Africa with a total population of 30.8 million of which 50.7 percent are women and 49.3 percent are men (Ghana Statistical Services 2021).

The expansion of aquaculture according to Ragasa et al. 2022 and Fisheries Commission 2022 is attributed to the following reasons:
1. The availability of an improved local tilapia (the Akosombo strain) since 2005.
2. Pro-aquaculture government policy support initiatives — pro-aquaculture policies successfully aided the growth in the aquaculture sector witnessed from early 2010s.
3. Improved hatcheries and grow-out production systems.
4. Presence of high-quality feeds in the local market (Ragasa et al. 2018).
5. Market availability due to demand exceeding supply (Fisheries Commission 2022).
Learnings from fisheries and aquaculture policies and governance landscape
Aquaculture contribution to the
The brief technical review of the fisheries and aquaculture policy terrain in Ghana as well as insights from the current IWMI-FC- CSIR WRI ongoing piloting of the aquaculture interventions in four small water infrastructure (dams) help underscore the following thematic discussion points.
economy
The contribution of fisheries to the GDP has been declining from 1.49 percent in 2013 to 1.04 percent in 2021 (Fisheries Commission 2022). Table 1 details the contribution of aquaculture to the GDP.
Fisheries legal architecture
The evolution of the key Fisheries Legal Framework in Ghana and its implication on aquaculture has been summarized in Table 2.
Sound Policies – Link with Practice
Ghana has robust policies and legal frameworks which govern the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. The policies, however, need to be enforced and implemented for better development outcomes. For instance, the policies recognize the importance of science and innovation within the fisheries sector to further enhance aquaculture productivity. However, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD) lacks adequate resources to ensure increased productivity. At times, even the allocated budget, already low, is not fully disbursed to MoFAD which further undermines the aquaculture activities. While MOFAD tends to have one of the smallest budgets in Ghana, on occasion it does not receive its full allocation from the Ministry of Finance.

Breeding of fish is key to ensure that aquaculture productivity is high.
The Fisheries Commission does not seem to receive the adequate financial support despite the establishment of the Fisheries Fund. This further undermines the effectiveness of the aquaculture interventions given the potential contribution of this sector. The Akosombo tilapia strain, which has been a success in Ghana, now needs to be upgraded. There is need for continuous research into fish breeding to ensure that the sector has quality fish seed with good growth performance, disease resistance, and tolerance to a wide range of temperature fluctuations. New culturable species are also needed to increase variety and keep the industry vibrant.
developed also map out the funding sources from the private sector. Such plans can include stakeholder engagements to explore different funding mechanisms for the proposed programmes. Considering the risk associated with culturing fish, assisting farmers to engage and explore tailored insurance schemes is crucial.
One Health Perspective
Diseases are a major setback for the aquaculture, and more broadly, for the fisheries sector. However, it is important to understand such diseases within the larger purview of fish and human disease interactions to develop holistic solutions for addressing fish diseases.
Gender Equality and Social Inclusion
Policy Harmonization
Cross sectoral policy harmonization is a major concern to ensure that, for instance, the aquaculture policies are aligned with the customs and import regulations for keeping feeds cost affordable because feed accounts for more than two-thirds of the input cost for the aquaculture farmers. Smart subsidies to enhance local quality fish feeds production in partnership with the Fisheries Commission and CSIR WRI might be a potential long-term solution in light of the government prioritizing aquaculture production. Small-scale fisheries benefit through discounted fuel costs under the National Premix Fuel Committee Regulations (L.I. 2233) despite the persistent fish decline in the marine sector. Special targeted subsidies could be planned within the aquaculture sector. These would require to be critically evaluated to safeguard against further distortions within the broader market and negative impacts on the resource base.
Aquaculture should offer an opportunity for increasing opportunities for women, youths and other marginalized communities in line with Sustainable Development Goal 5. The Government of Ghana has identified this gap as part of AfJ. However, for more informed gender inclusion, evidence of gender barriers needs to be provided for women, youths and other vulnerable communities to generate benefits from technical aquaculture innovations. Unlocking such identified barriers will ensure that the technical solutions are grounded within the social context where the innovations are being introduced. Such an approach will avail more sustainable aquatic investment solutions.
Disconnect Between Policy and Implementation
Multiple Use Systems
Multiple Use Systems which are holistic need to be incorporated for more efficient and productive aquaculture sector. Existing policies tend to be largely sector-specific. It is interesting to note that under the 1V1D initiative, the main thrust was on domestic water supply, livestock watering and crop irrigation with no considerations for aquaculture. With more than 300 additional small water reservoirs constructed in the northern regions of Ghana under the initiative, it could have offered opportunity for other uses such as aquaculture. The next phase of the 1V1D initiative should consider incorporating aquaculture in its design and implementation. This will allow future dams to ensure suitability for aquaculture production. It can increase the basket of benefits coming from small water infrastructure and will also contribute toward further improvements in nutrition and financial income streams, particularly in northern Ghana where access to fish is limited.
One of the confounding challenges in Ghana, and sub- Saharan Africa at large, is the large number of policy instruments which have been developed but remain unimplemented. While policies are important, they are not sufficient to bring about on-ground transformation of men, women and youths. A number of reasons have been offered, of which one is the lack of financial resources to implement the mandate that the law provides. Within the broader fisheries sector in Ghana, the enforcement of marine fisheries permit system is an example. This has not been very effective due to limited capacity and resources to patrol the Ghanaian waters. Feed costs are a major expenditure within the aquaculture sector, covering more than 70 percent of the total production cost. However, not enough funds have been invested to ensure that Ghana’s fish feed requirements are produced locally and reduce the impact on foreign exchange demands and price volatility risk on aquaculture farmers. Other reasons provided at the sub-Saharan level are that policy initiatives are sometimes inspired from the international level; there may be insufficient capability and willingness to enforce them at national level.
Innovative Financing Models for Aquaculture
Quality Fingerling Production and High Feed Cost
The Government of Ghana developed a number of programmes, including the AfJ. The success of the programmes hinges on the availability of private sector financing, especially in light of limited state resources. It is, therefore, important to ensure that the programmes
Productivity of aquaculture is impacted by the quality of the fingerlings that the farmers are able to access as well as the high cost of fish feed. In Ghana, fingerling production will not be able to cater to the projected increase in aquaculture production. Plans to increase

both public and private quality fingerling production — located strategically across different parts of the country — are thus vital. The role of the private sector needs to be promoted because the share for fingerling production by the private sector has ballooned from 1 percent to 90 percent (Abban et al., 2009). Similarly, the private sector and farmers should be trained and assisted in quality local feed production to reduce the high input cost. While increased fingerling production and local feed production are welcome, the regulatory role of the state must be further enhanced to guarantee compliance with standards and good practices which might end up being compromised in pursuit of profits. The recently held aquaculture conference from 26 to 27 April 2023, revealed that some ongoing fish vaccination activities could only muster limited engagement of the state.
Conclusion
This technical brief has outlined some of the broader issues on fisheries, and more specifically on aquaculture in Ghana. Aquaculture can significantly contribute to offsetting the declining rate of marine and inland capture fisheries. Beyond good policies, practical implementation strategies and resources are necessary for the effectiveness of fisheries and aquaculture policies in Ghana. This calls for a strategic policy and practice reflection to secure the promotion of individual and collective action for enhancing aquaculture production. Encouraging multiple use systems under the 1V1D programme and the AfJ will offer nutrition, employment and income opportunities for women, youths and other vulnerable members of the community. Policy harmonization and sustainable financing mechanisms will also ensure the sustainability of the project.

INITIATIVE ON
Aquatic Foods
Introduction
This technical brief provides an overview of the formal policy context of Ghana’s fisheries with a focus on aquaculture, which can be traced back to the 1950s (Abban et al. 2009). Despite the focus on inland fisheries, the policy architecture tends to bring both marine and inland fisheries under the same broader legislative frameworks. Formal policies entail governance arrangements such as laws, policies, plans and regulations. Informal policies are based on customs accepted by local traditional authorities; such local practices may or may not be accepted by formal authorities or the state (FAO et al. 2023).
Fish is the main source of protein for most of the households in Ghana (FAO 2016). Fisheries and aquaculture account for 4.5 percent of the National Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which is about 12 percent of the agricultural GDP (Alhassan and Akongyuure 2020; World Bank 2019). The sector is gendered — men mostly undertake the actual fishing, while women are engaged in postharvest activities (Appiah et al. 2021). Aquaculture production in Ghana largely focuses on the Nile tilapia and catfish, representing 43 percent of the freshwater fish production in Ghana (World Bank 2019). Majority of aquaculture farms employ the extensive culture system using cages, ponds, tanks, dams, dugouts and reservoirs for the fish culture. Aquaculture production offers an opportunity to increase fish supply especially in light of the declining fish catches from the marine sector. The country has a per capita fish consumption of 26 kg which is 6 kg above the global average of 20 kg/ per capita (World Bank 2019). Fish is deeply central to Ghana, providing employment, nutrition and financial security (Akongyuure et al. 2017; Bene et al. 2015).
This technical brief is based on a literature review assessing the legal framework governing fisheries (specifically aquaculture) in Ghana. This entails deploying historical and current perspectives in surveying the laws and policies governing fisheries. Aquaculture has largely been governed by the fisheries legislations. This report also outlines the fisheries and aquaculture management plans and other frameworks which govern aquaculture management in Ghana.
Aquatic foods account for 60 percent of Ghana’s national dietary intake of animal protein (Rurangwa et al. 2015; Chan et al. 2019), about four times higher than the global average (Hishamunda et al. 2009). Ghana is an exception in the African continent with its high per capita fish intake of 26 kg. The current national fish supply deficit — filled by imports — is about 640,182.47 metric tonnes (t) or 50.10 percent of the total fish production as per the 2021 Annual Performance Report from Fisheries Commission. Marine fish production was the major source of Ghanian fish production but has been declining since the past two decades. Fish production has decreased from 420,000 t in 1999 to 393,970 t in 2021 (FAO, 2016, Fisheries Commission, 2022). On the other hand, inland and aquaculture fisheries production has been on the increase. Aquaculture production has seen a steady growth since 2008 with significant increases in recent years. Ghana’s new National Aquaculture Development Plan (2022–2026) targets an increase in the market share of commercially farmed fish from 14 percent in 2021 to 25 percent in 2027.
The map of Ghana, indicating its location and the constituent regions, is shown in Figure 1.
Aquaculture production in Ghana has grown from 5,590 t in 2008 to 76,630 t in 2018. Due to the incidence of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) which attacked most cage fish farms on the Volta Lake, aquaculture production dropped to 52,360 t in 2019.
In the following year (2020), aquaculture production increased to 64,010 t which could be a result of government intervention to the sector by the provision of free vaccines to the affected fish farms. The aquaculture production further rose to 89,375.48 t in 2021 (Fisheries Commission 2022). Unlike capture fisheries, aquaculture is only expanding, with the potential to increase further (Statista 2023). Aquaculture growth was largely driven by large-scale cage aquaculture (Ragasa et al. 2022; Ragasa et al. 2018). In Ghana, tilapia remains the most popular cultured fish, with cage culture accounting for the largest share of fish production. Catfish output has witnessed major growth recently, with production reaching a high of 20,660.95 t in 2021 compared to 16,321.96 t in 2020 and 13,063.41 t in 2019 (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), 2023).
Fisheries and aquaculture in the context of Ghana
Small-scale pond aquaculture has great promise for smallholder farmers to be engaged and derive livelihoods, with profit margins of about 27 percent (Ragasa et al. 2022). The Government of Ghana views aquaculture as enabling increasing fish production while creating employment and wealth creation opportunities (Fisheries Commission 2022). As a result, initiatives such as Aquaculture for food and Jobs (AfJ) were introduced, and the National Aquaculture Training Center was established in 2023 to create jobs and increase domestic fish production.
Ghana is a country in West Africa with a total population of 30.8 million of which 50.7 percent are women and 49.3 percent are men (Ghana Statistical Services 2021).
Figure 2 shows the aquaculture production figures in Ghana.

The expansion of aquaculture according to Ragasa et al. 2022 and Fisheries Commission 2022 is attributed to the following reasons:
1. The availability of an improved local tilapia (the Akosombo strain) since 2005.
2. Pro-aquaculture government policy support initiatives — pro-aquaculture policies successfully aided the growth in the aquaculture sector witnessed from early 2010s.
3. Improved hatcheries and grow-out production systems.
4. Presence of high-quality feeds in the local market (Ragasa et al. 2018).
5. Market availability due to demand exceeding supply (Fisheries Commission 2022).

economy
The contribution of fisheries to the GDP has been declining from 1.49 percent in 2013 to 1.04 percent in 2021 (Fisheries Commission 2022). Table 1 details the contribution of aquaculture to the GDP.
Fisheries legal architecture
The evolution of the key Fisheries Legal Framework in Ghana and its implication on aquaculture has been summarized in Table 2.
Sound Policies – Link with Practice
Ghana has robust policies and legal frameworks which govern the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. The policies, however, need to be enforced and implemented for better development outcomes. For instance, the policies recognize the importance of science and innovation within the fisheries sector to further enhance aquaculture productivity. However, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD) lacks adequate resources to ensure increased productivity. At times, even the allocated budget, already low, is not fully disbursed to MoFAD which further undermines the aquaculture activities. While MOFAD tends to have one of the smallest budgets in Ghana, on occasion it does not receive its full allocation from the Ministry of Finance.

Breeding of fish is key to ensure that aquaculture productivity is high.
The Fisheries Commission does not seem to receive the adequate financial support despite the establishment of the Fisheries Fund. This further undermines the effectiveness of the aquaculture interventions given the potential contribution of this sector. The Akosombo tilapia strain, which has been a success in Ghana, now needs to be upgraded. There is need for continuous research into fish breeding to ensure that the sector has quality fish seed with good growth performance, disease resistance, and tolerance to a wide range of temperature fluctuations. New culturable species are also needed to increase variety and keep the industry vibrant.

Considering the risk associated with culturing fish, assisting farmers to engage and explore tailored insurance schemes is crucial.

Diseases are a major setback for the aquaculture, and more broadly, for the fisheries sector. However, it is important to understand such diseases within the larger purview of fish and human disease interactions to develop holistic solutions for addressing fish diseases.

Cross sectoral policy harmonization is a major concern to ensure that, for instance, the aquaculture policies are aligned with the customs and import regulations for keeping feeds cost affordable because feed accounts for more than two-thirds of the input cost for the aquaculture farmers. Smart subsidies to enhance local quality fish feeds production in partnership with the Fisheries Commission and CSIR WRI might be a potential long-term solution in light of the government prioritizing aquaculture production. Small-scale fisheries benefit through discounted fuel costs under the National Premix Fuel Committee Regulations (L.I. 2233) despite the persistent fish decline in the marine sector. Special targeted subsidies could be planned within the aquaculture sector. These would require to be critically evaluated to safeguard against further distortions within the broader market and negative impacts on the resource base.
Aquaculture should offer an opportunity for increasing opportunities for women, youths and other marginalized communities in line with Sustainable Development Goal 5. The Government of Ghana has identified this gap as part of AfJ. However, for more informed gender inclusion, evidence of gender barriers needs to be provided for women, youths and other vulnerable communities to generate benefits from technical aquaculture innovations. Unlocking such identified barriers will ensure that the technical solutions are grounded within the social context where the innovations are being introduced. Such an approach will avail more sustainable aquatic investment solutions.
Disconnect Between Policy and Implementation
Multiple Use Systems
Multiple Use Systems which are holistic need to be incorporated for more efficient and productive aquaculture sector. Existing policies tend to be largely sector-specific. It is interesting to note that under the 1V1D initiative, the main thrust was on domestic water supply, livestock watering and crop irrigation with no considerations for aquaculture. With more than 300 additional small water reservoirs constructed in the northern regions of Ghana under the initiative, it could have offered opportunity for other uses such as aquaculture. The next phase of the 1V1D initiative should consider incorporating aquaculture in its design and implementation. This will allow future dams to ensure suitability for aquaculture production. It can increase the basket of benefits coming from small water infrastructure and will also contribute toward further improvements in nutrition and financial income streams, particularly in northern Ghana where access to fish is limited.
One of the confounding challenges in Ghana, and sub- Saharan Africa at large, is the large number of policy instruments which have been developed but remain unimplemented. While policies are important, they are not sufficient to bring about on-ground transformation of men, women and youths. A number of reasons have been offered, of which one is the lack of financial resources to implement the mandate that the law provides. Within the broader fisheries sector in Ghana, the enforcement of marine fisheries permit system is an example. This has not been very effective due to limited capacity and resources to patrol the Ghanaian waters. Feed costs are a major expenditure within the aquaculture sector, covering more than 70 percent of the total production cost. However, not enough funds have been invested to ensure that Ghana’s fish feed requirements are produced locally and reduce the impact on foreign exchange demands and price volatility risk on aquaculture farmers. Other reasons provided at the sub-Saharan level are that policy initiatives are sometimes inspired from the international level; there may be insufficient capability and willingness to enforce them at national level.
Innovative Financing Models for Aquaculture
Quality Fingerling Production and High Feed Cost
The Government of Ghana developed a number of programmes, including the AfJ. The success of the programmes hinges on the availability of private sector financing, especially in light of limited state resources. It is, therefore, important to ensure that the programmes
Productivity of aquaculture is impacted by the quality of the fingerlings that the farmers are able to access as well as the high cost of fish feed. In Ghana, fingerling production will not be able to cater to the projected increase in aquaculture production. Plans to increase

both public and private quality fingerling production — located strategically across different parts of the country — are thus vital. The role of the private sector needs to be promoted because the share for fingerling production by the private sector has ballooned from 1 percent to 90 percent (Abban et al., 2009). Similarly, the private sector and farmers should be trained and assisted in quality local feed production to reduce the high input cost. While increased fingerling production and local feed production are welcome, the regulatory role of the state must be further enhanced to guarantee compliance with standards and good practices which might end up being compromised in pursuit of profits. The recently held aquaculture conference from 26 to 27 April 2023, revealed that some ongoing fish vaccination activities could only muster limited engagement of the state.
Conclusion
This technical brief has outlined some of the broader issues on fisheries, and more specifically on aquaculture in Ghana. Aquaculture can significantly contribute to offsetting the declining rate of marine and inland capture fisheries. Beyond good policies, practical implementation strategies and resources are necessary for the effectiveness of fisheries and aquaculture policies in Ghana. This calls for a strategic policy and practice reflection to secure the promotion of individual and collective action for enhancing aquaculture production. Encouraging multiple use systems under the 1V1D programme and the AfJ will offer nutrition, employment and income opportunities for women, youths and other vulnerable members of the community. Policy harmonization and sustainable financing mechanisms will also ensure the sustainability of the project.

CGIAR Initiative on Aquatic Foods
The CGIAR Initiative on Aquatic Foods aims to tackle systemic challenges to the sustainability and resilience of aquatic food systems, including data gaps that lead to exclusion of the sector from wider food and nutrition policies and programs, and limited research investment. Working closely with research partners in fisheries and aquaculture, civil society, industry, and governments, the Initiative contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of aquatic foods and enhances ecological and social resilience through the development and dissemination of improved fish strains, better management practices, integrated fish-rice production systems and fish-friendly irrigation systems.

1. Project scope
The Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT, in its commitment to food security, climate change adaptation, and the sustainability of natural resources, has joined efforts with the Global Crop Trust and the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) to explore the potential of accessions available in germplasm banks. These banks report accession data through the global platform Genesys PGR, which aims to facilitate access to germplasm collection data, promoting its conservation and sustainable use. As a result of this collaboration, two functional tools have been developed: Subsetting and Analogues, along with a beta version of subsets based on TRAITS (genotypic and phenotypic traits).
As mentioned earlier, there are two functional tools called Subsetting and Analogues Tools, which use agroclimatic indicators and soil information as inputs. These inputs allow for the characterization, grouping, and recommendation of accessions, considering the agroclimatic and soil conditions of the locations where the accessions were collected.
The agroclimatic indicators focus on detecting different abiotic stresses, while the soil indicators characterize the various types of soil in each region. The goal is to conduct an analysis that combines this information with phenotypic and genotypic traits of germplasm accessions to generate subsets. To this end, the team has focused this year on developing a beta version specifically for generating subsets based on the TRAITS information available in Genesys, with the long-term goal of integrating this data with agroclimatic indicators and soil properties.
1.1 Objective of the document
This document presents the methodologies, architectures, and the report of a training workshop on the tools: Subsetting, Analogues, and Subset Traits, with the aim of providing an account of the activities carried out this year (2024) for the development and improvement of the tools.
1.2 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop tools that assist in exploring the potential of accessions stored in various germplasm banks around the world. The aim is to support curators in decision-making when recommending accessions for planting in variable locations with changing climatic conditions and a continuously growing accession database. Additionally, the tools enable external users to request materials of interest from different germplasm banks and, most importantly, provide access to materials that could potentially perform well in locations where they had not been previously tested.
2. Subsetting tool
The Subsetting tool is a tool that allows the creation of subsets of accessions belonging to the same crop, based on the climatic and soil conditions of the locations where they were collected. To achieve this, the tool relies on three types of information for its analyses:
• Climatic indicators: These are measures used to analyze the climatic conditions of a region (heat stress, drought, flooding, and photoperiod). This type of data is referred to as a time series since the measures are calculated from daily data, aggregated to a monthly scale, over a period from 1983 to 2016.
Indicator Name Acronym Description Total precipitation TR Total monthly precipitation Consecutive dry days CDD Maximum number of consecutive days with precipitation less than 1 (mm). Number of days with water stress NDWS Number of soil moisture stress days Extreme daily precipitation P95D 95th percentile of precipitation per month Number of days with waterlogging NDWL Number of days with soil waterlogging at moisture content 50% between field capacity and saturation. Average Minimum Temperature TN Monthly average of minimum temperature Average Maximum Temperature TX Monthly average of monthly maximum temperature Average VPD VPD Monthly average of vapor pressure deficit Number of days with high VPD NVPD4 Number of days per month for which the vapor pressure deficit is greater than or equal to 4 kPa Average Solar Radiation Srad Monthly average of solar radiation Julian Day Length DL Monthly average of daylight hours Units mm days days mm days °C °C kPa days W/m2 hours
Table 1: Climate indicators
• Crop-specific climatic indicators: These are measures used to analyze the temperature conditions to which accessions of 14 prioritized crops are exposed. These indicators are also considered time series since they are calculated using the same time frame and inputs as the climatic indicators. For their calculation, crop-specific thresholds are applied to identify heat and cold stress conditions, as well as temperatures considered optimal for crop development.
Indicator Name Acronym Description Number of days with high NDHT Number of days per month in which the maximum temperature temperatures exceeds the maximum temperature supported by the crop. Number of days with low NDLT Number of days per month in which the minimum temperature is temperatures below the minimum temperature supported by the crop. Number of days with water stress NDOT Number of days with optimal temperatures: Number of days per month in which the average temperature oscillates between the optimal temperatures for crop growth Units days days days

• Extracted value indicators: These are called extracted values because they are considered invariant over time.
Indicator Name Acronym Description Units Bulk density BD Bulk density averaged over the top 60 cm of soil Cg/cm3 Cation exchange capacity CEC Average cation exchange capacity over the top 60 cm of soil mmol(c)/kg Soil texture type ST Qualitative variable indicating soil classes taken from the USDA soil classes taxonomy Organic carbon content OCC Organic carbon content averaged over the top 60 cm of soil dg/kg pH PH Soil pH averaged over the top 60 cm of soil pH * 10 Salinity Salinity Qualitative variable indicating soil salinity class classes Table 4: Soil indicators
The Genesys database is constantly growing as germplasm banks continually report or update accession information. One of the main limitations of this project is the inability to obtain in situ climate station data for all accessions. Additionally, the data used must have complete global coverage. Therefore, the project relies on climate products that combine information from climate models and weather station observations to generate spatial data at a resolution of 5 km, available worldwide in raster format. Examples of such data sources include CHIRPS for precipitation, CHIRTS for temperature, AgMerra for solar radiation, and SoilGrids, USDA, and FAO for soil property information.
Once the climatic indicators are calculated and the soil property information is extracted, the next step is to integrate this data with the passport information of the accessions. This integration is achieved using the geographic coordinates of the accessions, meaning the tool only considers accessions with available geographic information (longitude and latitude). After assigning climatic and soil information to the accessions, subsets are constructed using various cluster analysis methodologies. Regardless of the clustering methodology employed, the input for this analysis is a distance matrix derived from climatic and soil indicators.
The tool is designed for users to apply different passport filters of interest, then select the indicators and the time period they want to use for the analysis. A clustering method is applied on the fly, so the following considerations must be considered:
• The user selects only climatic indicators: If the user selects climatic indicators, it must be noted that these are time series. Therefore, to calculate the distance matrix, the Dynamic Time Warping Distance methodology is applied. This distance metric is specifically designed for time series and is particularly useful when the series are temporally misaligned or have different rates (e.g., varying growth or decay speeds).
• The user selects only soil indicators: If the user selects soil indicators, it must be noted that this category includes both quantitative and qualitative variables. Therefore, to calculate a distance matrix, the Gower distance for mixed data should be used. This is a versatile dissimilarity metric, normalized to a specific range, and it allows the incorporation of weights to prioritize certain variables.
• The user selects both climatic and soil indicators: In this case, to calculate the distance matrix, the two techniques mentioned previously are used for each type of data. Then, a linear combination of the separately obtained distances is performed to generate the final distance matrix.
Once the distance matrix is obtained from all user selections, a clustering method is applied from the three available options in the tool. These methods depend on the usage mode, as the tool has two modes: Basic mode and Advanced mode. In Basic mode, a classical statistical clustering method called hierarchical clustering is used, which analyzes the distance between individuals. In Advanced mode, there are two methodologies: the DBSCAN method, which is based on the density of points and has the advantage of detecting outliers—points that are not represented by any formed cluster—and a second method called HBDSCAN, which follows the density methodology but considers the possibility of having multiple densities within the same analysis.
Once the accession groups are defined, the tool offers various visualizations such as graphs, tables, and texts that allow the user to interpret each of the formed groups. The user can then select a group of accessions of interest, considering the climate and soil conditions of the location where they were collected, which we refer to as the resulting subset. If this resulting subset consists of fewer than 50 accessions, it may be called a candidate or final subset. Conversely, if the resulting subset contains more than 50 germplasm accessions, a reduction of this subset is carried out using three methods to obtain the candidate or final subset.
• Random selection: Performs a simple random sampling of the accessions from the resulting subset to obtain a candidate subset.
• Manual selection: The user, based on their experience and knowledge of the names or scientific codes of the
accessions, can manually select the candidate subset.
• Core Collection: Selects the most representative accessions from the resulting dataset. To obtain these accessions, a dimensionality reduction analysis is applied, followed by a cluster analysis. The accessions that most contribute to the formation of the clusters are recommended as the core collection.
Once the candidate subset is obtained, the tool generates a list of accessions of interest, which can then be requested from the germplasm banks where they are available.
As mentioned earlier, the Subsetting Tool has two modes of use: Basic Mode and Advanced Mode. The purpose of both modes is to create subsets of accessions, but the difference lies in the fact that in Advanced Mode, the user can select the months of the year in which they wish to perform the analysis, as well as build different climate scenarios, allowing them to filter accessions based on different ranges of precipitation, temperature, etc. This is done to refine the analyses and make the subset formation more precise. With a focus on improving the accuracy of cluster formation, the Advanced Mode also offers different clustering methods that enhance the results of the grouping process, as these methods are based on the density of the data points.
During this year, the team has made efforts to improve the visualization of indicators in advanced mode, with the new visualizations being easier for users to use. Additionally, new graphs have been included that allow for comparisons of soil property variables across the different formed clusters. Finally, constant support has been provided to users when they have questions about the tool's functionality, as well as fixing bugs when testing the tool with crops it had not been tested with before.
2.1 Representation of architecture
This section describes the system from different perspectives and levels, which allows for a better understanding by the different stakeholders. Each level describes how the system is designed, what it is composed of and how these components interact. The diagrams shown in this document are designed in UML.
As mentioned above, the system is described in levels. Level 1 shows the context of the system, it allows to see the general overview of the system, it does not have many details and focuses on the actors and their interactions with the system. Level 2 describes the system containers. Level 3 describes the components of each of the tool's containers.
2.1.1 Level 1
The Subsetting system is a tool within the Genesys ecosystem that was designed to allow users to create scenarios of abiotic factors and search for accessions that can grow under these conditions. The tool exclusively considers accessions that have georeferencing data, such as the coordinates of their collection sites.
The system provides functionalities to filter accessions by passport data, define agroclimatic scenarios through specific indicators and generate subsets of accessions that meet the selected conditions. Users can visualize the results through graphs, maps and statistical tables.
Users:
• Researchers/Breeders /users with ICT skills: access the Genesys frontend to configure scenarios and query results.
Systems:
• Subsetting System: Processes requests, accesses indicator data in MongoDB and queries accesses through the Genesys API.
• Genesys API: Provides detailed information about accessions, including passport data, taxonomy, collection data and other metadata. Integrates with the Subsetting tool to cross-reference agroclimatic scenarios with accession information.
Data Sources
Indicatorsdb (MongoDB): Stores the agroclimatic indicators calculated for each cell identifier (cellids).
• Accessions Database: Contains the genetic and passport information of the accessions used in the Genesys platform, serving as a central repository of accession data.

2.1.2 Level 2
The Subsetting system is composed of several containers, each with specific functions within the system. The main containers are Frontend Genesys, API Subsetting and Indicators Database (MongoDB).
The Frontend Genesys container is a web application developed with React.js and TypeScript. This container is responsible for providing the user interface of the system and allowing users to interact with the Subsetting tool. Through this interface, users can:
• Filter accessions according to passport data such as georeferencing, biological status, date of collection, among others.
• Define agroclimatic scenarios by selecting specific indicators.
• Visualize results through graphs, maps and statistical tables.
The Genesys Frontend interacts with the Subsetting API to process requests and obtain results, and also connects directly to the Genesys API to access detailed information about the accessions.
The API Subsetting container is a web API developed in Python. It is the core of the system, in charge of processing frontend requests and handling operations related to indicators. Its main responsibilities include:
• Query indicator data stored in the MongoDB database.
• Generate subsets of accessions based on indicators selected by users.
• Return processed results to the Genesys Frontend for visualization.
The Indicators Database (MongoDB) container is a NoSQL database that stores the agroclimatic indicators calculated for each cell identifier (cellid). The stored data includes information about the indicators, their measurement periods, as well as references to crops and categories. The Subsetting API accesses this database through specific queries to retrieve the data needed for the generation of subsets.

2.1.3 Level 3
The Genesys Frontend consists of several main components that allow users to interact with the system. The Passport Data Filter allows applying initial filters on the accessions (country of origin, biological status, date of collection, etc.) this connects directly to the Genesys API to obtain filtered information on the accessions. The Indicator Selector allows the user to select relevant indicators according to the desired climatic conditions. It sends the selections to the Subsetting API to process the data and finally the Results Viewer that displays graphs, statistical tables and maps with the results of the generated subsets, it consumes the data processed by the Subsetting API.
The Subsetting API container manages system requests and calculations, allowing to retrieve minimum, maximum, distributions and proportions for agroclimatic indicators, generate subsets of accessions based on filters applied to indicators, periods and cellids, perform cluster analysis to group cellids according to indicator similarities, and create representative collections of accessions based on the selected data.

3. Analogues tool
Analogues Tool is a tool that allows users to provide a coordinate of interest, select climatic and/or soil indicators, and obtain accessions of a previously specified crop that could potentially develop well at that location. To achieve this, a methodology is proposed that bases its analysis on the climatic and soil indicators outlined in Section 2 of Subsetting Tools (Table 1) and (Table 3). In addition, it is proposed to include climate change scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), with this project evaluating two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs):
• SSP2-4.5 (Optimistic pathway): Represents an intermediate future in terms of socioeconomic development, with moderate economic growth and continued demographic and technological trends.
• SSP5-8.5 (Pessimistic pathway): Represents a future with high economic growth, a rapidly increasing population, and accelerated technological development, but with a lack of significant efforts to mitigate climate change.
Within these climate scenarios, the following 5 models (GCMs) are considered: ACCESS-ESM1-5, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, EC- Earth3, INM-CM5-0, MRI-ESM2-0, which have been selected from a wide variety of models due to their low sensitivity to extreme changes in the trajectories. These data have an approximate resolution of 125 km, so it is necessary to apply downscaling and bias correction techniques. For this, the methodology developed by Navarro-Racines et al. (2020) is considered, which proposes the following method called Delta.
𝐷𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝 = 𝐹𝑢𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 − 𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑐 (1)
(2)
𝐷𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐 = 𝐹𝑢𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 −𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑐 𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑐
Where ""Future"" and ""Historical"" refer to the data from high-resolution models (125 km) calculated for two time periods: 2021–2040 and 2041–2060. In this way, twelve deltas per year are obtained, which are added to the daily CHIRPS (precipitation) and CHIRTS (temperature) data from 1995 to 2014, thus obtaining base data to calculate the following climatic indicators:
Indicator Name Acronym Description Total precipitation TR Total monthly precipitation Consecutive dry days CDD Maximum number of consecutive days with precipitation less than 1 (mm). Number of days with water stress NDWS Number of soil moisture stress days Extreme daily precipitation P95D 95th percentile of precipitation per month Number of days with waterlogging NDWL Number of days with soil waterlogging at moisture content 50% between field capacity and saturation. Average Minimum Temperature TN Monthly average of minimum temperature Average Maximum Temperature TX Monthly average of monthly maximum temperature Average VPD VPD Monthly average of vapor pressure deficit Number of days with high VPD NVPD4 Number of days per month for which the vapor pressure deficit is greater than or equal to 4 kPa Average Solar Radiation Srad Monthly average of solar radiation Julian Day Length DL Monthly average of daylight hours Units mm days days mm days °C °C kPa days W/m2 hours
Table 5: Climate indicators
Once the indicators are calculated, a methodology based on distances is proposed, where the user selects a coordinate of interest and then selects a temporal comparison based on the following scenarios:
• If the user is interested in obtaining accessions that could potentially perform well in the coordinate of interest for current planting, the comparison made is: Historical vs Historical.
• If the user is interested in crop improvement, the focus shifts to the future, so the comparison would be: Historical vs Future (considering the SSPs and time periods of the 2030s and 2050s).
• There are other comparisons: Future vs Future and Future vs Historical. While there are no specific use cases for these, the comparison could still be useful depending on the user's needs.
Then, the indicators for which the analysis is to be performed are selected, and in this selection, the following scenarios need to be established, as the distance calculations are done on the fly.
• The user selects only climate indicators: If the user selects climate indicators, it must be considered that these are time series. Therefore, to calculate the distance and recommend accessions that grow in similar climatic conditions to the reference coordinate, the Dynamic Time Warping Distance methodology is used. This is a distance specifically for time series and is very useful when the series are temporally misaligned or have different rates (e.g., varying growth or decline speeds).
• The user selects only soil indicators: If the user selects only soil indicators, it should be considered that within this category there are both quantitative and qualitative variables. To calculate the distance and recommend accessions that grow in soil conditions like the reference coordinate, the Gower distance for mixed data is used. This is a versatile dissimilarity metric with normalized range.
• The user selects both climate and soil indicators: In this case, the Dynamic Time Warping Distance is used for climate indicators, and the Gower distance for mixed data is used for soil variables. Then, a linear combination of both distances is performed to obtain an overall distance indicator.
Finally, a set of recommended accessions is obtained, which can be requested from the different germplasm banks where they are available.
This year, the team's effort has focused on calculating climate indicators, as the bias correction and downscaling methodology followed by Navarro-Racines et al. (2020) was adopted. It was necessary to recalculate the indicators for each SSP (SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5), for two time periods (2021-2040 and 2041-2060), and for the 5 selected models.

3.1.2 Level 2
The Analogues Tool system is composed of three main containers, each with specific responsibilities. Genesys Frontend is the interface through which users interact with the tool. It allows:
• Enter the location of interest using geographic coordinates.
• Define time periods and climate change scenarios (current or future)
• Select agroclimatic and soil indicators.
• Visualize results and consult recommended accessions.
Subsetting API contains the system logic and is responsible for processing frontend requests, performing calculations and querying the indicator database. Among its main functionalities are:
• Comparison of historical and future conditions using methods such as Dynamic Time Warping Distance (climate indicators) and Gower Distance (soil indicators).
• Management of climate scenarios and access to indicator data.
Indicators Database (MongoDB) stores agroclimatic and soil indicator data. It includes historical and projected information for the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 climate scenarios, calculated for the periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060. It provides the necessary data for the comparisons and calculations made by the API.

1. Project scope
The Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT, in its commitment to food security, climate change adaptation, and the sustainability of natural resources, has joined efforts with the Global Crop Trust and the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) to explore the potential of accessions available in germplasm banks. These banks report accession data through the global platform Genesys PGR, which aims to facilitate access to germplasm collection data, promoting its conservation and sustainable use. As a result of this collaboration, two functional tools have been developed: Subsetting and Analogues, along with a beta version of subsets based on TRAITS (genotypic and phenotypic traits).
As mentioned earlier, there are two functional tools called Subsetting and Analogues Tools, which use agroclimatic indicators and soil information as inputs. These inputs allow for the characterization, grouping, and recommendation of accessions, considering the agroclimatic and soil conditions of the locations where the accessions were collected.
The agroclimatic indicators focus on detecting different abiotic stresses, while the soil indicators characterize the various types of soil in each region. The goal is to conduct an analysis that combines this information with phenotypic and genotypic traits of germplasm accessions to generate subsets. To this end, the team has focused this year on developing a beta version specifically for generating subsets based on the TRAITS information available in Genesys, with the long-term goal of integrating this data with agroclimatic indicators and soil properties.
1.1 Objective of the document
This document presents the methodologies, architectures, and the report of a training workshop on the tools: Subsetting, Analogues, and Subset Traits, with the aim of providing an account of the activities carried out this year (2024) for the development and improvement of the tools.
1.2 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop tools that assist in exploring the potential of accessions stored in various germplasm banks around the world. The aim is to support curators in decision-making when recommending accessions for planting in variable locations with changing climatic conditions and a continuously growing accession database. Additionally, the tools enable external users to request materials of interest from different germplasm banks and, most importantly, provide access to materials that could potentially perform well in locations where they had not been previously tested.
2. Subsetting tool
The Subsetting tool is a tool that allows the creation of subsets of accessions belonging to the same crop, based on the climatic and soil conditions of the locations where they were collected. To achieve this, the tool relies on three types of information for its analyses:
• Climatic indicators: These are measures used to analyze the climatic conditions of a region (heat stress, drought, flooding, and photoperiod). This type of data is referred to as a time series since the measures are calculated from daily data, aggregated to a monthly scale, over a period from 1983 to 2016.
Indicator Name Acronym Description Total precipitation TR Total monthly precipitation Consecutive dry days CDD Maximum number of consecutive days with precipitation less than 1 (mm). Number of days with water stress NDWS Number of soil moisture stress days Extreme daily precipitation P95D 95th percentile of precipitation per month Number of days with waterlogging NDWL Number of days with soil waterlogging at moisture content 50% between field capacity and saturation. Average Minimum Temperature TN Monthly average of minimum temperature Average Maximum Temperature TX Monthly average of monthly maximum temperature Average VPD VPD Monthly average of vapor pressure deficit Number of days with high VPD NVPD4 Number of days per month for which the vapor pressure deficit is greater than or equal to 4 kPa Average Solar Radiation Srad Monthly average of solar radiation Julian Day Length DL Monthly average of daylight hours Units mm days days mm days °C °C kPa days W/m2 hours
Table 1: Climate indicators
• Crop-specific climatic indicators: These are measures used to analyze the temperature conditions to which accessions of 14 prioritized crops are exposed. These indicators are also considered time series since they are calculated using the same time frame and inputs as the climatic indicators. For their calculation, crop-specific thresholds are applied to identify heat and cold stress conditions, as well as temperatures considered optimal for crop development.
Indicator Name Acronym Description Number of days with high NDHT Number of days per month in which the maximum temperature temperatures exceeds the maximum temperature supported by the crop. Number of days with low NDLT Number of days per month in which the minimum temperature is temperatures below the minimum temperature supported by the crop. Number of days with water stress NDOT Number of days with optimal temperatures: Number of days per month in which the average temperature oscillates between the optimal temperatures for crop growth Units days days days

Table 3: Prioritized crop thresholds
• Extracted value indicators: These are called extracted values because they are considered invariant over time.
Indicator Name Acronym Description Units Bulk density BD Bulk density averaged over the top 60 cm of soil Cg/cm3 Cation exchange capacity CEC Average cation exchange capacity over the top 60 cm of soil mmol(c)/kg Soil texture type ST Qualitative variable indicating soil classes taken from the USDA soil classes taxonomy Organic carbon content OCC Organic carbon content averaged over the top 60 cm of soil dg/kg pH PH Soil pH averaged over the top 60 cm of soil pH * 10 Salinity Salinity Qualitative variable indicating soil salinity class classes Table 4: Soil indicators
The Genesys database is constantly growing as germplasm banks continually report or update accession information. One of the main limitations of this project is the inability to obtain in situ climate station data for all accessions. Additionally, the data used must have complete global coverage. Therefore, the project relies on climate products that combine information from climate models and weather station observations to generate spatial data at a resolution of 5 km, available worldwide in raster format. Examples of such data sources include CHIRPS for precipitation, CHIRTS for temperature, AgMerra for solar radiation, and SoilGrids, USDA, and FAO for soil property information.
Once the climatic indicators are calculated and the soil property information is extracted, the next step is to integrate this data with the passport information of the accessions. This integration is achieved using the geographic coordinates of the accessions, meaning the tool only considers accessions with available geographic information (longitude and latitude). After assigning climatic and soil information to the accessions, subsets are constructed using various cluster analysis methodologies. Regardless of the clustering methodology employed, the input for this analysis is a distance matrix derived from climatic and soil indicators.
The tool is designed for users to apply different passport filters of interest, then select the indicators and the time period they want to use for the analysis. A clustering method is applied on the fly, so the following considerations must be considered:
• The user selects only climatic indicators: If the user selects climatic indicators, it must be noted that these are time series. Therefore, to calculate the distance matrix, the Dynamic Time Warping Distance methodology is applied. This distance metric is specifically designed for time series and is particularly useful when the series are temporally misaligned or have different rates (e.g., varying growth or decay speeds).
• The user selects only soil indicators: If the user selects soil indicators, it must be noted that this category includes both quantitative and qualitative variables. Therefore, to calculate a distance matrix, the Gower distance for mixed data should be used. This is a versatile dissimilarity metric, normalized to a specific range, and it allows the incorporation of weights to prioritize certain variables.
• The user selects both climatic and soil indicators: In this case, to calculate the distance matrix, the two techniques mentioned previously are used for each type of data. Then, a linear combination of the separately obtained distances is performed to generate the final distance matrix.
Once the distance matrix is obtained from all user selections, a clustering method is applied from the three available options in the tool. These methods depend on the usage mode, as the tool has two modes: Basic mode and Advanced mode. In Basic mode, a classical statistical clustering method called hierarchical clustering is used, which analyzes the distance between individuals. In Advanced mode, there are two methodologies: the DBSCAN method, which is based on the density of points and has the advantage of detecting outliers—points that are not represented by any formed cluster—and a second method called HBDSCAN, which follows the density methodology but considers the possibility of having multiple densities within the same analysis.
Once the accession groups are defined, the tool offers various visualizations such as graphs, tables, and texts that allow the user to interpret each of the formed groups. The user can then select a group of accessions of interest, considering the climate and soil conditions of the location where they were collected, which we refer to as the resulting subset. If this resulting subset consists of fewer than 50 accessions, it may be called a candidate or final subset. Conversely, if the resulting subset contains more than 50 germplasm accessions, a reduction of this subset is carried out using three methods to obtain the candidate or final subset.
• Random selection: Performs a simple random sampling of the accessions from the resulting subset to obtain a candidate subset.
• Manual selection: The user, based on their experience and knowledge of the names or scientific codes of the
accessions, can manually select the candidate subset.
• Core Collection: Selects the most representative accessions from the resulting dataset. To obtain these accessions, a dimensionality reduction analysis is applied, followed by a cluster analysis. The accessions that most contribute to the formation of the clusters are recommended as the core collection.
Once the candidate subset is obtained, the tool generates a list of accessions of interest, which can then be requested from the germplasm banks where they are available.
As mentioned earlier, the Subsetting Tool has two modes of use: Basic Mode and Advanced Mode. The purpose of both modes is to create subsets of accessions, but the difference lies in the fact that in Advanced Mode, the user can select the months of the year in which they wish to perform the analysis, as well as build different climate scenarios, allowing them to filter accessions based on different ranges of precipitation, temperature, etc. This is done to refine the analyses and make the subset formation more precise. With a focus on improving the accuracy of cluster formation, the Advanced Mode also offers different clustering methods that enhance the results of the grouping process, as these methods are based on the density of the data points.
During this year, the team has made efforts to improve the visualization of indicators in advanced mode, with the new visualizations being easier for users to use. Additionally, new graphs have been included that allow for comparisons of soil property variables across the different formed clusters. Finally, constant support has been provided to users when they have questions about the tool's functionality, as well as fixing bugs when testing the tool with crops it had not been tested with before.
2.1 Representation of architecture
This section describes the system from different perspectives and levels, which allows for a better understanding by the different stakeholders. Each level describes how the system is designed, what it is composed of and how these components interact. The diagrams shown in this document are designed in UML.
As mentioned above, the system is described in levels. Level 1 shows the context of the system, it allows to see the general overview of the system, it does not have many details and focuses on the actors and their interactions with the system. Level 2 describes the system containers. Level 3 describes the components of each of the tool's containers.

The Subsetting system is a tool within the Genesys ecosystem that was designed to allow users to create scenarios of abiotic factors and search for accessions that can grow under these conditions. The tool exclusively considers accessions that have georeferencing data, such as the coordinates of their collection sites.
The system provides functionalities to filter accessions by passport data, define agroclimatic scenarios through specific indicators and generate subsets of accessions that meet the selected conditions. Users can visualize the results through graphs, maps and statistical tables.
Users:
• Researchers/Breeders /users with ICT skills: access the Genesys frontend to configure scenarios and query results.
Systems:
• Subsetting System: Processes requests, accesses indicator data in MongoDB and queries accesses through the Genesys API.
• Genesys API: Provides detailed information about accessions, including passport data, taxonomy, collection data and other metadata. Integrates with the Subsetting tool to cross-reference agroclimatic scenarios with accession information.
Data Sources
Indicatorsdb (MongoDB): Stores the agroclimatic indicators calculated for each cell identifier (cellids).
• Accessions Database: Contains the genetic and passport information of the accessions used in the Genesys platform, serving as a central repository of accession data.

Figure 1 System context
2.1.2 Level 2
The Subsetting system is composed of several containers, each with specific functions within the system. The main containers are Frontend Genesys, API Subsetting and Indicators Database (MongoDB).
The Frontend Genesys container is a web application developed with React.js and TypeScript. This container is responsible for providing the user interface of the system and allowing users to interact with the Subsetting tool. Through this interface, users can:
• Filter accessions according to passport data such as georeferencing, biological status, date of collection, among others.
• Define agroclimatic scenarios by selecting specific indicators.
• Visualize results through graphs, maps and statistical tables.
The Genesys Frontend interacts with the Subsetting API to process requests and obtain results, and also connects directly to the Genesys API to access detailed information about the accessions.
The API Subsetting container is a web API developed in Python. It is the core of the system, in charge of processing frontend requests and handling operations related to indicators. Its main responsibilities include:
• Query indicator data stored in the MongoDB database.
• Generate subsets of accessions based on indicators selected by users.
• Return processed results to the Genesys Frontend for visualization.
The Indicators Database (MongoDB) container is a NoSQL database that stores the agroclimatic indicators calculated for each cell identifier (cellid). The stored data includes information about the indicators, their measurement periods, as well as references to crops and categories. The Subsetting API accesses this database through specific queries to retrieve the data needed for the generation of subsets.

2.1.3 Level 3
The Genesys Frontend consists of several main components that allow users to interact with the system. The Passport Data Filter allows applying initial filters on the accessions (country of origin, biological status, date of collection, etc.) this connects directly to the Genesys API to obtain filtered information on the accessions. The Indicator Selector allows the user to select relevant indicators according to the desired climatic conditions. It sends the selections to the Subsetting API to process the data and finally the Results Viewer that displays graphs, statistical tables and maps with the results of the generated subsets, it consumes the data processed by the Subsetting API.
The Subsetting API container manages system requests and calculations, allowing to retrieve minimum, maximum, distributions and proportions for agroclimatic indicators, generate subsets of accessions based on filters applied to indicators, periods and cellids, perform cluster analysis to group cellids according to indicator similarities, and create representative collections of accessions based on the selected data.

3. Analogues tool
Analogues Tool is a tool that allows users to provide a coordinate of interest, select climatic and/or soil indicators, and obtain accessions of a previously specified crop that could potentially develop well at that location. To achieve this, a methodology is proposed that bases its analysis on the climatic and soil indicators outlined in Section 2 of Subsetting Tools (Table 1) and (Table 3). In addition, it is proposed to include climate change scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), with this project evaluating two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs):
• SSP2-4.5 (Optimistic pathway): Represents an intermediate future in terms of socioeconomic development, with moderate economic growth and continued demographic and technological trends.
• SSP5-8.5 (Pessimistic pathway): Represents a future with high economic growth, a rapidly increasing population, and accelerated technological development, but with a lack of significant efforts to mitigate climate change.
Within these climate scenarios, the following 5 models (GCMs) are considered: ACCESS-ESM1-5, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, EC- Earth3, INM-CM5-0, MRI-ESM2-0, which have been selected from a wide variety of models due to their low sensitivity to extreme changes in the trajectories. These data have an approximate resolution of 125 km, so it is necessary to apply downscaling and bias correction techniques. For this, the methodology developed by Navarro-Racines et al. (2020) is considered, which proposes the following method called Delta.
𝐷𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝 = 𝐹𝑢𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 − 𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑐 (1)
(2)
𝐷𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐 = 𝐹𝑢𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 −𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑐 𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑐
Where ""Future"" and ""Historical"" refer to the data from high-resolution models (125 km) calculated for two time periods: 2021–2040 and 2041–2060. In this way, twelve deltas per year are obtained, which are added to the daily CHIRPS (precipitation) and CHIRTS (temperature) data from 1995 to 2014, thus obtaining base data to calculate the following climatic indicators:
Indicator Name Acronym Description Total precipitation TR Total monthly precipitation Consecutive dry days CDD Maximum number of consecutive days with precipitation less than 1 (mm). Number of days with water stress NDWS Number of soil moisture stress days Extreme daily precipitation P95D 95th percentile of precipitation per month Number of days with waterlogging NDWL Number of days with soil waterlogging at moisture content 50% between field capacity and saturation. Average Minimum Temperature TN Monthly average of minimum temperature Average Maximum Temperature TX Monthly average of monthly maximum temperature Average VPD VPD Monthly average of vapor pressure deficit Number of days with high VPD NVPD4 Number of days per month for which the vapor pressure deficit is greater than or equal to 4 kPa Average Solar Radiation Srad Monthly average of solar radiation Julian Day Length DL Monthly average of daylight hours Units mm days days mm days °C °C kPa days W/m2 hours
Table 5: Climate indicators
Once the indicators are calculated, a methodology based on distances is proposed, where the user selects a coordinate of interest and then selects a temporal comparison based on the following scenarios:
• If the user is interested in obtaining accessions that could potentially perform well in the coordinate of interest for current planting, the comparison made is: Historical vs Historical.
• If the user is interested in crop improvement, the focus shifts to the future, so the comparison would be: Historical vs Future (considering the SSPs and time periods of the 2030s and 2050s).
• There are other comparisons: Future vs Future and Future vs Historical. While there are no specific use cases for these, the comparison could still be useful depending on the user's needs.
Then, the indicators for which the analysis is to be performed are selected, and in this selection, the following scenarios need to be established, as the distance calculations are done on the fly.
• The user selects only climate indicators: If the user selects climate indicators, it must be considered that these are time series. Therefore, to calculate the distance and recommend accessions that grow in similar climatic conditions to the reference coordinate, the Dynamic Time Warping Distance methodology is used. This is a distance specifically for time series and is very useful when the series are temporally misaligned or have different rates (e.g., varying growth or decline speeds).
• The user selects only soil indicators: If the user selects only soil indicators, it should be considered that within this category there are both quantitative and qualitative variables. To calculate the distance and recommend accessions that grow in soil conditions like the reference coordinate, the Gower distance for mixed data is used. This is a versatile dissimilarity metric with normalized range.
• The user selects both climate and soil indicators: In this case, the Dynamic Time Warping Distance is used for climate indicators, and the Gower distance for mixed data is used for soil variables. Then, a linear combination of both distances is performed to obtain an overall distance indicator.
Finally, a set of recommended accessions is obtained, which can be requested from the different germplasm banks where they are available.
This year, the team's effort has focused on calculating climate indicators, as the bias correction and downscaling methodology followed by Navarro-Racines et al. (2020) was adopted. It was necessary to recalculate the indicators for each SSP (SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5), for two time periods (2021-2040 and 2041-2060), and for the 5 selected models.


3.1 Representation of architecture
3.1.1 Level 1
Analogues Tool is a system designed to identify accessions that can thrive in conditions similar to a user-defined location of interest. The tool uses agroclimatic and soil indicators, as well as climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5), to perform distance-based analyses. It allows comparison of historical and future conditions, and its methodology includes specialized calculations. Users can visualize results through graphs and statistical tables.
Users:
• Researchers/Breeders /users with ICT skills: access the Genesys frontend to define locations, select indicators, and query recommended accessions.
Systems:
• Analogues Tool: Processes requests, accesses indicator data in MongoDB.
• Genesys API: Provides detailed information about accessions, including passport data, taxonomy, collection data and other metadata. Integrates with Analogues tool to cross-reference agroclimatic scenarios with accession information.
Data Sources

Indicatorsdb (MongoDB): Stores the agroclimatic indicators calculated for each cell identifier (cellids).
• Accessions Database: Contains the genetic and passport information of the accessions used in the Genesys platform, serving as a central repository of accession data.

3.1.2 Level 2
The Analogues Tool system is composed of three main containers, each with specific responsibilities. Genesys Frontend is the interface through which users interact with the tool. It allows:
• Enter the location of interest using geographic coordinates.
• Define time periods and climate change scenarios (current or future)
• Select agroclimatic and soil indicators.
• Visualize results and consult recommended accessions.
Subsetting API contains the system logic and is responsible for processing frontend requests, performing calculations and querying the indicator database. Among its main functionalities are:
• Comparison of historical and future conditions using methods such as Dynamic Time Warping Distance (climate indicators) and Gower Distance (soil indicators).
• Management of climate scenarios and access to indicator data.
Indicators Database (MongoDB) stores agroclimatic and soil indicator data. It includes historical and projected information for the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 climate scenarios, calculated for the periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060. It provides the necessary data for the comparisons and calculations made by the API.

Outcome  
The Africa Asia Dairy Genetic Gains (AADGG) Platform, an integrated, centralized, multi-functional, web and Android-based system, is a game changer in the livestock development sector in Nepal. It benefits not only the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MoALD) but also other national institutions by digitalizing information in a centralized national database. The platform's unique features enable the collection, recording, storing, and management of farm/herd, animal performance, and services, supporting dairy production enterprises such as artificial insemination (AI), pregnancy diagnosis (PD), and vaccination and health interventions in a single platform.
As part of the interventions in the dairy sector of Nepal under the CGIAR Initiative on Sustainable Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender Inclusion (SAPLING), the AADGG platform was introduced to the Nepal MoALD. This was to support the integration and management of data on dairy animal performance across different farming systems in Nepal. Subsequently, the data captured will be used to generate information to guide the improvement of dairy productivity. The AADGG platform consists of an Android-based Dairy Data App (which works online/offline mode) to collect individual animal data from different types of farms, a web-based data capture interphase for Large-scale Farms (LSF) to ease the collection of performance information on larger numbers of animals reared on large farms (which runs under the sub-domain https://lsf.moald.gov.np/), and a centralized, integrated, web-based main platform to collate data from several sources for additional synthesis to generate relevant information for feedback to individual dairy producers and other actors in the national dairy sector (which runs under the sub-domain https://aadgg.moald.gov.np/).
Through collaborative engagements between the AADGG team and the MoALD, a national committee was established through the MoALD to steer the process of adopting and monitoring progress with the AADGG platform. The steering committee reviewed the existing policy framework for livestock data capture and the relevant support structures required to enable the adoption of the AADGG platform using this link. The platform has now been deployed in the above-mentioned subdomains under the domain (https://moald.gov.np/) of MoALD on the server provided by the Integrated Data Management Center (https://idmc.gov.np), earlier known as the National Information Technology Center (NITC). The initial use of the platform will be to integrate data collected from different farmers initially involved in the government-led Pedigree and Performance Recording System (PPRS), in addition to collecting data from smallholder dairy farmers in the areas selected for initial activities under the SAPLING program.
Partners
Nepal's adoption of the AADGG platform is a collaborative effort with several partners from the country. These include the MoALD, provincial ministries, the Department of Livestock Services (DLS), the National Livestock Breeding Offices (NLBOs) in Pokhara, Lahan and Nepalgunj, the National Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Centre (NABGRC), local level government, universities, research institutes and international development agencies such as Heifer Nepal. Hosting of the national database is supported by the Integrated Data Management Center (IDMS, https://idmc.gov.np) under the Department of Information Technology (DoIT).
Relevance of the intervention
Any improvements and changes in the livestock sector are hinged on the availability of information and data on animal characteristics and their performance within different production environments. From the collation of on- farm records, national animal databases are built and maintained for ready access to information on existing Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR) in a country. This information is critical for strategic planning, cost-effective development of livestock improvement programs and conservation of threatened AnGR. Livestock recording

systems thus provide a multipurpose technological tool for transforming livestock production, notably in low and middle-income countries (Hoffmann et al., 2011). The implementation of a dairy animal data management system within a country is essential for carrying out a breeding program to improve animal productivity under the existing production systems. In Nepal, the AADGG platform provides an opportunity for MoALD and other agencies/organizations working in the livestock sector to manage, track and monitor livestock activities, performance and productivity electronically across the country.
Evidence
The AADGG platform in Nepal was launched on 13 November 2024, followed by a training of trainers (ToT) for the key national stakeholders. A video capturing the event is accessible on the AADGG Facebook page using this link. The system has been deployed in the government sub-domain under the main domain (https://moald.gov.np/) provided by Nepal’s MoALD. The ministry currently performs the administrative role in the platform. Through the MoALD, one national institution reporting to the ministry will be mandated to continue the implementation and management of the platform. Through the platform, different stakeholders can request access to the data and information it contains by following relevant protocols developed by the MoALD.
Way forward
The national partners trained on the use of the AADGG platform outlined specific activities that they would initiate to support the widespread adoption of the data platform and tools as follows:
o Organize training sessions for their colleagues and data collection teams within their units on using the AADGG mobile and web-based application to input cattle and buffalo data into the platform for the selection of top- performing breeding animals.
o Support the adoption of the AADGG platform as the national database for dairy animals and follow up on the opportunity to integrate the ongoing PPRS program data onto the AADGG platform.
o Contribute to the development of protocols and standards for the certification of improved quality dairy animals to be promoted as ‘seed animals’ for breeding.
o Take an active role in monitoring the quality of data collected on farms and use the information generated to guide decisions related to dairy production in Nepal.
o Facilitate cooperation and coordination among key stakeholders, including national universities and cooperatives, to support the implementation of the animal identification and traceability protocols developed through the collaboration with AADGG.

Technical Report
  
Implementing the Soil Doctors Program in the Attapeu Province, Lao PDR

18-22 November 2024
e wrmcn Sie = Agroecology CGIAR
1. Introduction
In Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) most of the population is living in rural areas depending on agriculture for their livelihoods. Farmers have historically practiced subsistence-based integrated farming, which combines crops, livestock and trees in a complex landscape mosaic. Family farming remains the main agricultural system in Lao PDR and has occupied a central role in the sustainable development of the agricultural sector.
The intensification of conventional agriculture is leading to a simplification of agricultural landscapes, land degradation and biodiversity depletion, and an increase of health risks for farmers and consumers. Agricultural productivity and profitability in Lao PDR are becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change, especially under rain-fed conditions. Sustainably managing soil fertility and soil health while maintaining productivity is a challenge. Agroecological practices have developed in response to these challenges. These practices help addressing critical issues such as soil fertility decrease, biodiversity loss, water scarcity or increasing the constraints on crop and livestock productions; and they have been identified as promising and efficient ways to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and to adapt and mitigate climate change.
The CGIAR initiative on Agroecology under which this activity took place is a transdisciplinary, participatory, and action-oriented approach aimed at enhancing food system resilience, equity, and sustainability. The Initiative aims to develop and scale agroecological innovations for small-scale farmers and other agricultural and food system actors across different socioecological contexts in seven low- and middle- income countries.
The Département of Agriculture and Land Management (DALaM) is responsible for the nationwide development and management of agricultural property. Its primary obligations include conducting research, coordinating with relevant stakeholders the conduction of surveys for effective management and land use planning information, and coordinating with relevant parties the conduction of soil research and other production factors for the purpose of enhancing soil health.
The aim of this activity was to support the agroecology transition at the local level, particularly for the producer in Attapeu province, Lao PDR. DALaM and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), with the support of the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), have proposed to conduct the Soil Doctors Program (SDP) within the Agroecology project with the aim of improving soil health and productivity in Attapeu by collaborating with project partners, delivering land
2
e wrmcn Sie = Agroecology CGIAR
management advice to general farmers, and disseminating the knowledge they have acquired.
This report covers the SDP carried out in Attapeu from November 18 to 22, 2024, which was supported by staff from DALaM and the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Office (PAFO), with the aim that the Soil Doctors will be able to train farmers in their respective villages.
These activities continued the implementation of the Global Soil Doctors Program in Lao PDR, which started in September 2023 as a collaborative effort between DALaM, PAFO, the District Agriculture and Forestry Office (DAFO), FAO Laos, and FAO's Global Soil Partnership1.
Objectives
▪ To create a system of farmer-to-farmer training by enhancing farmers' ability to manage their soils in sustainable ways.
▪ To assist governmental organizations and agencies engaged in field-level agricultural extension.
▪ To support field research based on interactions between the Soil Doctors and partners, including access to demonstration and experimental fields; and
▪ To promote the concept of soil testing prior to recommendations on soil management and agroecological practices.
2. Implementation of the soil doctors program
DALaM facilitated the training based on the educational material developed by FAO which was adjusted by DALaM to fit the Lao context. The implementation of the program followed different steps:
Step 1: Selection of soil doctor candidates (September 2024):
▪ Describing the certification procedure and the Global Soil Doctors program.
▪ Describing the soil doctors' requirements:
Individuals that are 18 years of age or older (no gender limits)
- Those who labor hard and maintain good health in agricultural production
- To be a willing and suitable local soil doctor.
- To own a parcel of agricultural land (farm, garden, etc.) that is at least 0.5–1 hectare in size is required.
- They have consistently created agricultural products that are incredibly effective.
- To obtain approval from the partner (wife/husband) or other family members.
1 https://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/resources/highlights/detail/en/c/1661538/
3
e wrmcn Sie = Agroecology CGIAR
- To possess positive relationships, be united with friends, be talented, actively seek out new experiences and knowledge to apply, and be able to effectively impart knowledge to others.

To becoming really helpful to other farmers without becoming self-centred
- Proficiency in reading, writing, and effective communication with farmers, local partners, and trainers.
▪ In accordance with the aforementioned criteria, we notified the participants by allowing them to volunteer by raising their hands and designating five individuals in total. Following this, participants cast their votes for two individuals to serve as their village representatives to attend the SDP and become a soil doctor.
Step 2: Training of the soil doctors:
o Training session took place at the Nonglom agricultural extension center, which is close to the field for practical session.
o Day 1 (18th November), Opening session:
The opening session was chaired by DDG of PAFO by Mr. Thongsavath Sithichack, He explained the situation of the agriculture system and soil management in Attapeu Province and acknowledged the support by IWMI to give technical assistant in soil improvement and sustainable water management. The major objective and goal of the support is to empower farmers in sustainable land resource management so that farmers can know their land better to utilize it for more effective production and with higher outcomes and can overcome restrictions and help create capacity for farmers. The process of transferring scientific knowledge to farmers, the actual practitioners, still requires resources and staff, but based on the quantity of personnel at the central and local levels, it is still restricted and not adequate to promote knowledge to farmers to keep up with the demands of need to support within province. The training of volunteer soil doctors is another technique that originated in adjacent countries and evolved in many nations through the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) and, like Lao PDR, has had the chance to share and adapt a lot of knowledge to local situations. This effort will also assist in driving the government's agricultural development goal to 2025 and Vision to 2030, specifically the goal of the Attapeu Provincial Rural Development Authority to focus on food security and production for export. The opening was co-chair by Dr. Mark Dubois, country representative of IWMI in Lao PDR who commended the individuals involved in supporting these activities reflecting on the positive impact of integrated soil and water management on both farmers and the broader landscape. By focusing on soil health alongside with water management, projects can significantly enhance agricultural sustainability and productivity.

e wrmcn Sie = Agroecology CGIAR
o Training session:
The training was split into 4 small groups, with 5–6 trainees per trainer. The trainer used the poster to explain different soil related topics, and once the soil doctors fully understand, they were asked to add their own explanations. For two days, the poster session took place in the morning and the hands-on soil exercises took place in the afternoon. On the third day, PowerPoint presentations covered improving soil fertility, figuring out the fertilizer rate, and hand-on compost-making using effective microorganisms (EM). The selected educational materials wre:
o Posters:
- What is soil? (Link): The poster highlights the critical role of soil in environmental health and human life, urging the need for its preservation and sustainable management.
- What is Soil Organic Matter (OM) (Link): this poster is about the identification of the raw material of OM and the main function of OM.
- How to enhance Soil Organic Matter (Link): This poster emphasizes the techniques for enhancing OM in soils.
- How to manage Soil Nutrients (Link): In the poster, the fundamental elements of soil nutrient management are explained, including the impacts of nutrient deficiencies or excesses for plants, as well as the importance of proper management. [Right rate, right source, right time, and right place] are the four R's.
- What is the soil pH? (Link): the poster describes the importance of soil pH (acidity, alkalinity) and how to interpret the pH chart.
o Theoretical presentations:
- Techniques for soil improvement: Showcase of soil improvement approaches that have been applied in crop production system in Lao PDR.
- How to increase rice productivity: explaining how to implement strategies, to help rice farmers to significantly enhance productivity while promoting sustainability and resilience in their farming systems.
- How to make compost: explaining the step of compost making.
- How to calculate mineral fertilizer rate (based on soil analysis data): To learn how to calculate the appropriate fertilizer rate and understanding soil's nutrient needs, the crop requirements, and the nutrient content of the fertilizers.
o Field exercises topics: To guide the soil doctors on measurement practices.
o Organic Matter: Colour observation (Link)
o Root observation (Link)

o Compost and EM making
Step 3: Soil doctors train other farmers (after the training of the soil doctors): In a one-day training, the trainers from DALaM, PAFO, and DAFO were split into four teams to provide support in four villages each day. During the training of other farmers, the soil doctors highlighted the significance of soil, soil fertility (OM), and the ways in which the soil may be improved. With each field activity, there are hands-on demonstrations of how to measure items. The last class involves practice on effective microorganisms (EM) and compost making.
3. Key Result
3.1. Training of soil doctors
Participation of the soil doctors and local staff: Eighteen soil doctors from nine villages, one from the Nonglom Center, one from Samakhixay DAFO, three from Sanamxay DAFO, and two PAFO staff were among the twenty-five trainees who participated in the three-day training session. However, there was a lack of gender equality among the volunteers with men participating twice as much as women. This is because the selection process prioritizes participation and active expression of interest, but most women in the chosen villages exhibit culturally a low expression, resulting in more men chosen by the village than women. The ratio was more balanced among Governmental workers (Figure 1).

Pre- and post-assessments: Pre- and post-assessments are essential for determining the progress of trainees and guaranteeing the effectiveness of teaching. This structured approach will help evaluate participants' knowledge before and after the training and hey contribute to the improvement of educational outcomes and the development of a more personalized learning experience. In the training, we administered pre- and post- assessments for each topic, utilizing a scoring system as follows:
- 0-2.5: Indicates no prior knowledge or understanding
- 0.26-0.5: Reflects a basic understanding
- 0.5-0.75: Represents a moderate understanding
- 0.75-1: Signifies a good understanding
Based on the assessment (Figure 2), we observed the average scores provided by each trainee during the pre-assessment. It was noted that for topics 13 and 15, the majority of participants had no prior knowledge, while some staff from PAFO had previously received training on other topics, which reflected a basic understanding. Following the training, we found that most trainees demonstrated an increase in their knowledge of these topics, particularly indicating a good understanding of topic 14. The scores for the other topics reflected a moderate understanding.

Figure 2: Results of the pre- versus post-assessment
General observations to support the soil doctors were:
- Enhancement of Soil Fertility: It is essential to organize quarterly meetings or workshops aimed at refreshing soil fertility practices.
- Resources for Soil Improvement: Inputs necessary for soil enhancement practices should be identified, including materials for compost production (such as lime and molasses), as well as the incorporation of leguminous cover crops and pulse crops.
- Capacity Building on Relevant Topics: There is a need for capacity building in pertinent areas, including Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and soil and water management.
- Field Visits to other Districts or Provinces: Facilitating field visits to other districts or provinces will provide valuable insights and experiences.
3.2. Soil doctors train farmers.
To help the soil doctors train the farmers in their villages, the trainer team was split up into four groups per day. The initial plan was for one soil doctor to train 15 farmers (30 farmers per village), but the training sessions took place during the Attapeu province's rice harvest, and the number of participants in these villages was eventually lower than anticipated. On the other hand, the average gender ratio was with 48% women and 52% men very good. Farmers came mostly from the Congphaiy and Donpok village, and Donmouang, Tammaluay, Donbakmai, Donsoung, and Inthy. Participants represented the main agricultural labor force in age range of 30 to 55 years (Figure 3).

3.3. Communication
One article about the SDP was published on Facebook under the Attapeu provincial News (see this Link). Another article by DALaM is forthcoming. Some of the lessons learned from a communication perspective were:
- For farmers who lack experience in the presented topics the three-day training is too short.
- Most trainers proposed to organize feedback events where farmers can express their opinion about the training.
- Attendance of farmers could have been higher through better timing (not during the farmer's rice harvest).
4. Recommendation for future SDP implementations
• Refresher courses for the soil doctors are needed, in particular in on-farm soil assessment by employing the soil doctor tool kit.
• Regular visits to monitor and assist the Soil Doctors in training local farmers would help to achieve sustainable impact.
9
WL wove Si? = Agroecology CGIAR
• Monitoring reports are recommended specifying details about the participants in the trainings, list of qualified soil doctors, informational and public communication efforts (online or in person), resources Invested, and plan for follow-ups
• To address particular needs as identified during the training, it should be possible to create extra modules and instructional materials (posters, exercises, guidelines, tutorials).
• Qualified trainers should be enabled and resourced to scale up and replicate the training of Soil Doctors in other Provinces, This could include district-to-district or province-to-province exchange visits.
• Farmers should be categorized depending on their knowledge as for farmers with limited knowledge in the training topics, three days of exposure are not enough.
• Two-way communication should be stronger encouraged to benefit from farmers’ indigenous soil fertility management knowledge2, and to identify gaps where the SDP can add value3.

management advice to general farmers, and disseminating the knowledge they have acquired.
This report covers the SDP carried out in Attapeu from November 18 to 22, 2024, which was supported by staff from DALaM and the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Office (PAFO), with the aim that the Soil Doctors will be able to train farmers in their respective villages.
These activities continued the implementation of the Global Soil Doctors Program in Lao PDR, which started in September 2023 as a collaborative effort between DALaM, PAFO, the District Agriculture and Forestry Office (DAFO), FAO Laos, and FAO's Global Soil Partnership1.
Objectives
▪ To create a system of farmer-to-farmer training by enhancing farmers' ability to manage their soils in sustainable ways.
▪ To assist governmental organizations and agencies engaged in field-level agricultural extension.
▪ To support field research based on interactions between the Soil Doctors and partners, including access to demonstration and experimental fields; and
▪ To promote the concept of soil testing prior to recommendations on soil management and agroecological practices.
2. Implementation of the soil doctors program
DALaM facilitated the training based on the educational material developed by FAO which was adjusted by DALaM to fit the Lao context. The implementation of the program followed different steps:
Step 1: Selection of soil doctor candidates (September 2024):
▪ Describing the certification procedure and the Global Soil Doctors program.
▪ Describing the soil doctors' requirements:
Individuals that are 18 years of age or older (no gender limits)
- Those who labor hard and maintain good health in agricultural production
- To be a willing and suitable local soil doctor.
- To own a parcel of agricultural land (farm, garden, etc.) that is at least 0.5–1 hectare in size is required.
- They have consistently created agricultural products that are incredibly effective.
- To obtain approval from the partner (wife/husband) or other family members.

e wrmcn Sie = Agroecology CGIAR
- To possess positive relationships, be united with friends, be talented, actively seek out new experiences and knowledge to apply, and be able to effectively impart knowledge to others.

To becoming really helpful to other farmers without becoming self-centred
- Proficiency in reading, writing, and effective communication with farmers, local partners, and trainers.
▪ In accordance with the aforementioned criteria, we notified the participants by allowing them to volunteer by raising their hands and designating five individuals in total. Following this, participants cast their votes for two individuals to serve as their village representatives to attend the SDP and become a soil doctor.
Step 2: Training of the soil doctors:
o Training session took place at the Nonglom agricultural extension center, which is close to the field for practical session.
o Day 1 (18th November), Opening session:
The opening session was chaired by DDG of PAFO by Mr. Thongsavath Sithichack, He explained the situation of the agriculture system and soil management in Attapeu Province and acknowledged the support by IWMI to give technical assistant in soil improvement and sustainable water management. The major objective and goal of the support is to empower farmers in sustainable land resource management so that farmers can know their land better to utilize it for more effective production and with higher outcomes and can overcome restrictions and help create capacity for farmers. The process of transferring scientific knowledge to farmers, the actual practitioners, still requires resources and staff, but based on the quantity of personnel at the central and local levels, it is still restricted and not adequate to promote knowledge to farmers to keep up with the demands of need to support within province. The training of volunteer soil doctors is another technique that originated in adjacent countries and evolved in many nations through the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) and, like Lao PDR, has had the chance to share and adapt a lot of knowledge to local situations. This effort will also assist in driving the government's agricultural development goal to 2025 and Vision to 2030, specifically the goal of the Attapeu Provincial Rural Development Authority to focus on food security and production for export. The opening was co-chair by Dr. Mark Dubois, country representative of IWMI in Lao PDR who commended the individuals involved in supporting these activities reflecting on the positive impact of integrated soil and water management on both farmers and the broader landscape. By focusing on soil health alongside with water management, projects can significantly enhance agricultural sustainability and productivity.

o Training session:
The training was split into 4 small groups, with 5–6 trainees per trainer. The trainer used the poster to explain different soil related topics, and once the soil doctors fully understand, they were asked to add their own explanations. For two days, the poster session took place in the morning and the hands-on soil exercises took place in the afternoon. On the third day, PowerPoint presentations covered improving soil fertility, figuring out the fertilizer rate, and hand-on compost-making using effective microorganisms (EM). The selected educational materials wre:
o Posters:
- What is soil? (Link): The poster highlights the critical role of soil in environmental health and human life, urging the need for its preservation and sustainable management.
- What is Soil Organic Matter (OM) (Link): this poster is about the identification of the raw material of OM and the main function of OM.
- How to enhance Soil Organic Matter (Link): This poster emphasizes the techniques for enhancing OM in soils.
- How to manage Soil Nutrients (Link): In the poster, the fundamental elements of soil nutrient management are explained, including the impacts of nutrient deficiencies or excesses for plants, as well as the importance of proper management. [Right rate, right source, right time, and right place] are the four R's.
- What is the soil pH? (Link): the poster describes the importance of soil pH (acidity, alkalinity) and how to interpret the pH chart.
o Theoretical presentations:
- Techniques for soil improvement: Showcase of soil improvement approaches that have been applied in crop production system in Lao PDR.
- How to increase rice productivity: explaining how to implement strategies, to help rice farmers to significantly enhance productivity while promoting sustainability and resilience in their farming systems.
- How to make compost: explaining the step of compost making.
- How to calculate mineral fertilizer rate (based on soil analysis data): To learn how to calculate the appropriate fertilizer rate and understanding soil's nutrient needs, the crop requirements, and the nutrient content of the fertilizers.
o Field exercises topics: To guide the soil doctors on measurement practices.
o Organic Matter: Colour observation (Link)
o Root observation (Link)

Step 3: Soil doctors train other farmers (after the training of the soil doctors): In a one-day training, the trainers from DALaM, PAFO, and DAFO were split into four teams to provide support in four villages each day. During the training of other farmers, the soil doctors highlighted the significance of soil, soil fertility (OM), and the ways in which the soil may be improved. With each field activity, there are hands-on demonstrations of how to measure items. The last class involves practice on effective microorganisms (EM) and compost making.
3. Key Result
3.1. Training of soil doctors
Participation of the soil doctors and local staff: Eighteen soil doctors from nine villages, one from the Nonglom Center, one from Samakhixay DAFO, three from Sanamxay DAFO, and two PAFO staff were among the twenty-five trainees who participated in the three-day training session. However, there was a lack of gender equality among the volunteers with men participating twice as much as women. This is because the selection process prioritizes participation and active expression of interest, but most women in the chosen villages exhibit culturally a low expression, resulting in more men chosen by the village than women. The ratio was more balanced among Governmental workers (Figure 1).

Pre- and post-assessments: Pre- and post-assessments are essential for determining the progress of trainees and guaranteeing the effectiveness of teaching. This structured approach will help evaluate participants' knowledge before and after the training and hey contribute to the improvement of educational outcomes and the development of a more personalized learning experience. In the training, we administered pre- and post- assessments for each topic, utilizing a scoring system as follows:
- 0-2.5: Indicates no prior knowledge or understanding
- 0.26-0.5: Reflects a basic understanding
- 0.5-0.75: Represents a moderate understanding
- 0.75-1: Signifies a good understanding
Based on the assessment (Figure 2), we observed the average scores provided by each trainee during the pre-assessment. It was noted that for topics 13 and 15, the majority of participants had no prior knowledge, while some staff from PAFO had previously received training on other topics, which reflected a basic understanding. Following the training, we found that most trainees demonstrated an increase in their knowledge of these topics, particularly indicating a good understanding of topic 14. The scores for the other topics reflected a moderate understanding.

General observations to support the soil doctors were:
- Enhancement of Soil Fertility: It is essential to organize quarterly meetings or workshops aimed at refreshing soil fertility practices.
- Resources for Soil Improvement: Inputs necessary for soil enhancement practices should be identified, including materials for compost production (such as lime and molasses), as well as the incorporation of leguminous cover crops and pulse crops.
- Capacity Building on Relevant Topics: There is a need for capacity building in pertinent areas, including Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and soil and water management.
- Field Visits to other Districts or Provinces: Facilitating field visits to other districts or provinces will provide valuable insights and experiences.
3.2. Soil doctors train farmers.
To help the soil doctors train the farmers in their villages, the trainer team was split up into four groups per day. The initial plan was for one soil doctor to train 15 farmers (30 farmers per village), but the training sessions took place during the Attapeu province's rice harvest, and the number of participants in these villages was eventually lower than anticipated. On the other hand, the average gender ratio was with 48% women and 52% men very good. Farmers came mostly from the Congphaiy and Donpok village, and Donmouang, Tammaluay, Donbakmai, Donsoung, and Inthy. Participants represented the main agricultural labor force in age range of 30 to 55 years (Figure 3).

3.3. Communication
One article about the SDP was published on Facebook under the Attapeu provincial News (see this Link). Another article by DALaM is forthcoming. Some of the lessons learned from a communication perspective were:
- For farmers who lack experience in the presented topics the three-day training is too short.
- Most trainers proposed to organize feedback events where farmers can express their opinion about the training.
- Attendance of farmers could have been higher through better timing (not during the farmer's rice harvest).
4. Recommendation for future SDP implementations
• Refresher courses for the soil doctors are needed, in particular in on-farm soil assessment by employing the soil doctor tool kit.
• Regular visits to monitor and assist the Soil Doctors in training local farmers would help to achieve sustainable impact.
9
WL wove Si? = Agroecology CGIAR
• Monitoring reports are recommended specifying details about the participants in the trainings, list of qualified soil doctors, informational and public communication efforts (online or in person), resources Invested, and plan for follow-ups
• To address particular needs as identified during the training, it should be possible to create extra modules and instructional materials (posters, exercises, guidelines, tutorials).
• Qualified trainers should be enabled and resourced to scale up and replicate the training of Soil Doctors in other Provinces, This could include district-to-district or province-to-province exchange visits.
• Farmers should be categorized depending on their knowledge as for farmers with limited knowledge in the training topics, three days of exposure are not enough.
• Two-way communication should be stronger encouraged to benefit from farmers’ indigenous soil fertility management knowledge2, and to identify gaps where the SDP can add value3.

1. Introduction
1.1. Contexte de l'initiative
L’agriculture sénégalaise, principalement familiale, extensive et pluviale, joue un rôle crucial dans le développement socioéconomique du pays. Elle représente 17 % du produit intérieur brut (PIB) et fournit 32 % des emplois (FIDA, 2020). Elle repose traditionnellement sur des cultures de rente, telles que l’arachide et le coton, ainsi que sur des cultures vivrières de subsistance, comme le mil, le riz, le sorgho et le maïs. Récemment, la production de fruits et légumes à haute valeur ajoutée (oignon, mangue, pastèque, tomate) a augmenté grâce aux politiques de soutien, notamment celles axées sur la maîtrise de l’eau (FIDA, 2020).
Cependant, l’agriculture sénégalaise est particulièrement vulnérable aux changements climatiques en raison de sa dépendance aux précipitations et à la disponibilité de terres productives, notamment dans le bassin arachidier, situé au centre du pays (Badiane et al., 2000). Cette zone est caractérisée par un climat sahélo-soudanien, marqué par une longue saison sèche et des pluies irrégulières concentrées entre juillet et septembre. Depuis les années 1970, une sécheresse prolongée a contraint l’abandon de certaines cultures à cycle long, comme le coton, le riz et le mil tardif, au profit du mil précoce et de l’arachide (Dalauray, 2017). En outre, la salinisation des sols affecte des départements comme Fatick, impactant négativement l’agriculture (Amar et al., 2024).
Le département de Fatick, situé au Sud du bassin arachidier et limité à l’Ouest par l’océan Atlantique, est une zone à vocation agricole au sens large (agriculture, élevage, agroforesterie, pêche). Fatick se situe entre la zone agropastorale sahélienne et une zone d’agriculture humide, bénéficiant de 600 à 800 mm de précipitations annuelles. Les sols varient entre ferrugineux, hydromorphes, halomorphes et de mangroves. Les ressources en eau incluent des cours d’eau permanents, comme ceux du Sine et du Saloum, et des nappes souterraines. La diversité agricole est grandement influencée par les caractéristiques de son paysage. Le couvert végétal est riche, avec des forêts classées. Fatick a une population qui augmente de 3,5 % par an pour atteindre une très forte densité de 136 habitants/km² (ANSD, 2023).
Dans un contexte de changement climatique, cette forte croissance démographique, combinée aux activités agropastorales, exerce une pression importante sur les ressources productives (forestières et sols), pouvant entrainer une dégradation du milieu. Dans les décennies à venir, en absence de mesure d’adaptation et d’atténuation, le département de Fatick sera confronté à des défis majeurs pour assurer la sécurité alimentaire et améliorer les revenus d'une population en croissance rapide. Il est en effet crucial d'augmenter la production face aux menaces du changement climatique sur les rendements, tout en se concentrant sur une meilleure qualité et diversité des produits sensibles aux principes de l’agroécologie.

Pour relever ces défis, depuis la fin de l'année 2022, les organisations de la société civile (OSC) du département de Fatick se sont activement organisées pour promouvoir la transition agroécologique à travers un mouvement citoyen appelé la Dynamique pour la Transition écologique locale (Dytael-Fatick). Cette nouvelle forme de plateforme locale multi-acteurs dépasse l'implication des acteurs traditionnels tels que les organisations paysannes, les ONG, les membres de la recherche, les collectivités territoriales, les services techniques déconcentrés de l'État et les acteurs privés. Elle fait partie d'une organisation nationale qui promeut l'agroécologie au Sénégal, la Dytaes (Dynamique pour une Transition Agroécologique au Sénégal), créée en 2019.
La Dytael a ainsi fait une analyse prospective pour faire de Fatick un territoire agroécologique à l’horizon 2035. Cette vision sert de boussole pour décliner un plan d’action pour la transition agroécologique. L'objectif général de ce plan est de promouvoir les pratiques agroécologiques pour la résilience agro-environnementale et socio-économique des exploitations familiales du département de Fatick. Pour ce faire, la Dytael développe des actions stratégiques visant à renforcer les plaidoyers en faveur de l’agroécologie. Des actions qui se traduisent par la sensibilisation des autorités administratives et politiques et de la population du département sur la nécessité d'adopter des pratiques agroécologiques, le renforcement des capacités des organisations de producteurs membres de Dytael en agroécologie, la promotion les produits agroécologiques à travers des visites et des foires, et l’encouragement de nouveaux comportements envers la préservation de l'environnement.
L'initiative agroécologique du CGIAR au Sénégal s'inscrit dans ce cadre. La Dytael est ainsi considérée comme un « agroecological Living Landscape » (ALL). La Dyteal est accompagnée dans sa vision pour faire de Fatick un territoire agroécologique grâce à la composante 2 du projet sur l’évaluation des performances de l’agroécologie. Suivant une double entrée exploitation agricole et territoire, l’évaluation de l’agroécologie permet à la Dytael d’avoir une photographie de la situation actuelle en vue de fixer des indicateurs de performance à suivre ou à améliorer permettant de définir un chemin de transition vers l’agroécologie.
1.2. De la vision au plan d'action du living andscaps
Le département de Fatick, à travers la Dytael, aspire à devenir un territoire agroécologique d'ici 2035, selon un modèle de développement inclusif intitulé « Made in Fatick »1. Ce modèle repose sur la diversification des systèmes alimentaires et le développement d'une industrie locale valorisant les produits locaux sous le label « Made in Fatick ». Dans cette vision, l'agroécologie, qui intègre l’agriculture, l’élevage et la foresterie, enrichit les sols de manière efficace et augmente la productivité grâce à l'utilisation d'équipements modernes.
Cette vision a été construite à partir d’un processus en deux phases successives et complémentaires. La première phase, une prospective générale, a permis de concevoir plusieurs scénarios de développement, dont celui intitulé « Made in Fatick », axé sur un
1 Parution du Rapport sur « Territorialisation des futurs de l’agroécologie au (…) - ISRA, Bureau d'analyse macro-économique

développement inclusif et respectueux des principes de l’agroécologie. Pour concrétiser cette vision, une seconde phase de prospective approfondie a été menée2, centrée sur l’agroécologie, afin de définir les leviers d’action et les points d’entrée nécessaires pour engager un développement durable et inclusif du territoire de Fatick à partir d'un plan d'action reposant sur la vision stratégique.
Pour traduire cette vision en action, un chemin de transition agroécologique a été co- construit avec les acteurs de la Dytael en utilisant l’approche de backcasting. Cette approche repose sur deux éléments principaux : les résultats de l'analyse HOLPA, qui fournit un aperçu de la situation actuelle et des repères pour chaque point d'entrée identifié, et le visionning, qui projette vers le futur souhaité avec des points d’entrée précis pour amorcer la transition agroécologique. La co-construction de ce chemin de transition, réalisée lors d’ateliers multi- acteurs réunissant la diversité des parties prenantes de la Dytael, s’est basée sur des allers- retours entre le futur souhaité (défini par le visionning) et la situation actuelle (analysée par HOLPA), permettant ainsi de préciser les étapes nécessaires pour une transition efficace, à la fois au niveau des exploitations agricoles et du territoire dans son ensemble.
Pour rendre cette vision opérationnelle, un soutien spécifique doit être prévu pour les populations vulnérables, et la gouvernance doit être inclusive afin de valoriser le rôle des femmes et des jeunes. Six piliers structurent cette vision, matérialisés sous forme d’indicateurs de performance : (i) l’accès à l’eau et la gestion durable des ressources hydriques, (ii) la restauration des terres dégradées et la résilience climatique, (iii) la gestion durable des ressources forestières et pastorales, (iv) la transition agroécologique avec intégration de l’agriculture et de l’élevage, (v) la valorisation des produits locaux et le développement économique, et (vi) la planification territoriale intégrant l’agroécologie dans les politiques publiques locales (Figure 1).

2.1. Les objectifs de l’évaluation de l’agroécologie dans le département de Fatick
L’évaluation des performances de l’agroécologie est essentielle pour établir un état des lieux sur le niveau de transition agroécologique du territoire et identifier les indicateurs sur lesquelles l’agroécologie, telle que pratiquée à Fatick, est performante et ceux sur lesquels des efforts sont encore à fournir. Les questions de recherche que nous avons identifiées pour cette étude sont les suivantes :
• Quel est le niveau actuel de l’agroécologie à Fatick et celui de l’adhérence à ses principes ?
• Sur quelles dimensions les exploitations “les plus agroécologiques” sont plus ou moins performantes que celles moins « agroécologiques » ?
• Existe-t-il des contraintes et opportunités pour le développement de l’agroécologie au niveau de différents types d’exploitations ? Quelless sont les contraintes à son développement au niveau territorial ?
2.2. Présentation de HOLPA
Afin de produire des données pertinentes au niveau local et comparables au niveau mondial sur l'impact de l'agroécologie, l’Initiative a mis au point le cadre HOLPA (Holistic Localized Performance Assessment). Pour rappel, HOLPA est conçu pour permettre de déterminer quels types de pratiques et d'approches agricoles conduisent à des résultats durables, à différentes échelles et dans différents contextes, tout au long de la chaîne alimentaire. Huit pays sont impliqués dans cette étude (figure 1).
HOLPA est constitué de 3 modules d’enquête, (1) le module contexte, (2) le module niveau d’agroécologisation, (3) le module évaluation des performances de l’agroécologie (figure 3). Les données collectées dans ces modules sont présentées tableau 1, 2 et figure 4.

3. Méthodologie
3.1. Localisation de HOLPA, l’atelier d’identification des indicateurs locaux
Le cadre global d’évaluation HOLPA a été adapté au Sénégal, certains indicateurs ayant été ajoutés grâce à un atelier de localisation avec les acteurs de la Dytael. Cet atelier avait pour but de co-développer avec les parties prenantes de la Dytael, un ensemble d'indicateurs locaux de performance qui soient pertinents et adaptés aux systèmes agricoles de la Dytael. Cet atelier s’est concentré sur la détermination de tels indicateurs à l’échelle de l’exploitation. Plusieurs producteurs (agriculteurs et éleveurs), transformateurs, membres des services techniques agricoles (agriculture et elevage), représentants et élus locaux et organisations telles que les ONG, des membres du comité technique de la Dytael et des chercheurs ont participé à cet atelier.
L’agenda de l’atelier comportait les points clés ci-après :
- Identification des perceptions des acteurs sur les concepts d’agroécologie et de ferme agroécologique,
- Précision du concept d’indicateur et de leur utilité dans le contexte de l’évaluation des performances de l’agroécologie,
Identification de longues listes d’indicateurs locaux en groupe,
- Vote des indicateurs locaux les plus pertinents par les parties prenantes.
L’atelier s’est organisé en “world café” afin de faciliter le dialogue constructif et le partage d’idées. Les participants ont été répartis en quatre groupes, dans les dimensions agro- zootechnique, sociale, économique et environnementale. La composition des groupes a été déterminée de manière à avoir dans chaque groupe une homogénéité de sexe (afin de laisser s’exprimer les femmes) et une hétérogénéité de domaines d’activités et de localités d’origine. Du fait du moindre nombre de femmes, un seul groupe comprenant toutes les femmes a été constitué sur les quatre groupes ; les autres ont été composés avec les hommes. Un animateur, dont le rôle était de faciliter les échanges et de s’assurer que tous les membres du groupe participent, a été attribué à chacun des groupes. De même, chaque dimension a été prise en charge par un (ou deux) expert ayant pour rôle d’expliquer la dimension et de répondre aux questions ou besoins de redirection au cours de la réflexion en groupe.
Le World café s’est déroulé de la manière suivante : initialement les groupes ont chacun été répartis sur une dimension différente, celle-ci leur a été présentée par l’expert et ils ont réfléchi et proposé des indicateurs locaux importants pour cette dimension. Puis, les groupes se sont déplacés vers une autre dimension, et ainsi de suite jusqu’à ce que chaque groupe ait apporté sa contribution sur toutes les dimensions.
A la fin de cette réflexion en world café, toutes les propositions d’indicateurs ont été regroupées et classées en sous-thématiques de dimensions (exemple pour l’environnement : eau, sol, arbres), et les indicateurs identiques ou très similaires aux indicateurs globaux de l’outil HOLPA (soit les indicateurs qu’il est déjà prévu d’évaluer, les KPIs globaux) ont été
11
identifiés et spécifiés. Les indicateurs proposés pour chacune des dimensions ont été présentés en plénière et les parties prenantes sont retournées en groupe pour voter pour sélectionner maximum 3 indicateurs par dimension. A la fin de cette étape, les votes de tous les groupes ont été cumulés permettant de faire ressortir les indicateurs locaux les plus pertinents selon les parties prenantes3 (tableau 3).

3.2. Mise en œuvre de l'outil HOLPA
3.2.1. Méthodologie d’échantillonnage
Nous avons réalisé 200 enquêtes dans le département de Fatick de janvier à avril 2024. Ces enquêtes ont été réalisées par une équipe de 9 enquêteurs et trois superviseurs. Les guidelines de HOLPA demandaient à ce que 160 exploitations sélectionnées montrent des signes d’adhérence forts aux principes de l’agroécologie. Il a été très difficile d’identifier de telles exploitations à priori, nous avons donc procédé à un échantillonnage à partir d’un zonage selon les caractéristiques du milieu et l’accessibilité des exploitations aux routes et centres urbains (Figure 5 et 6).

Les exploitations ont été sélectionnées dans les 6 zonages suivants :
- Exploitations urbaines ou péri-urbaines: exploitations dans des centres urbains, des zones habitées (33%) ;
- Exploitations fortement influencées par les routes : exploitations situées proches des grands axes de circulation. En particulier, le long de l’axe autoroutier (Tattaguine- Fatick-Kaolack) (3%) ;
- Exploitations des vallées fossiles : exploitations situées sur les terrains des vallées fertiles, influençant leurs productions (plus de maraîchage, de vergers, riz) (21%) ;
- Exploitations du Bassin Arachidier (en zone Sérère) : exploitations du bassin arachidier (mil, arachide, élevage…) (25%) ;
13
- Exploitations du milieu rural du sud du département de Fatick : exploitations en zone plus humide avec pêche, mangroves (19%).

3.2.2. Analyse des données HOLPA
Les scores médians de chaque principe de l’agroécologie (voir tableau 2) de l’ensemble de l’échantillon ont été calculés, pour avoir une vision globale du niveau de transition agroécologique sur le territoire. Puis, pour identifier les exploitations les plus “agroécologiques”, et celles “les moins agroécologiques”, nous avons procédé avec la règle suivante : les exploitations avec un score médian total des principes supérieur à 3,3 ont été définies comme « les plus agroécologiques », et celles avec un score médian total inférieur à 2,3, comme « moins agroécologiques ». Les scores sur chaque principe dans ces deux groupes ont été comparés afin d’identifier les principes les moins/plus performants lorsqu’une exploitation était définie comme « plus agroécologique ». Les caractéristiques des exploitations (surface totale, nombre d’UBT, type de culture mis en place) de ces deux groupes ont été comparées, et les pratiques spécifiques mises en place par le groupe « agroécologique » ont été analysées. Enfin, nous avons comparé les performances (KPI et indicateurs locaux) du groupe plus agroécologique avec le groupe moins agroécologique.

4. Résultats de l'enquête HOLPA
Le niveau de l’agroécologie sur le territoire
Sur les 200 exploitations enquêtées, seules 30% affirment avoir une compréhension claire de ce qu’est l’agroécologie (figure 7), même si quasiment la totalité des enquêtés indiquent qu’ils sont d’accord avec le fait que l’agroécologie soit une bonne approche pour gérer les fermes et les systèmes alimentaires. Cela vient probablement de la manière dont agroécologie a été traduit en wolof par les enquêteurs (Mbaay mou sell) qui réfère en Français à une agriculture saine ; la majorité des agriculteurs de la zone pouvant s’y reconnaître, ce terme étant assez général.

1. Introduction
1.1. Contexte de l'initiative
L’agriculture sénégalaise, principalement familiale, extensive et pluviale, joue un rôle crucial dans le développement socioéconomique du pays. Elle représente 17 % du produit intérieur brut (PIB) et fournit 32 % des emplois (FIDA, 2020). Elle repose traditionnellement sur des cultures de rente, telles que l’arachide et le coton, ainsi que sur des cultures vivrières de subsistance, comme le mil, le riz, le sorgho et le maïs. Récemment, la production de fruits et légumes à haute valeur ajoutée (oignon, mangue, pastèque, tomate) a augmenté grâce aux politiques de soutien, notamment celles axées sur la maîtrise de l’eau (FIDA, 2020).
Cependant, l’agriculture sénégalaise est particulièrement vulnérable aux changements climatiques en raison de sa dépendance aux précipitations et à la disponibilité de terres productives, notamment dans le bassin arachidier, situé au centre du pays (Badiane et al., 2000). Cette zone est caractérisée par un climat sahélo-soudanien, marqué par une longue saison sèche et des pluies irrégulières concentrées entre juillet et septembre. Depuis les années 1970, une sécheresse prolongée a contraint l’abandon de certaines cultures à cycle long, comme le coton, le riz et le mil tardif, au profit du mil précoce et de l’arachide (Dalauray, 2017). En outre, la salinisation des sols affecte des départements comme Fatick, impactant négativement l’agriculture (Amar et al., 2024).
Le département de Fatick, situé au Sud du bassin arachidier et limité à l’Ouest par l’océan Atlantique, est une zone à vocation agricole au sens large (agriculture, élevage, agroforesterie, pêche). Fatick se situe entre la zone agropastorale sahélienne et une zone d’agriculture humide, bénéficiant de 600 à 800 mm de précipitations annuelles. Les sols varient entre ferrugineux, hydromorphes, halomorphes et de mangroves. Les ressources en eau incluent des cours d’eau permanents, comme ceux du Sine et du Saloum, et des nappes souterraines. La diversité agricole est grandement influencée par les caractéristiques de son paysage. Le couvert végétal est riche, avec des forêts classées. Fatick a une population qui augmente de 3,5 % par an pour atteindre une très forte densité de 136 habitants/km² (ANSD, 2023).
Dans un contexte de changement climatique, cette forte croissance démographique, combinée aux activités agropastorales, exerce une pression importante sur les ressources productives (forestières et sols), pouvant entrainer une dégradation du milieu. Dans les décennies à venir, en absence de mesure d’adaptation et d’atténuation, le département de Fatick sera confronté à des défis majeurs pour assurer la sécurité alimentaire et améliorer les revenus d'une population en croissance rapide. Il est en effet crucial d'augmenter la production face aux menaces du changement climatique sur les rendements, tout en se concentrant sur une meilleure qualité et diversité des produits sensibles aux principes de l’agroécologie.
3
Pour relever ces défis, depuis la fin de l'année 2022, les organisations de la société civile (OSC) du département de Fatick se sont activement organisées pour promouvoir la transition agroécologique à travers un mouvement citoyen appelé la Dynamique pour la Transition écologique locale (Dytael-Fatick). Cette nouvelle forme de plateforme locale multi-acteurs dépasse l'implication des acteurs traditionnels tels que les organisations paysannes, les ONG, les membres de la recherche, les collectivités territoriales, les services techniques déconcentrés de l'État et les acteurs privés. Elle fait partie d'une organisation nationale qui promeut l'agroécologie au Sénégal, la Dytaes (Dynamique pour une Transition Agroécologique au Sénégal), créée en 2019.
La Dytael a ainsi fait une analyse prospective pour faire de Fatick un territoire agroécologique à l’horizon 2035. Cette vision sert de boussole pour décliner un plan d’action pour la transition agroécologique. L'objectif général de ce plan est de promouvoir les pratiques agroécologiques pour la résilience agro-environnementale et socio-économique des exploitations familiales du département de Fatick. Pour ce faire, la Dytael développe des actions stratégiques visant à renforcer les plaidoyers en faveur de l’agroécologie. Des actions qui se traduisent par la sensibilisation des autorités administratives et politiques et de la population du département sur la nécessité d'adopter des pratiques agroécologiques, le renforcement des capacités des organisations de producteurs membres de Dytael en agroécologie, la promotion les produits agroécologiques à travers des visites et des foires, et l’encouragement de nouveaux comportements envers la préservation de l'environnement.
L'initiative agroécologique du CGIAR au Sénégal s'inscrit dans ce cadre. La Dytael est ainsi considérée comme un « agroecological Living Landscape » (ALL). La Dyteal est accompagnée dans sa vision pour faire de Fatick un territoire agroécologique grâce à la composante 2 du projet sur l’évaluation des performances de l’agroécologie. Suivant une double entrée exploitation agricole et territoire, l’évaluation de l’agroécologie permet à la Dytael d’avoir une photographie de la situation actuelle en vue de fixer des indicateurs de performance à suivre ou à améliorer permettant de définir un chemin de transition vers l’agroécologie.
1.2. De la vision au plan d'action du living andscaps
Le département de Fatick, à travers la Dytael, aspire à devenir un territoire agroécologique d'ici 2035, selon un modèle de développement inclusif intitulé « Made in Fatick »1. Ce modèle repose sur la diversification des systèmes alimentaires et le développement d'une industrie locale valorisant les produits locaux sous le label « Made in Fatick ». Dans cette vision, l'agroécologie, qui intègre l’agriculture, l’élevage et la foresterie, enrichit les sols de manière efficace et augmente la productivité grâce à l'utilisation d'équipements modernes.
Cette vision a été construite à partir d’un processus en deux phases successives et complémentaires. La première phase, une prospective générale, a permis de concevoir plusieurs scénarios de développement, dont celui intitulé « Made in Fatick », axé sur un
1 Parution du Rapport sur « Territorialisation des futurs de l’agroécologie au (…) - ISRA, Bureau d'analyse macro-économique

développement inclusif et respectueux des principes de l’agroécologie. Pour concrétiser cette vision, une seconde phase de prospective approfondie a été menée2, centrée sur l’agroécologie, afin de définir les leviers d’action et les points d’entrée nécessaires pour engager un développement durable et inclusif du territoire de Fatick à partir d'un plan d'action reposant sur la vision stratégique.
Pour traduire cette vision en action, un chemin de transition agroécologique a été co- construit avec les acteurs de la Dytael en utilisant l’approche de backcasting. Cette approche repose sur deux éléments principaux : les résultats de l'analyse HOLPA, qui fournit un aperçu de la situation actuelle et des repères pour chaque point d'entrée identifié, et le visionning, qui projette vers le futur souhaité avec des points d’entrée précis pour amorcer la transition agroécologique. La co-construction de ce chemin de transition, réalisée lors d’ateliers multi- acteurs réunissant la diversité des parties prenantes de la Dytael, s’est basée sur des allers- retours entre le futur souhaité (défini par le visionning) et la situation actuelle (analysée par HOLPA), permettant ainsi de préciser les étapes nécessaires pour une transition efficace, à la fois au niveau des exploitations agricoles et du territoire dans son ensemble.
Pour rendre cette vision opérationnelle, un soutien spécifique doit être prévu pour les populations vulnérables, et la gouvernance doit être inclusive afin de valoriser le rôle des femmes et des jeunes. Six piliers structurent cette vision, matérialisés sous forme d’indicateurs de performance : (i) l’accès à l’eau et la gestion durable des ressources hydriques, (ii) la restauration des terres dégradées et la résilience climatique, (iii) la gestion durable des ressources forestières et pastorales, (iv) la transition agroécologique avec intégration de l’agriculture et de l’élevage, (v) la valorisation des produits locaux et le développement économique, et (vi) la planification territoriale intégrant l’agroécologie dans les politiques publiques locales (Figure 1).

2.1. Les objectifs de l’évaluation de l’agroécologie dans le département de Fatick
L’évaluation des performances de l’agroécologie est essentielle pour établir un état des lieux sur le niveau de transition agroécologique du territoire et identifier les indicateurs sur lesquelles l’agroécologie, telle que pratiquée à Fatick, est performante et ceux sur lesquels des efforts sont encore à fournir. Les questions de recherche que nous avons identifiées pour cette étude sont les suivantes :
• Quel est le niveau actuel de l’agroécologie à Fatick et celui de l’adhérence à ses principes ?
• Sur quelles dimensions les exploitations “les plus agroécologiques” sont plus ou moins performantes que celles moins « agroécologiques » ?
• Existe-t-il des contraintes et opportunités pour le développement de l’agroécologie au niveau de différents types d’exploitations ? Quelless sont les contraintes à son développement au niveau territorial ?
2.2. Présentation de HOLPA
Afin de produire des données pertinentes au niveau local et comparables au niveau mondial sur l'impact de l'agroécologie, l’Initiative a mis au point le cadre HOLPA (Holistic Localized Performance Assessment). Pour rappel, HOLPA est conçu pour permettre de déterminer quels types de pratiques et d'approches agricoles conduisent à des résultats durables, à différentes échelles et dans différents contextes, tout au long de la chaîne alimentaire. Huit pays sont impliqués dans cette étude (figure 1).
HOLPA est constitué de 3 modules d’enquête, (1) le module contexte, (2) le module niveau d’agroécologisation, (3) le module évaluation des performances de l’agroécologie (figure 3). Les données collectées dans ces modules sont présentées tableau 1, 2 et figure 4.

3. Méthodologie
3.1. Localisation de HOLPA, l’atelier d’identification des indicateurs locaux
Le cadre global d’évaluation HOLPA a été adapté au Sénégal, certains indicateurs ayant été ajoutés grâce à un atelier de localisation avec les acteurs de la Dytael. Cet atelier avait pour but de co-développer avec les parties prenantes de la Dytael, un ensemble d'indicateurs locaux de performance qui soient pertinents et adaptés aux systèmes agricoles de la Dytael. Cet atelier s’est concentré sur la détermination de tels indicateurs à l’échelle de l’exploitation. Plusieurs producteurs (agriculteurs et éleveurs), transformateurs, membres des services techniques agricoles (agriculture et elevage), représentants et élus locaux et organisations telles que les ONG, des membres du comité technique de la Dytael et des chercheurs ont participé à cet atelier.
L’agenda de l’atelier comportait les points clés ci-après :
- Identification des perceptions des acteurs sur les concepts d’agroécologie et de ferme agroécologique,
- Précision du concept d’indicateur et de leur utilité dans le contexte de l’évaluation des performances de l’agroécologie,
Identification de longues listes d’indicateurs locaux en groupe,
- Vote des indicateurs locaux les plus pertinents par les parties prenantes.
L’atelier s’est organisé en “world café” afin de faciliter le dialogue constructif et le partage d’idées. Les participants ont été répartis en quatre groupes, dans les dimensions agro- zootechnique, sociale, économique et environnementale. La composition des groupes a été déterminée de manière à avoir dans chaque groupe une homogénéité de sexe (afin de laisser s’exprimer les femmes) et une hétérogénéité de domaines d’activités et de localités d’origine. Du fait du moindre nombre de femmes, un seul groupe comprenant toutes les femmes a été constitué sur les quatre groupes ; les autres ont été composés avec les hommes. Un animateur, dont le rôle était de faciliter les échanges et de s’assurer que tous les membres du groupe participent, a été attribué à chacun des groupes. De même, chaque dimension a été prise en charge par un (ou deux) expert ayant pour rôle d’expliquer la dimension et de répondre aux questions ou besoins de redirection au cours de la réflexion en groupe.
Le World café s’est déroulé de la manière suivante : initialement les groupes ont chacun été répartis sur une dimension différente, celle-ci leur a été présentée par l’expert et ils ont réfléchi et proposé des indicateurs locaux importants pour cette dimension. Puis, les groupes se sont déplacés vers une autre dimension, et ainsi de suite jusqu’à ce que chaque groupe ait apporté sa contribution sur toutes les dimensions.
A la fin de cette réflexion en world café, toutes les propositions d’indicateurs ont été regroupées et classées en sous-thématiques de dimensions (exemple pour l’environnement : eau, sol, arbres), et les indicateurs identiques ou très similaires aux indicateurs globaux de l’outil HOLPA (soit les indicateurs qu’il est déjà prévu d’évaluer, les KPIs globaux) ont été
11
identifiés et spécifiés. Les indicateurs proposés pour chacune des dimensions ont été présentés en plénière et les parties prenantes sont retournées en groupe pour voter pour sélectionner maximum 3 indicateurs par dimension. A la fin de cette étape, les votes de tous les groupes ont été cumulés permettant de faire ressortir les indicateurs locaux les plus pertinents selon les parties prenantes3 (tableau 3).

3.2. Mise en œuvre de l'outil HOLPA
3.2.1. Méthodologie d’échantillonnage
Nous avons réalisé 200 enquêtes dans le département de Fatick de janvier à avril 2024. Ces enquêtes ont été réalisées par une équipe de 9 enquêteurs et trois superviseurs. Les guidelines de HOLPA demandaient à ce que 160 exploitations sélectionnées montrent des signes d’adhérence forts aux principes de l’agroécologie. Il a été très difficile d’identifier de telles exploitations à priori, nous avons donc procédé à un échantillonnage à partir d’un zonage selon les caractéristiques du milieu et l’accessibilité des exploitations aux routes et centres urbains (Figure 5 et 6).

Les exploitations ont été sélectionnées dans les 6 zonages suivants :
- Exploitations urbaines ou péri-urbaines: exploitations dans des centres urbains, des zones habitées (33%) ;
- Exploitations fortement influencées par les routes : exploitations situées proches des grands axes de circulation. En particulier, le long de l’axe autoroutier (Tattaguine- Fatick-Kaolack) (3%) ;
- Exploitations des vallées fossiles : exploitations situées sur les terrains des vallées fertiles, influençant leurs productions (plus de maraîchage, de vergers, riz) (21%) ;
- Exploitations du Bassin Arachidier (en zone Sérère) : exploitations du bassin arachidier (mil, arachide, élevage…) (25%) ;
13
- Exploitations du milieu rural du sud du département de Fatick : exploitations en zone plus humide avec pêche, mangroves (19%).

3.2.2. Analyse des données HOLPA
Les scores médians de chaque principe de l’agroécologie (voir tableau 2) de l’ensemble de l’échantillon ont été calculés, pour avoir une vision globale du niveau de transition agroécologique sur le territoire. Puis, pour identifier les exploitations les plus “agroécologiques”, et celles “les moins agroécologiques”, nous avons procédé avec la règle suivante : les exploitations avec un score médian total des principes supérieur à 3,3 ont été définies comme « les plus agroécologiques », et celles avec un score médian total inférieur à 2,3, comme « moins agroécologiques ». Les scores sur chaque principe dans ces deux groupes ont été comparés afin d’identifier les principes les moins/plus performants lorsqu’une exploitation était définie comme « plus agroécologique ». Les caractéristiques des exploitations (surface totale, nombre d’UBT, type de culture mis en place) de ces deux groupes ont été comparées, et les pratiques spécifiques mises en place par le groupe « agroécologique » ont été analysées. Enfin, nous avons comparé les performances (KPI et indicateurs locaux) du groupe plus agroécologique avec le groupe moins agroécologique.

4. Résultats de l'enquête HOLPA
Le niveau de l’agroécologie sur le territoire
Sur les 200 exploitations enquêtées, seules 30% affirment avoir une compréhension claire de ce qu’est l’agroécologie (figure 7), même si quasiment la totalité des enquêtés indiquent qu’ils sont d’accord avec le fait que l’agroécologie soit une bonne approche pour gérer les fermes et les systèmes alimentaires. Cela vient probablement de la manière dont agroécologie a été traduit en wolof par les enquêteurs (Mbaay mou sell) qui réfère en Français à une agriculture saine ; la majorité des agriculteurs de la zone pouvant s’y reconnaître, ce terme étant assez général.

Abstract
Climate change is expected to impact cacao cultivation in Ecuador, the fifth largest cacao producing country in the world and largest exporter of fine flavour cacao. The objective of this study was to evaluate the future impact of climate change on the suitable distribution of cultivated and wild cacao and identify areas where climate change tolerant genotypes may occur in Ecuador. Using 26,152 presence points for cultivated cacao and 95 presence points for wild cacao, we modelled the present suitability distribution of cultivated and wild cacao and performed future climate projections under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0) and two time periods (2050s and 2070s). For both cul- tivated and wild cacao, we constructed six different ensemble models employing different filtering methods for presence points, we projected each ensemble model to future climatic conditions, and we then built the final maps of present distribution and future projections based on the majority-vote criterion. Our future projections predict a 8–16% contraction and 19–21% expansion of the currently suitable area of cultivated cacao, while wild cacao is expected to maintain most of its suitable area and experience a further 7–12% expansion in the future. Ecogeographical zones are predicted to change in 23-33% of the combined distributions of cultivated and wild cacao. We identified the areas in Ecuador where popu- lations of climate change tolerant genotypes are expected to occur. Interventions to promote adaptation to climate change will be required in cacao cultivation areas that are expected to
be impacted by climate change in Ecuador, including the use of tolerant genotypes.

1 Introduction
Cacao is one of the most important cash crops in Ecuador. Ecuador is the fifth largest cacao producing country in the world (FAOSTAT 2019), with cacao cultivation covering ca. 525,000 ha (FAOSTAT 2019) and providing livelihoods to ca. 120,000 farmers (SENP-
LADES 2019). Cacao production in Ecuador has been steadily increasing over the past

years, rising from less than 200,000 t in the 2010s to 325,000 t in 2019–20 (Fountain and Hütz-Adams 2020). In particular, Ecuador produces the cacao cultivar called ‘Nacional’, which makes it the largest producer of fine flavour cacao, contributing to 63% of the total fine flavour cacao production globally (ANECACAO 2019). Fine flavour cacao is a cacao with attractive sensorial qualities and a special flavour profile, warranting premium prices as compared to bulk cacao which is primarily used for industrial productions (ICCO 2019). Although fine flavour cacao currently amounts to less than 5% of the world market (ICCO 2019), it has been expanding at a rate of 7–11% per year since 2011 (Vignati and Gómez-
García 2020).
Cacao is predicted to be vulnerable to climate change (Läderach et al. 2013; Medina and Laliberte 2017; Lahive et al. 2019). Being a species native to the understory of the Amazon rainforest, cacao is sensitive to drought and its growth and productivity have been shown to be negatively affected by high temperatures and low precipitation (Zuidema et al. 2005; De Almeida and Valle 2007; Daymond and Hadley 2008; Wood and Lass 2008; Moser et al. 2010). Optimal climatic conditions for cultivated cacao require average annual precipita- tions above 1,200 mm, dry seasons with less than three months with <100 mm/month, and maximum temperatures below 32 °C (Wood and Lass 2008; FAO 2023), while its soil pref- erences vary according to the climate, with soils with higher moisture-holding capacity being more important in drier regions and less important in wetter regions (Wood and Lass 2008; Ariza-Salamanca et al. 2023). Climate change has already started to impact cacao cultivation in producing countries, causing higher mortality of seedlings and mature trees, decrease in yield quantity and quality, and more frequent incidence of fungal diseases
(Medina and Laliberte 2017; Gateau-Rey et al. 2018).
Suitability modelling studies under climate change have reported contrasting trends for cacao. Loss of suitable area for cacao cultivation under future climate change has been predicted in West Africa (Läderach et al. 2013; Schroth et al. 2016), Central America (de Sousa et al. 2019), Peru (Ceccarelli et al. 2021), and the State of Bahia in Brazil (Heming et al. 2022). By contrast, other studies found that cacao cultivation may not be affected by climate change. A recent suitability modelling study in West Africa predicted that the suit- able area for cultivated cacao will remain constant or slightly expand (Ariza-Salamanca et al. 2023), while an experimental study demonstrated that the Net Primary Productivity of cacao is projected to stay the same or to increase slightly in this region (Black et al. 2020). Nonetheless, predicting the potential response of cacao to climate change in cacao- producing countries remains crucial to identify those areas where adaptation strategies may be most needed. In regions expected to lose suitability, adaptation options may be required to maintain cacao cultivation, such as installing irrigation, implementing agroforestry sys- tems to alter microclimatic conditions (Niether et al. 2018; Heming et al. 2022), and using
climate change tolerant genotypes (Ceccarelli et al. 2021).
The use of genotypes that show higher tolerance to climate extremes represents an inter- esting option to promote adaptation of cacao cultivation to climate change in Ecuador. Ecuador lies within both the centre of origin and the earliest currently known centre of domestication of cacao and thus harbours a very high diversity of both wild and cultivated native cacaos. Cacao’s putative centre of origin is situated in the Upper Amazon region shared by southern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, western Brazil to southern Peru, and this region presents the highest genetic diversity of wild cacaos across the Amazon (Motamayor et al. 2002, 2008; Thomas et al. 2012). Furthermore, the discovery of cacao in archaeologi- cal remains of the Mayo-Chinchipe-Marañón society, which occupied the region currently covered by the southern Ecuadorian and northern Peruvian Amazon, represents the earli-
est evidence of cacao domestication, dating back 5,300 years ago (Olivera-Núñez 2018;

Zarrillo et al. 2018). Cacao was only later brought from South America to Mesoamerica and further domesticated by Olmec and Maya people, possibly around 3,000–4,000 years ago which resulted in the Criollo cultivar (Henderson et al. 2007; Powis et al. 2011). The Nacional cultivar from Ecuador is likely to have been derived from the first domesticated cacao by the Moche-Chinchipe-Marañón society in the Amazon (Fouet et al. 2022; Thomas et al. 2023) and is now a group of several diverse genotypes spread across the country (Loor Solorzano et al. 2012). Nacional genotypes currently cover some 40% of the cacao cultivated area in Ecuador, while CCN-51 – which is another cacao cultivar developed in Ecuador – covers the remaining 60% (Ceccarelli et al. 2022). Ecuador also harbours several other local genotypes of cultivated cacao (Zambrano Flores et al. in press; Ceccarelli et al. 2022). The wide genetic diversity of cultivated and wild native cacao in Ecuador represents an important resource for genotype selection and breeding, and could be exploited to iden- tify genotypes tolerant to climate changes with interesting traits such as tolerance to high
temperatures and drought.
The objective of this study was 1) to evaluate the future impact of climate change on the suitable distributions of cultivated and wild cacao and 2) to identify areas where cli- mate change tolerant genotypes may occur in Ecuador. We modelled the present suitability distribution of cultivated and wild cacao and performed future climate projections under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0) and two time periods (2050s and 2070s). For both cultivated and wild cacao, we constructed six different ensem- ble models employing different filtering methods for presence points, we projected each ensemble model to future climatic conditions, and we then built the final maps of present distribution and future projections based on the majority-vote criterion, considering pres- ence in areas where at least four out of six ensemble models agree on suitability. We pre- dicted how cacao ecogeographical zones are expected to change under climate change and we carried out an outlier analysis based on the most important environmental variables for climate change to determine the areas where climate change tolerant genotypes are poten- tially present in Ecuador. We limited the search for tolerant genotypes within Ecuador in order to find genotypes that are adapted to local conditions and because the exchange and movement of genetic materials is currently restricted between cacao-producing countries. We discuss how climate change may impact cacao cultivation in Ecuador and suggest pos- sible adaptation options for cacao farmers, including the use of climate change tolerant
genotypes.
2 Methodology
2.1 Presence data
We retrieved the presence points of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) from several sources and divided them into cultivated and wild cacao. The presence points for cultivated cacao were retrieved from databases compiled by Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIAP), the CECAO-KAOKA partnership, the “Proyecto de Reacti- vación de Café y Cacao Nacional Fino de Aroma” from Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganadería, Acuacultura y Pesca (MAGAP), and Argüello et al. (2019). The presence points for wild cacao were retrieved from Motamayor et al. (2008) and from BIEN (Botanical Information and Ecology Network; www. biend ata. org; Maitner et al. 2018).
For cultivated cacao, we used only presence points within Ecuador, while for wild

cacao, we included all presence points occurring within the geographical extent of Ecuador (75.2–81.1°W; 1.5–5°S), also including points from neighbouring countries of Colombia and Peru. The compiled database had 26,152 presence points for culti- vated cacao and 95 presence points for wild cacao. Despite this species having a larger distribution in Latin America, we limited our modelling for cultivated cacao using only presence points within Ecuador and for wild cacao including also presence points from neighbouring countries, in order to capture the adaptation of local cacao populations and given the restricted exchange of cacao genetic resources across Latin American
countries.
Apart from the presence points of cultivated and wild cacao, we also collected pres- ence points of all tree and shrub species occurring in the study area, which were used for the target group approach for the modelling of wild cacao (see below). To compile the occurrence data to be used in the target group approach, we first compiled a list of all species of trees and shrubs occurring in Ecuador, Peru and Colombia from the national checklists of Peru (Brako and Zarucchi 1993), the national checklists of Ecua- dor (Jørgensen and León-Yánez 1999), the national checklists of Colombia (Bernal et al. 2015), DRYFLOR (Latin American Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest Floristic Net- work; www. dryfl or. info; DRYFLOR et al. (2016)), and the Plant Growth Form dataset for the New World (Engemann et al. 2016) and we then retrieved all the occurrence records for these species from BIEN, GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facil- ity; www. gbif. org; GBIF 2024), DRYFLOR, http:// www. dryfl or. info/ data), and sPlotO-
pen (Sabatini et al. 2021).
All presence points were quality checked to ensure they did not contain georefer- ence errors and uncertainties. Presence points were cleaned by deleting presence points collected before 1950, points with coordinates with zero decimals (as these have high probability to not be precise enough), and points located in a different country than the
country reported in the database.
2.2 Environmental variables
We used 27 environmental variables, comprising of 19 bioclimatic variables (Fick and Hijmans 2017) and 8 soil variables (Hengl et al. 2017) (Table 1). All the vari- ables were used at a resolution of 30 arcsec (ca. 0.9 km at the equator). We removed collinear variables under present climatic conditions using a stepwise calculation of variance inflation factors (VIF), retaining only variables with VIFs < 10 (Craney and Surles 2002; Chatterjee and Hadi 2006; Dormann et al. 2013). In addition, we also assessed collinearity under future conditions and retained all variables resulting from the stepwise VIF procedure in at least one time period-by-greenhouse gas emission scenario combination (Ceccarelli et al. 2021) (see below). This correlation assessment in future was performed to account for the fact that correlations between variables can change both in strength and direction in the future, which may lead to misleading pre- dictions if not addressed (Braunisch et al. 2013; Dormann et al. 2013). Multicollinear- ity analyses were based on the values of the environmental variables extracted from all the presence and pseudo-absence points that were used to calibrate the ensemble mod- els for cultivated and wild cacao, resulting in the same set of variables for both (see below). The final set of environmental variables retained for the suitability modelling
of cultivated and wild cacao consisted of 18 variables (Table 1).

2.3 Suitability modelling
We performed the suitability modelling – also called species distribution modelling or eco- logical niche modelling – of cultivated and wild cacao separately. This is because culti- vated and wild cacao have distinct distributions: the distribution of wild cacao is deter- mined by natural and ecological factors, whereas the niche of cultivated cacao in Ecuador is largely man-made, considering that most cultivation is carried out in the coastal areas
where cacao did not occur naturally prior to its human introduction to the region.
2.3.1 Pseudo‑absence points selection for cultivated and wild cacao
We used two different methods to select pseudo-absence points for cultivated and for wild cacao: we used the random approach for cultivated cacao and the target group approach (details outlined below) for wild cacao. These two methods were selected based on previous work by Ceccarelli et al. (2021) on suitability modelling in Peru which found that the random approach gives best results for cultivated cacao while the target group approach gives best
results for wild cacao. This is because the target group approach corrects the spatial bias of

the presence points of the modelled species by using data of other tree and shrubs species collected from other botanical surveys, which is informative for wild cacao, while a culti-
vated species whose niche is partially or mainly human-made benefits less from this data.
For both the random and the target group approach, we selected pseudo-absence points for the presence-absence algorithms in our ensembles and background points for the Maxent algorithm (see below). The number of pseudo-absence points was set to four times the number of presence points (Barbet‐Massin et al. 2012) and the number of background points was set to 20,000 (Phillips and Dudík 2008). Pseudo-absence and background points in both the random and target group approach were selected from the area enclosed by a convex hull constructed around all presence points of cultivated cacao and of wild cacao extended with a buffer cor- responding to 10% of the hull’s largest axis (Acevedo et al. 2012) (Fig. S1). As this convex hull also included parts of the high Andes, we further restricted it to areas below 3000 m a.s.l. (Ceccarelli et al. 2021). This helps to restrict the modelling to those areas where absences are most informative (Acevedo et al. 2012; Fremout et al. 2020), as absences above this threshold would reflect vastly different conditions as those where cacao could occur and would therefore not be very useful in our suitability models. This improves the ability of the suitability models
to discriminate between presence and absence at lower altitudes.
For the random approach used for cultivated cacao, pseudo-absence and background points were randomly selected from the convex hull area using the randomPoints function from the dismo package for R. For the target group approach used for wild cacao, pseudo-absence and background points were selected from the convex hull area following the method described by Phillips et al. (2009) and Mateo et al. (2010), which consists in selecting the points from grid cells with presences of species belonging to a similar group with the modelled species. These locations are expected to present a similar sampling bias as the modelled species, therefore reducing the impact of spatially biased presence points on model calibration (Phillips et al. 2009). In the target group approach, pseudo-absence points were selected from grid cells that did not contain any cacao presence points but where a reasonable number of tree and shrub species has been recorded by past botanical surveys (i.e. above ecoregion-specific minimum sampling intensities specified below), using the database of all occurrences of all tree and shrub species (see Sect. 2.1). Selecting pseudo-absence from these grid cells provide better confidence on the species absence: in locations where many species have been sampled but not cacao, cacao is more likely to be absent, while in locations where none or few species have been sampled, we cannot be confident on cacao absence. Sampling intensity was estimated as the number of species records per grid cell in the abovementioned compiled database of all tree and shrub species. Because species richness varies by ecoregion, minimum sampling intensities were set as the 95% percentile of species numbers per grid cell in each ecoregion, using the Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World map (Dinerstein et al. 2017). As background points do not distinguish between presence and absence (Sillero and Barbosa 2021), these were selected from any grid cell with at least one recorded species, without using a threshold for the sampling intensity. From here on, both pseudo-absence and background points will be
referred to as ‘pseudo-absence points’ for brevity.
2.3.2 Filtering of presence and pseudo‑absence points and construction of six ensemble models
For both cultivated and wild cacao, we generated six different ensemble models by com- bining two different approaches and three spatial resolutions for filtering presence and
pseudo-absence points. The aim of the filtering was to reduce the effects of spatially biased

presence points on model calibration (Kramer‐Schadt et al. 2013; Boria et al. 2014; Four-
cade et al. 2014).
The two filtering approaches used were geographical filtering and environmental filter- ing, and these were crossed with the three spatial resolutions of 5 arcmin (ca. 9 km at the equator), 10 arcmin (ca. 18 km) and 15 arcmin (ca. 27 km). As such, six ensemble models were constructed for both cultivated and wild cacao: three models with only geographic filtering (at 5, 10 and 15 arcmin), and three models with environmental filtering combined with different resolutions of geographic filtering (at 5, 10, and 15 arcmin). We used fil- tering resolutions from 5 up to 15 arcmin to address the high spatial bias especially of cultivated cacao, whose 26,152 points tend to have much higher sampling density in the coastal region and Andean foothills compared to the Ecuadorian Amazon with lower sam-
pling density.
Geographical filtering was implemented by randomly retaining one presence point per grid cell at each of the three spatial resolutions. Environmental filtering was implemented by first applying the geographical filtering at the three spatial resolutions and then perform- ing the environmental filtering using the envSample function (https:// github. com/ SaraV arela/ envSa mple; Varela et al. (2014)). In environmental filtering, a grid is placed in multi- variate environmental space made of cells that are measured in units of the environmental variables and presence points are filtered by randomly retaining one point from each cell in this multivariate space. We defined the dimensions of the cells as the first three principal components (PCs) obtained from a principal component analysis using the values of all the environmental variables extracted at the locations of the presence points of the species
being modelled.
After filtering, all ensemble models had more than 50 presence points (from 55 to 756 presence points, Table S1), which is agreed in species distribution modelling to be the number above which sample size become less critical and best accuracy metrics are
obtained (Wisz et al. 2008; van Proosdij et al. 2016; Guisan et al. 2017).
The pseudo-absence points of wild cacao selected with the target group approach were also filtered using the same method of geographical and environmental filtering as the presence points, in order to reflect the spatial bias of the filtered presences. On the contrary, the pseudo-absence points of cultivated cacao selected with the random approach were not filtered, as randomly selected points should not show spatial sorting bias.
2.3.3 Calibration and evaluation of the ensemble models
Suitability modelling was performed using ensemble models composed with the weighted averages of up to 17 modelling algorithms, as implemented in the BiodiversityR pack- age for R (Kindt 2018). Compared to using individual algorithms, ensemble models with weighted averages have the advantage of combining best model results across different algorithms that have all potentially plausible outcomes, thus increasing the accuracy of the models (Marmion et al. 2009). The modelling algorithms considered were: maximum entropy (MAXENT and MAXNET); maximum likelihood models (MAXLIKE); random forests (RF); generalized boosted models (GBM); generalized linear models (GLM and GLMSTEP); generalized additive models (GAM, GAMSTEP, MGCV); flexible discrimi- nant analysis (FDA); support vector machines (SVM and SVME); classification tree mod- els (RPART); neural networks (NNET); multiple adaptive regression splines (EARTH);
and BIOCLIM.

103 Page 8 of 22
Climatic Change (2024) 177:103
The algorithms in the ensemble models were cross-validated using spatial blocks with the blockCV package for R (Valavi et al. 2019), following Fremout et al. (2020). The weights of the algorithms in each of the ensemble models were optimized using the ensem- ble.tune function of the BiodiversityR package and the suitability values in the resulting ensemble model were obtained as the weighted average of the individual algorithms based on the abovementioned weights. The ensemble.tune function perform the weight optimiza- tion by maximizing the cross-validated Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (cvAUC) value of ensemble models by optimizing the weights of the different algorithms through a factorial procedure (Kindt 2018). Using the spatial block cross-validation, presence and pseudo-absence points were partitioned in training and testing points using a set of spatial blocks. This has the advantage that the obtained cvAUC values provide a better measure of model transferability, which is crucial when projecting species distributions to future climates (Wenger and Olden 2012; Muscarella et al. 2014). Presence and pseudo-absence points were partitioned into folds, each consisting of four or five 100 km-wide squared blocks. The number of folds and blocks within folds were selected based on the condi- tions that the maximum number of folds was set to ten and each fold should have at least four presence and absence points. This resulted into ten folds for the ensemble models for cultivated cacao and eight to ten folds for the ensemble models for wild cacao (Table S1). We report the mean cvAUC, retained algorithms and number of folds for each of the six ensemble models for cultivated and wild cacao in Table S1. After cross-validation, the ensemble models were calibrated again using all presence and pseudo-absence points and
the ensemble suitability predictions were made using the previously optimized weights.
2.3.4 Final presence maps
For each of the six ensemble models for cultivated and for wild cacao, suitability maps were converted to presence-absence maps by using the suitability threshold at 10 percentile omission rate, i.e. the largest threshold that leaves out 10% of presence records. Then, to produce the final presence maps for cultivated and wild cacao, we combined the presence- absence maps of the six ensemble models by using a majority-vote criterion, therefore con- sidering suitable areas where at least four out of the six ensemble models predict presence. From here on, any mentions in the text of the ‘distribution of cultivated cacao’ or the ‘dis-
tribution of wild cacao’ refer to these final presence maps.
2.4 Variable importance
We calculated the importance for each of the variables retained in the ensemble models for cultivated and wild cacao. First, we calculated the importance of the variables for each of the six ensemble models for cultivated and wild cacao. Variable importance was estimated according to the algorithm used in the biomod2 package for R (Thuiller 2003) by randomly shuffling the values of a single variable, making suitability predictions with the shuffled dataset, and computing the Pearson’s correlation (r) between the original suitability predic- tions and the suitability predictions with the shuffled dataset. The importance score was expressed as 1-r, ranging from 0 to 1 and with higher values corresponding to a higher variable importance. We calculated the final variable importance of each variable for culti-
vated and wild cacao as the average of the values of the six ensemble models.

2.5 Future projections under climate change
We performed the future projections for the each of the six ensemble models of cultivated and wild cacao, using two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0) and two time periods (2050s, average for 2041–2060; and 2070s, average for 2061–2080). For the future projections, we used the future condi- tions of the climatic variables, while we kept the soil variables constant as the present con- ditions, a common practice in distribution modelling (e.g. Shirk et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2022; Ariza-Salamanca et al. 2023), as no high-resolution future soil data are available and it is expected that soil will not drastically change, as compared to the large climatic changes that are foreseen in the next decades. Future climatic conditions were characterized using five well-performing and dissimilar Global Circulation Models (GCMs): ACCESS-CM2, GISS-E2-1-G, INM-CM5-0, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR. To select these GCMs, we used the list of best-performing and dissimilar GCMs identified by Brunner et al. (2020) and we selected all the GCMs from this list available on WorldClim v2.1 (Fick and Hijmans 2017).
For each of the six ensemble models of cultivated and wild cacao, we defined the area suitable under future climatic conditions as grid cells where at least three out of five GCMs predict suitability, following a majority-vote criterion. Then, we constructed the final maps of future projections for cultivated and wild cacao, again using the majority-vote criterion and defining as suitable those areas where at least four out of the six ensemble models pre-
dict presence in future.
It is important to note that the suitability models and future projections assess the impact of climate change on changes in the suitable area for cacao (i.e. the likelihood that the species can survive in a given area based on the environmental variables used to cali-
brate the models) and not on yield quantity or quality.
2.6 Ecogeographical zones
To assess changes in growth conditions within the suitable distribution range of culti- vated and wild cacao under climate change, we subdivided the current cacao distribution in Ecuador in different ecogeographical zones (Parra-Quijano et al. 2012) and projected these zones to future climatic conditions, following the methodology described in Fremout et al. (2021). The current cacao distribution was defined as the union of the distributions of both cultivated and wild cacao. We defined the ecogeographical zones using the Cluster- ing Large Applications (CLARA) method from the cluster package for R (Maechler et al. 2019). As input data, we used the first five principal components from a Principal Com- ponent Analysis (PCA) using values for all the 27 environmental variables, longitude and latitude extracted within the total current distribution range of cultivated and wild cacao, which together explained more than 90% of variance. The inclusion of longitude and lati- tude in the clustering avoids that very distant grid cells with similar environmental condi- tions end up in the same cluster (i.e. zone), a property that is desirable here, as genetic differences between species populations are generally related to both environmental differ- ences and geographic distance (Fremout et al. 2021). For the PCA, environmental variables were normalized prior to clustering, and longitude and latitude were rescaled to have a variance equal to the average variance of the first eight PCs. For future projections of the ecogeographical zones, we projected the predicted future environmental conditions of each
grid cell to the same PCs used for the current ecogeographical zones, after which each grid

Abstract
Climate change is expected to impact cacao cultivation in Ecuador, the fifth largest cacao producing country in the world and largest exporter of fine flavour cacao. The objective of this study was to evaluate the future impact of climate change on the suitable distribution of cultivated and wild cacao and identify areas where climate change tolerant genotypes may occur in Ecuador. Using 26,152 presence points for cultivated cacao and 95 presence points for wild cacao, we modelled the present suitability distribution of cultivated and wild cacao and performed future climate projections under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0) and two time periods (2050s and 2070s). For both cul- tivated and wild cacao, we constructed six different ensemble models employing different filtering methods for presence points, we projected each ensemble model to future climatic conditions, and we then built the final maps of present distribution and future projections based on the majority-vote criterion. Our future projections predict a 8–16% contraction and 19–21% expansion of the currently suitable area of cultivated cacao, while wild cacao is expected to maintain most of its suitable area and experience a further 7–12% expansion in the future. Ecogeographical zones are predicted to change in 23-33% of the combined distributions of cultivated and wild cacao. We identified the areas in Ecuador where popu- lations of climate change tolerant genotypes are expected to occur. Interventions to promote adaptation to climate change will be required in cacao cultivation areas that are expected to
be impacted by climate change in Ecuador, including the use of tolerant genotypes.

1 Introduction
Cacao is one of the most important cash crops in Ecuador. Ecuador is the fifth largest cacao producing country in the world (FAOSTAT 2019), with cacao cultivation covering ca. 525,000 ha (FAOSTAT 2019) and providing livelihoods to ca. 120,000 farmers (SENP-
LADES 2019). Cacao production in Ecuador has been steadily increasing over the past

years, rising from less than 200,000 t in the 2010s to 325,000 t in 2019–20 (Fountain and Hütz-Adams 2020). In particular, Ecuador produces the cacao cultivar called ‘Nacional’, which makes it the largest producer of fine flavour cacao, contributing to 63% of the total fine flavour cacao production globally (ANECACAO 2019). Fine flavour cacao is a cacao with attractive sensorial qualities and a special flavour profile, warranting premium prices as compared to bulk cacao which is primarily used for industrial productions (ICCO 2019). Although fine flavour cacao currently amounts to less than 5% of the world market (ICCO 2019), it has been expanding at a rate of 7–11% per year since 2011 (Vignati and Gómez-
García 2020).
Cacao is predicted to be vulnerable to climate change (Läderach et al. 2013; Medina and Laliberte 2017; Lahive et al. 2019). Being a species native to the understory of the Amazon rainforest, cacao is sensitive to drought and its growth and productivity have been shown to be negatively affected by high temperatures and low precipitation (Zuidema et al. 2005; De Almeida and Valle 2007; Daymond and Hadley 2008; Wood and Lass 2008; Moser et al. 2010). Optimal climatic conditions for cultivated cacao require average annual precipita- tions above 1,200 mm, dry seasons with less than three months with <100 mm/month, and maximum temperatures below 32 °C (Wood and Lass 2008; FAO 2023), while its soil pref- erences vary according to the climate, with soils with higher moisture-holding capacity being more important in drier regions and less important in wetter regions (Wood and Lass 2008; Ariza-Salamanca et al. 2023). Climate change has already started to impact cacao cultivation in producing countries, causing higher mortality of seedlings and mature trees, decrease in yield quantity and quality, and more frequent incidence of fungal diseases
(Medina and Laliberte 2017; Gateau-Rey et al. 2018).
Suitability modelling studies under climate change have reported contrasting trends for cacao. Loss of suitable area for cacao cultivation under future climate change has been predicted in West Africa (Läderach et al. 2013; Schroth et al. 2016), Central America (de Sousa et al. 2019), Peru (Ceccarelli et al. 2021), and the State of Bahia in Brazil (Heming et al. 2022). By contrast, other studies found that cacao cultivation may not be affected by climate change. A recent suitability modelling study in West Africa predicted that the suit- able area for cultivated cacao will remain constant or slightly expand (Ariza-Salamanca et al. 2023), while an experimental study demonstrated that the Net Primary Productivity of cacao is projected to stay the same or to increase slightly in this region (Black et al. 2020). Nonetheless, predicting the potential response of cacao to climate change in cacao- producing countries remains crucial to identify those areas where adaptation strategies may be most needed. In regions expected to lose suitability, adaptation options may be required to maintain cacao cultivation, such as installing irrigation, implementing agroforestry sys- tems to alter microclimatic conditions (Niether et al. 2018; Heming et al. 2022), and using
climate change tolerant genotypes (Ceccarelli et al. 2021).
The use of genotypes that show higher tolerance to climate extremes represents an inter- esting option to promote adaptation of cacao cultivation to climate change in Ecuador. Ecuador lies within both the centre of origin and the earliest currently known centre of domestication of cacao and thus harbours a very high diversity of both wild and cultivated native cacaos. Cacao’s putative centre of origin is situated in the Upper Amazon region shared by southern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, western Brazil to southern Peru, and this region presents the highest genetic diversity of wild cacaos across the Amazon (Motamayor et al. 2002, 2008; Thomas et al. 2012). Furthermore, the discovery of cacao in archaeologi- cal remains of the Mayo-Chinchipe-Marañón society, which occupied the region currently covered by the southern Ecuadorian and northern Peruvian Amazon, represents the earli-
est evidence of cacao domestication, dating back 5,300 years ago (Olivera-Núñez 2018;
a Springer

Zarrillo et al. 2018). Cacao was only later brought from South America to Mesoamerica and further domesticated by Olmec and Maya people, possibly around 3,000–4,000 years ago which resulted in the Criollo cultivar (Henderson et al. 2007; Powis et al. 2011). The Nacional cultivar from Ecuador is likely to have been derived from the first domesticated cacao by the Moche-Chinchipe-Marañón society in the Amazon (Fouet et al. 2022; Thomas et al. 2023) and is now a group of several diverse genotypes spread across the country (Loor Solorzano et al. 2012). Nacional genotypes currently cover some 40% of the cacao cultivated area in Ecuador, while CCN-51 – which is another cacao cultivar developed in Ecuador – covers the remaining 60% (Ceccarelli et al. 2022). Ecuador also harbours several other local genotypes of cultivated cacao (Zambrano Flores et al. in press; Ceccarelli et al. 2022). The wide genetic diversity of cultivated and wild native cacao in Ecuador represents an important resource for genotype selection and breeding, and could be exploited to iden- tify genotypes tolerant to climate changes with interesting traits such as tolerance to high
temperatures and drought.
The objective of this study was 1) to evaluate the future impact of climate change on the suitable distributions of cultivated and wild cacao and 2) to identify areas where cli- mate change tolerant genotypes may occur in Ecuador. We modelled the present suitability distribution of cultivated and wild cacao and performed future climate projections under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0) and two time periods (2050s and 2070s). For both cultivated and wild cacao, we constructed six different ensem- ble models employing different filtering methods for presence points, we projected each ensemble model to future climatic conditions, and we then built the final maps of present distribution and future projections based on the majority-vote criterion, considering pres- ence in areas where at least four out of six ensemble models agree on suitability. We pre- dicted how cacao ecogeographical zones are expected to change under climate change and we carried out an outlier analysis based on the most important environmental variables for climate change to determine the areas where climate change tolerant genotypes are poten- tially present in Ecuador. We limited the search for tolerant genotypes within Ecuador in order to find genotypes that are adapted to local conditions and because the exchange and movement of genetic materials is currently restricted between cacao-producing countries. We discuss how climate change may impact cacao cultivation in Ecuador and suggest pos- sible adaptation options for cacao farmers, including the use of climate change tolerant
genotypes.
2 Methodology
2.1 Presence data
We retrieved the presence points of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) from several sources and divided them into cultivated and wild cacao. The presence points for cultivated cacao were retrieved from databases compiled by Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIAP), the CECAO-KAOKA partnership, the “Proyecto de Reacti- vación de Café y Cacao Nacional Fino de Aroma” from Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganadería, Acuacultura y Pesca (MAGAP), and Argüello et al. (2019). The presence points for wild cacao were retrieved from Motamayor et al. (2008) and from BIEN (Botanical Information and Ecology Network; www. biend ata. org; Maitner et al. 2018).
For cultivated cacao, we used only presence points within Ecuador, while for wild

cacao, we included all presence points occurring within the geographical extent of Ecuador (75.2–81.1°W; 1.5–5°S), also including points from neighbouring countries of Colombia and Peru. The compiled database had 26,152 presence points for culti- vated cacao and 95 presence points for wild cacao. Despite this species having a larger distribution in Latin America, we limited our modelling for cultivated cacao using only presence points within Ecuador and for wild cacao including also presence points from neighbouring countries, in order to capture the adaptation of local cacao populations and given the restricted exchange of cacao genetic resources across Latin American
countries.
Apart from the presence points of cultivated and wild cacao, we also collected pres- ence points of all tree and shrub species occurring in the study area, which were used for the target group approach for the modelling of wild cacao (see below). To compile the occurrence data to be used in the target group approach, we first compiled a list of all species of trees and shrubs occurring in Ecuador, Peru and Colombia from the national checklists of Peru (Brako and Zarucchi 1993), the national checklists of Ecua- dor (Jørgensen and León-Yánez 1999), the national checklists of Colombia (Bernal et al. 2015), DRYFLOR (Latin American Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest Floristic Net- work; www. dryfl or. info; DRYFLOR et al. (2016)), and the Plant Growth Form dataset for the New World (Engemann et al. 2016) and we then retrieved all the occurrence records for these species from BIEN, GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facil- ity; www. gbif. org; GBIF 2024), DRYFLOR, http:// www. dryfl or. info/ data), and sPlotO-
pen (Sabatini et al. 2021).
All presence points were quality checked to ensure they did not contain georefer- ence errors and uncertainties. Presence points were cleaned by deleting presence points collected before 1950, points with coordinates with zero decimals (as these have high probability to not be precise enough), and points located in a different country than the
country reported in the database.
2.2 Environmental variables
We used 27 environmental variables, comprising of 19 bioclimatic variables (Fick and Hijmans 2017) and 8 soil variables (Hengl et al. 2017) (Table 1). All the vari- ables were used at a resolution of 30 arcsec (ca. 0.9 km at the equator). We removed collinear variables under present climatic conditions using a stepwise calculation of variance inflation factors (VIF), retaining only variables with VIFs < 10 (Craney and Surles 2002; Chatterjee and Hadi 2006; Dormann et al. 2013). In addition, we also assessed collinearity under future conditions and retained all variables resulting from the stepwise VIF procedure in at least one time period-by-greenhouse gas emission scenario combination (Ceccarelli et al. 2021) (see below). This correlation assessment in future was performed to account for the fact that correlations between variables can change both in strength and direction in the future, which may lead to misleading pre- dictions if not addressed (Braunisch et al. 2013; Dormann et al. 2013). Multicollinear- ity analyses were based on the values of the environmental variables extracted from all the presence and pseudo-absence points that were used to calibrate the ensemble mod- els for cultivated and wild cacao, resulting in the same set of variables for both (see below). The final set of environmental variables retained for the suitability modelling
of cultivated and wild cacao consisted of 18 variables (Table 1).

2.3 Suitability modelling
We performed the suitability modelling – also called species distribution modelling or eco- logical niche modelling – of cultivated and wild cacao separately. This is because culti- vated and wild cacao have distinct distributions: the distribution of wild cacao is deter- mined by natural and ecological factors, whereas the niche of cultivated cacao in Ecuador is largely man-made, considering that most cultivation is carried out in the coastal areas
where cacao did not occur naturally prior to its human introduction to the region.
2.3.1 Pseudo‑absence points selection for cultivated and wild cacao
We used two different methods to select pseudo-absence points for cultivated and for wild cacao: we used the random approach for cultivated cacao and the target group approach (details outlined below) for wild cacao. These two methods were selected based on previous work by Ceccarelli et al. (2021) on suitability modelling in Peru which found that the random approach gives best results for cultivated cacao while the target group approach gives best
results for wild cacao. This is because the target group approach corrects the spatial bias of

the presence points of the modelled species by using data of other tree and shrubs species collected from other botanical surveys, which is informative for wild cacao, while a culti-
vated species whose niche is partially or mainly human-made benefits less from this data.
For both the random and the target group approach, we selected pseudo-absence points for the presence-absence algorithms in our ensembles and background points for the Maxent algorithm (see below). The number of pseudo-absence points was set to four times the number of presence points (Barbet‐Massin et al. 2012) and the number of background points was set to 20,000 (Phillips and Dudík 2008). Pseudo-absence and background points in both the random and target group approach were selected from the area enclosed by a convex hull constructed around all presence points of cultivated cacao and of wild cacao extended with a buffer cor- responding to 10% of the hull’s largest axis (Acevedo et al. 2012) (Fig. S1). As this convex hull also included parts of the high Andes, we further restricted it to areas below 3000 m a.s.l. (Ceccarelli et al. 2021). This helps to restrict the modelling to those areas where absences are most informative (Acevedo et al. 2012; Fremout et al. 2020), as absences above this threshold would reflect vastly different conditions as those where cacao could occur and would therefore not be very useful in our suitability models. This improves the ability of the suitability models
to discriminate between presence and absence at lower altitudes.
For the random approach used for cultivated cacao, pseudo-absence and background points were randomly selected from the convex hull area using the randomPoints function from the dismo package for R. For the target group approach used for wild cacao, pseudo-absence and background points were selected from the convex hull area following the method described by Phillips et al. (2009) and Mateo et al. (2010), which consists in selecting the points from grid cells with presences of species belonging to a similar group with the modelled species. These locations are expected to present a similar sampling bias as the modelled species, therefore reducing the impact of spatially biased presence points on model calibration (Phillips et al. 2009). In the target group approach, pseudo-absence points were selected from grid cells that did not contain any cacao presence points but where a reasonable number of tree and shrub species has been recorded by past botanical surveys (i.e. above ecoregion-specific minimum sampling intensities specified below), using the database of all occurrences of all tree and shrub species (see Sect. 2.1). Selecting pseudo-absence from these grid cells provide better confidence on the species absence: in locations where many species have been sampled but not cacao, cacao is more likely to be absent, while in locations where none or few species have been sampled, we cannot be confident on cacao absence. Sampling intensity was estimated as the number of species records per grid cell in the abovementioned compiled database of all tree and shrub species. Because species richness varies by ecoregion, minimum sampling intensities were set as the 95% percentile of species numbers per grid cell in each ecoregion, using the Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World map (Dinerstein et al. 2017). As background points do not distinguish between presence and absence (Sillero and Barbosa 2021), these were selected from any grid cell with at least one recorded species, without using a threshold for the sampling intensity. From here on, both pseudo-absence and background points will be
referred to as ‘pseudo-absence points’ for brevity.
2.3.2 Filtering of presence and pseudo‑absence points and construction of six ensemble models
For both cultivated and wild cacao, we generated six different ensemble models by com- bining two different approaches and three spatial resolutions for filtering presence and
pseudo-absence points. The aim of the filtering was to reduce the effects of spatially biased

presence points on model calibration (Kramer‐Schadt et al. 2013; Boria et al. 2014; Four-
cade et al. 2014).
The two filtering approaches used were geographical filtering and environmental filter- ing, and these were crossed with the three spatial resolutions of 5 arcmin (ca. 9 km at the equator), 10 arcmin (ca. 18 km) and 15 arcmin (ca. 27 km). As such, six ensemble models were constructed for both cultivated and wild cacao: three models with only geographic filtering (at 5, 10 and 15 arcmin), and three models with environmental filtering combined with different resolutions of geographic filtering (at 5, 10, and 15 arcmin). We used fil- tering resolutions from 5 up to 15 arcmin to address the high spatial bias especially of cultivated cacao, whose 26,152 points tend to have much higher sampling density in the coastal region and Andean foothills compared to the Ecuadorian Amazon with lower sam-
pling density.
Geographical filtering was implemented by randomly retaining one presence point per grid cell at each of the three spatial resolutions. Environmental filtering was implemented by first applying the geographical filtering at the three spatial resolutions and then perform- ing the environmental filtering using the envSample function (https:// github. com/ SaraV arela/ envSa mple; Varela et al. (2014)). In environmental filtering, a grid is placed in multi- variate environmental space made of cells that are measured in units of the environmental variables and presence points are filtered by randomly retaining one point from each cell in this multivariate space. We defined the dimensions of the cells as the first three principal components (PCs) obtained from a principal component analysis using the values of all the environmental variables extracted at the locations of the presence points of the species
being modelled.
After filtering, all ensemble models had more than 50 presence points (from 55 to 756 presence points, Table S1), which is agreed in species distribution modelling to be the number above which sample size become less critical and best accuracy metrics are
obtained (Wisz et al. 2008; van Proosdij et al. 2016; Guisan et al. 2017).
The pseudo-absence points of wild cacao selected with the target group approach were also filtered using the same method of geographical and environmental filtering as the presence points, in order to reflect the spatial bias of the filtered presences. On the contrary, the pseudo-absence points of cultivated cacao selected with the random approach were not filtered, as randomly selected points should not show spatial sorting bias.
2.3.3 Calibration and evaluation of the ensemble models
Suitability modelling was performed using ensemble models composed with the weighted averages of up to 17 modelling algorithms, as implemented in the BiodiversityR pack- age for R (Kindt 2018). Compared to using individual algorithms, ensemble models with weighted averages have the advantage of combining best model results across different algorithms that have all potentially plausible outcomes, thus increasing the accuracy of the models (Marmion et al. 2009). The modelling algorithms considered were: maximum entropy (MAXENT and MAXNET); maximum likelihood models (MAXLIKE); random forests (RF); generalized boosted models (GBM); generalized linear models (GLM and GLMSTEP); generalized additive models (GAM, GAMSTEP, MGCV); flexible discrimi- nant analysis (FDA); support vector machines (SVM and SVME); classification tree mod- els (RPART); neural networks (NNET); multiple adaptive regression splines (EARTH);
and BIOCLIM.
®D Springer
103 Page 8 of 22
Climatic Change (2024) 177:103
The algorithms in the ensemble models were cross-validated using spatial blocks with the blockCV package for R (Valavi et al. 2019), following Fremout et al. (2020). The weights of the algorithms in each of the ensemble models were optimized using the ensem- ble.tune function of the BiodiversityR package and the suitability values in the resulting ensemble model were obtained as the weighted average of the individual algorithms based on the abovementioned weights. The ensemble.tune function perform the weight optimiza- tion by maximizing the cross-validated Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (cvAUC) value of ensemble models by optimizing the weights of the different algorithms through a factorial procedure (Kindt 2018). Using the spatial block cross-validation, presence and pseudo-absence points were partitioned in training and testing points using a set of spatial blocks. This has the advantage that the obtained cvAUC values provide a better measure of model transferability, which is crucial when projecting species distributions to future climates (Wenger and Olden 2012; Muscarella et al. 2014). Presence and pseudo-absence points were partitioned into folds, each consisting of four or five 100 km-wide squared blocks. The number of folds and blocks within folds were selected based on the condi- tions that the maximum number of folds was set to ten and each fold should have at least four presence and absence points. This resulted into ten folds for the ensemble models for cultivated cacao and eight to ten folds for the ensemble models for wild cacao (Table S1). We report the mean cvAUC, retained algorithms and number of folds for each of the six ensemble models for cultivated and wild cacao in Table S1. After cross-validation, the ensemble models were calibrated again using all presence and pseudo-absence points and
the ensemble suitability predictions were made using the previously optimized weights.
2.3.4 Final presence maps
For each of the six ensemble models for cultivated and for wild cacao, suitability maps were converted to presence-absence maps by using the suitability threshold at 10 percentile omission rate, i.e. the largest threshold that leaves out 10% of presence records. Then, to produce the final presence maps for cultivated and wild cacao, we combined the presence- absence maps of the six ensemble models by using a majority-vote criterion, therefore con- sidering suitable areas where at least four out of the six ensemble models predict presence. From here on, any mentions in the text of the ‘distribution of cultivated cacao’ or the ‘dis-
tribution of wild cacao’ refer to these final presence maps.
2.4 Variable importance
We calculated the importance for each of the variables retained in the ensemble models for cultivated and wild cacao. First, we calculated the importance of the variables for each of the six ensemble models for cultivated and wild cacao. Variable importance was estimated according to the algorithm used in the biomod2 package for R (Thuiller 2003) by randomly shuffling the values of a single variable, making suitability predictions with the shuffled dataset, and computing the Pearson’s correlation (r) between the original suitability predic- tions and the suitability predictions with the shuffled dataset. The importance score was expressed as 1-r, ranging from 0 to 1 and with higher values corresponding to a higher variable importance. We calculated the final variable importance of each variable for culti-
vated and wild cacao as the average of the values of the six ensemble models.

2.5 Future projections under climate change
We performed the future projections for the each of the six ensemble models of cultivated and wild cacao, using two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0) and two time periods (2050s, average for 2041–2060; and 2070s, average for 2061–2080). For the future projections, we used the future condi- tions of the climatic variables, while we kept the soil variables constant as the present con- ditions, a common practice in distribution modelling (e.g. Shirk et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2022; Ariza-Salamanca et al. 2023), as no high-resolution future soil data are available and it is expected that soil will not drastically change, as compared to the large climatic changes that are foreseen in the next decades. Future climatic conditions were characterized using five well-performing and dissimilar Global Circulation Models (GCMs): ACCESS-CM2, GISS-E2-1-G, INM-CM5-0, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR. To select these GCMs, we used the list of best-performing and dissimilar GCMs identified by Brunner et al. (2020) and we selected all the GCMs from this list available on WorldClim v2.1 (Fick and Hijmans 2017).
For each of the six ensemble models of cultivated and wild cacao, we defined the area suitable under future climatic conditions as grid cells where at least three out of five GCMs predict suitability, following a majority-vote criterion. Then, we constructed the final maps of future projections for cultivated and wild cacao, again using the majority-vote criterion and defining as suitable those areas where at least four out of the six ensemble models pre-
dict presence in future.
It is important to note that the suitability models and future projections assess the impact of climate change on changes in the suitable area for cacao (i.e. the likelihood that the species can survive in a given area based on the environmental variables used to cali-
brate the models) and not on yield quantity or quality.
2.6 Ecogeographical zones
To assess changes in growth conditions within the suitable distribution range of culti- vated and wild cacao under climate change, we subdivided the current cacao distribution in Ecuador in different ecogeographical zones (Parra-Quijano et al. 2012) and projected these zones to future climatic conditions, following the methodology described in Fremout et al. (2021). The current cacao distribution was defined as the union of the distributions of both cultivated and wild cacao. We defined the ecogeographical zones using the Cluster- ing Large Applications (CLARA) method from the cluster package for R (Maechler et al. 2019). As input data, we used the first five principal components from a Principal Com- ponent Analysis (PCA) using values for all the 27 environmental variables, longitude and latitude extracted within the total current distribution range of cultivated and wild cacao, which together explained more than 90% of variance. The inclusion of longitude and lati- tude in the clustering avoids that very distant grid cells with similar environmental condi- tions end up in the same cluster (i.e. zone), a property that is desirable here, as genetic differences between species populations are generally related to both environmental differ- ences and geographic distance (Fremout et al. 2021). For the PCA, environmental variables were normalized prior to clustering, and longitude and latitude were rescaled to have a variance equal to the average variance of the first eight PCs. For future projections of the ecogeographical zones, we projected the predicted future environmental conditions of each
grid cell to the same PCs used for the current ecogeographical zones, after which each grid

Introducción 
Potencial de producción de semillas en forrajes tropicales
Uno de los objetivos del programa de mejoramiento del CIAT es desarrollar híbridos de pastos forrajeros con mayor rendimiento de semillas.
El potencial de rendimiento de semillas depende de varios factores, entre ellos, la cantidad de racimos presentes en la planta analizada. Por ende, es necesario detectar y contar los racimos individuales.
Sin embargo, esta tarea require demasiada mano de obra para hacerse manualmente y es muy compleja para los algoritmos clásicos del aprendizaje automático (ML).
Por lo cual, si se requiere abordar esta tarea de manera rápida y eficiente se debe implementar fenotipado de alto rendimiento (HTP) en conjunto con técnicas de vision por computadora e inteligencia artificial.

Se tomaron imágenes de 200 variedades de híbridos de Urochloa a lo largo de 7 meses (entre Agosto de 2016 y febrero de 2017) para un total de 2400 imágenes. El ensayo se organizó en 4 filas de 50 plantas cada una con un espaciado de 1.5 m. Se tomaron imágenes individuales en RGB para cada uno de los 200 híbridos utilizando una cámara profesional. La cámara se montó a una altura fija de 1.2 m para asegurar una perspectiva uniformes en todas las imágenes. El buggy estaba cubierto con un difusor de luz para asegurar una iluminación uniforme y suave en el campo de visión de la cámara.

Debido al tamaño original de las imágenes se han tenido que probar varias técnicas para tratar de disminuir el coste computacional al momento de entrenar el modelo
▪ Recorte: Las imágenes se han recortado usando diferente relación de aspecto (imágenes cuadradas o rectangulares). Se han probado con recortes de: 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024 y 1584x2112
▪ Submuestreo: Debido a que el recorte introducía ruido en cuanto a la morfología de los racimos y en cuanto a la cantidad de racimos por imagen durante el entrenamiento fue necesario implementar un submuestreo para evitar estos inconvenientes. Este submuestreo se hizo garantizando tener una relación de aspecto 4/3 en las imágenes. Se probaron los valores: 3840x2880 y 2752x2048

Posprocesado: aumento de datos caso “recorte”
Después del proceso de anotación, las máscaras se recortaron para alinearlas con las imágenes originales. Luego se eliminaron las máscaras (y sus imágenes correspondientes) que no contenían racimos, junto con aquellas con un recuento total de píxeles por debajo de un cierto umbral. Este paso fue crucial porque el proceso de recorte dio como resultado que algunas máscaras (y sus imágenes) tuvieran un porcentaje insuficiente de racimos, que se excluyeron para minimizar el ruido en el modelo.

Posprocesado: aumento de datos caso “submuestreo”
Se implementaron transformaciones de color y de geometría para aumentar el conjunto de datos y generar entrenar un modelo que sea más robusto ante este tipo de variaciones en la etapa de implementación real (inferencia).
Las transformaciones de color se aplicaron únicamente a las imágenes, mientras que las geométricas a las imágenes y a las máscaras.





¥@ Y Alianza \ Bioversity & CIAT CGIAR
Problema de formato para almacenar máscaras.
Este problema surge por el formato para almacenar la máscara (máscara de segmentación 1.1). Por alguna razón, este formato sólo permite almacenar 255 colores diferentes, es decir, 255 instancias diferentes. Entonces, para superar este problema fue necesario utilizar, nuevamente, el formato COCO y cambiar el código para adaptar este formato.

Entrenamiento del modelo
• Se decide usar el modelo MaskRCNN debido a que de acuerdo al estado del arte consultado es el tipo de modelo adecuado para el objetivo de este Proyecto.
• MaskRCNN es un framework de 2 etapas principales:
1. Backbone (CNN): Detecta las caracterÍsticas (bordes, texturas, colores, etc.)
2. Regiones de interés (RPN + RoiAlign): Se seleccionan áreas específicas de la imagen que podrian contener objetos; El RoiAlign es un método inteligente que toma estas regiones y estandariza en tamaño y forma para que la red pueda procesarlas más facilmente las
3. Capas Convolucionales: Las regiones estandarizadas pasan a través de las capas “conv” de la red que trabajan en identificar más detalles sobre el objeto, como su forma exacta y qué clase de objeto podría ser.
4. Clasificación y bounding box: Paralelamente, la red también decide qué etiqueta ponerle al objeto y ajusta los bounding boxes
5. Segmentación de la mascara: Finalmente, Mask RCNN crea una máscara del objeto.

Resultados iniciales: Primeros 6 modelos contrastados
Conteo: 0 (0%)
Conteo: 851 (100%)
1.
El modelo inicial construido no pudo detectar ningún racimo debido a la divergencia en el entrenamiento.
2.
El segundo modelo logró una tasa de detección del 100%, lo que sugiere un problema de sobreajuste. Este sobreajuste es debido al conjunto de datos de entrenamiento tan pequeño, que comprendía solo 4 imágenes.


3. Los modelos 3, 4 y 5 lograron aumentar de manera progresiva el rendimiento debido a una mayor cantidad de datos y mejor ajuste de hiperpámetros.
4. El modelo 6 bajó su rendimiento debido a una disminución en el hiperparámetro rpn_nms_threshold

Conclusiones
• Resnet 50 parece tener un mejor rendimiento que resnet 101 en inferencia.
• Tener una pequeña tasa de aprendizaje ayuda a tener una pequeña pérdida.
• Recortar las imágenes causa algunos problemas en la inferencia, debido a algunas clasificaciones erróneas de los racimos.
• Necesito aumentar las plantas que tienen muchos racimos (255) y cambiar el formato que estoy usando para guardar las máscaras.
• Después de recortar las imágenes y realizar aumentos en el conjunto de datos, se producen más clasificaciones erróneas debido a que algunos racimos se recortan en al menos dos partes.
Trabajos futuros
• Hacer fine-tuning con nuevas imágenes tomadas bajo diferentes condiciones: de iluminación, de ángulo de captura, de altura, en diferentes horas del día, bajo diferentes etapas fenológicas, entre otras.
• Mejor ajuste de algunos hiperperámetros para reducer el tiempo de entrenamiento del modelo.
• Normalizar los datos para el proceso de entrenamiento.
• Probar otro enfoque de modelos de aprendizaje profundo, como YOLO-V8

Se implementaron transformaciones de color y de geometría para aumentar el conjunto de datos y generar entrenar un modelo que sea más robusto ante este tipo de variaciones en la etapa de implementación real (inferencia).
Las transformaciones de color se aplicaron únicamente a las imágenes, mientras que las geométricas a las imágenes y a las máscaras.

Problema de formato para almacenar máscaras.
Este problema surge por el formato para almacenar la máscara (máscara de segmentación 1.1). Por alguna razón, este formato sólo permite almacenar 255 colores diferentes, es decir, 255 instancias diferentes. Entonces, para superar este problema fue necesario utilizar, nuevamente, el formato COCO y cambiar el código para adaptar este formato.

Entrenamiento del modelo
• Se decide usar el modelo MaskRCNN debido a que de acuerdo al estado del arte consultado es el tipo de modelo adecuado para el objetivo de este Proyecto.
• MaskRCNN es un framework de 2 etapas principales:
1. Backbone (CNN): Detecta las caracterÍsticas (bordes, texturas, colores, etc.)
2. Regiones de interés (RPN + RoiAlign): Se seleccionan áreas específicas de la imagen que podrian contener objetos; El RoiAlign es un método inteligente que toma estas regiones y estandariza en tamaño y forma para que la red pueda procesarlas más facilmente las
3. Capas Convolucionales: Las regiones estandarizadas pasan a través de las capas “conv” de la red que trabajan en identificar más detalles sobre el objeto, como su forma exacta y qué clase de objeto podría ser.
4. Clasificación y bounding box: Paralelamente, la red también decide qué etiqueta ponerle al objeto y ajusta los bounding boxes
5. Segmentación de la mascara: Finalmente, Mask RCNN crea una máscara del objeto.

Conclusiones
• Resnet 50 parece tener un mejor rendimiento que resnet 101 en inferencia.
• Tener una pequeña tasa de aprendizaje ayuda a tener una pequeña pérdida.
• Recortar las imágenes causa algunos problemas en la inferencia, debido a algunas clasificaciones erróneas de los racimos.
• Necesito aumentar las plantas que tienen muchos racimos (255) y cambiar el formato que estoy usando para guardar las máscaras.
• Después de recortar las imágenes y realizar aumentos en el conjunto de datos, se producen más clasificaciones erróneas debido a que algunos racimos se recortan en al menos dos partes.
Trabajos futuros
• Hacer fine-tuning con nuevas imágenes tomadas bajo diferentes condiciones: de iluminación, de ángulo de captura, de altura, en diferentes horas del día, bajo diferentes etapas fenológicas, entre otras.
• Mejor ajuste de algunos hiperperámetros para reducer el tiempo de entrenamiento del modelo.
• Normalizar los datos para el proceso de entrenamiento.
• Probar otro enfoque de modelos de aprendizaje profundo, como YOLO-V8

Highlights
Context
This policy brief presents findings from a review of secondary literature and primary research conducted in Khulna District in southern Bangladesh on the access of coastal fishers to common pool water resources. The study, supported by the CGIAR initiatives – Asian Mega-Deltas (AMD) and Aquatic Foods (AqFI) – and the Transboundary Rivers of South Asia (TROSA) Project, examined the impacts of water resources governance on rural fishers who rely solely on wildlife fishing in freshwater bodies for their livelihood (hereafter referred to as ‘capture fishers’).
Key findings
Fish is a dietary staple in Bangladesh and the Bengali identity is said to be essentially “Maache-bhate Bangali” (A Bengali is essentially fish and rice) (Shamsuzzaman et al. 2017). Bangladesh is home to the world’s largest flooded wetlands and has the third-largest aquatic biodiversity in Asia (Shamsuzzaman et al. 2017). Although, Bangladesh is the third-largest producer of inland fisheries globally (FAO 2022), the potential for a fish-focused economy is not fully realized. Currently, the fisheries sector contributes 3.69 percent to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 22.6 percent to its agricultural GDP (DoF 2017). Inland capture fisheries are vital in Bangladesh, accounting for 83 percent of fish production from freshwater sources, while the remaining 17 percent is accounted for by marine fisheries (Shamsuzzaman et al. 2017).
{ Inland capture fisheries account for 83 percent of fish production in Bangladesh, with capture fisheries contributing 27 percent to overall fish production (DoF 2017). Despite this significant contribution, capture fishers are generally excluded from water resources decision- making, which tends to be crop-centric.
{ Capture fishers are also adversely impacted by legal bans or restrictions on fishing, exercised multiple times during the year. During the year, capture fishers who have been provided official ID cards are entitled to a food subsidy of 40 kilograms (kg) of rice per cardholder household per month for a period of two months. However, these fisher ID cards are issued only to the male head of the household. Additionally, the food subsidies do not cover the multiple bans during the year and are inadequate for meeting household food needs and other living costs. These fishing bans significantly increase the vulnerability of marginalized capture fishers who are mostly landless and
lack alternative livelihoods.
{ Annual fishing bans stipulated in fishery policies and other interventions are designed to protect water resources and fish species. These protection measures do not impact commercial fishery activities, and instead further marginalize capture fishers, whose ecological footprints are disproportionately smaller.
{ This study recommends more participatory and transparent water management and governance, including better coordination between the fisheries, forestry, environment, agriculture, and other relevant water use sectors, and establishing a more representative monitoring system for water resources access, use, and governance. The study also recommends a more critical analysis of the efficacy and implications of currently enforced fishing bans, as well as improved social welfare measures, including the revision of food subsidies and
gender-equitable access to fisher ID cards.
Among those who depend on these inland waterbodies, including rivers, canals, freshwater lakes, and seasonally inundated floodplain wetlands, are large numbers of landless, marginalized capture fishers who rely on fishing as their sole or primary livelihood (Sunny et al. 2020). This fisher community, a key stakeholder in aquatic resources governance, is also one of the most vulnerable and poorest in terms of livelihood security (Rahman and Rahman 2015).
The focus of this study was Khulna District, which is also home to the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forests, with a unique ecological system and declared an UNESCO biodiversity area. We were interested in this region as it houses large numbers of marginalized, landless groups who rely on capture fisheries, including within the boundaries of this biodiversity reserve.
In this region, participatory water resources governance interventions, promoted in Bangladesh since the early 2000s, are often not aligned with environment conservation initiatives. This conflict, impacting the landless, forest- dependent users, is also reported across the country’s fifty-four protected areas (Ray et al. 2023). As a result, participatory approaches are not always implemented and marginalized populations tend to be excluded from natural resources decision-making processes (Irfanullah et al. 2023). It has been reported that in Khulna District too, the needs of small-scale, marginal capture fishers are often overlooked in fisheries, water, and forest management policies and interventions, especially within the boundaries of the Sundarbans (Liyana 2021).
Sustainable management of the Sundarbans is critical. The ecosystem supports biodiversity and local livelihoods and is also a barrier to storm surges intensified by climate change (Hoq 2014). However, conservation policies can fail to consider the balance between ecological sustainability
December 2024 | Advancing equitable access to common pool water resources for fishers in coastal Bangladesh 2
and socio-economic and political ground realities (Khan and Haque 2010). For marginalized communities, like capture fishers who rely on common pool resources for subsistence livelihoods, there are significant barriers to inclusion (Mondal et al. 2021).
Access to common pool water resources and participation in decision-making
1. Water resources governance, legal restrictions, and the lack of alternative livelihoods
These fishing bans have been reported to result in an increase in hilsa production, but they seriously impact the livelihoods and customary rights of subsistence and marginal fishers (Nahiduzzaman et al. 2018), historically dependent on these waterbodies for their livelihoods. For instance, a recent 65-day ban on fishing in the Bay of Bengal left 70 percent of the fishers unemployed, without any source of income for this entire period. These bans also impact food and nutritional security. In the absence of the ban, around 96 percent of fisher families reported eating three meals a day. This figure dropped to 49 percent during the ban period (Munir 2023). Other than the food subsidy of 40 kgs of rice provided for 2 months during the 65-day ban period, there are no other social protection interventions in place.
The absence of welfare policies often drives some fishers to violate the fishing bans. But such practices are highly risk-prone. For instance, findings show that from 2011–2012 to 2013–2014, local executive courts imposed 2,462 prison sentences and fined marginalized fishers a total of more than BDT 13 million (around USD 107,000) for violating conservation bans.
The centralization of natural resources policies and governance have a colonial history in the sub-continent. Colonial-era policies, dating back to 1878, restricted the access of local communities to the Sundarbans, including its water bodies (Siddique et al. 2023). However, the focus of these colonial policies was not conservation, but to ensure a regular supply of timber and revenues to the state. This colonial approach continues to shape conservation policies in the Sundarbans.
In Bangladesh, the overall policy and institutional framework disallows coordination, co-governance, or sharing of the co- benefits of water resources. This impacts “social inclusiveness and a balance of economic, environmental, and social factors in the planning, design, and implementation of water resource management” (Chan et al. 2016: 13).
In areas within, and adjacent to the Sundarbans, multiple fishing restrictions have been applied which periodically bar capture fishers from access to water resources. The kind of bans currently operational in the region and the periods in the year they cover are presented in Figure 1.
As a result of these bans, marginalized capture fishers, who are mostly landless, are also compelled to out- migrate periodically in search of alternative livelihoods. Exploring other livelihood opportunities, migrating, and/or ensuring daily subsistence needs requires having to borrow money at high interest rates from local moneylenders. As their incomes from fishing are unreliable, most marginalized capture fishers are highly indebted and entangled in rent-seeking relations with local traders who buy their fish.
Another source of subsistence capture fisheries in the area are freshwater drainage canals, which are tail ends of the many rivers crisscrossing the deltaic area. These canals were reliable, alternative sources for fishing, especially during river fishing ban periods. Under the Government Jolmohol Policy of 2009, sedentary (not free-flowing) common property waterbodies can be leased out to local fishers organized as fishery cooperatives, for a maximum of three years. However, free-flowing water in the canals are regularly leased out

– sometimes for 99 years – to influential individuals for investment in large-scale shrimp farming (Schulze et al. 2024). These leaseholders place strong restrictions on access to canal water.
2. Fisher ID cards and subsidies: Inadequate and inequitable
For two months in a year, the government provides 40 kg of rice per household per month to help mitigate fishing bans (Sayadat et al. 2023). These subsidies are available only for capture fishers who are issued official fisher ID Cards on an annual basis.
Our study found that many legitimate capture fishers do not receive their ID cards, whereas influential non- fishers are able to obtain them. There are also delays in the distribution of the cards, which has led in some years to some 40 per cent of eligible fishers losing their right to subsidies. There have also been reports of some households receiving less than the promised 40 kg per month. The lack of clear guidelines, inadequate monitoring, and inefficiencies in the distribution of ID cards create a system wherein the most vulnerable fishers are consistently marginalized, reinforcing a cycle of inequality and economic marginalization.
to conserve biodiversity by involving local stakeholders in forest management with the Forest Department and ensure better regulation of forest-dependent livelihoods of local communities (Ray et al. 2023). Our findings suggest that these interventions, driven by a top-down approach, did not enable marginalized fishers with the agency or capacity to inform or influence water governance, and restricted their capacity to negotiate or be consulted in policy decisions such as the fishing bans and food subsidy provisions.
Our research also shows that often information regarding the renewal of boat license cards is unclear, and fishers tend to pay significantly more than what is the official rate. A lack of agency and limited knowledge of rights and entitlements result in marginalized fishers paying bribes to officials to gain entry to the Sundarbans, access fishing bodies and resources, and evade imprisonment for violations of fishing bans. These issues underscore the need for more transparent policies and regulatory mechanisms, and informed awareness of marginalized fishers to engage effectively with local government institutions.
5. Challenges in sectoral coordination: Siloed processes in the Fisheries, Forestry, and Environment departments
3. Women fishers: Invisible and unrecognized
In Bangladesh, women actively engage in subsistence fishing and contribute to family income through fishing, with nearly 30 percent of women in rural and coastal Bangladesh involved in the sector (WorldFish 2017). Despite this, they are not fully recognized as fishers and denied access to fisher ID cards, boat licenses and other similar paperwork. Only 4 percent of women fishers in Bangladesh have access to these cards (TBS 2024). Women are also excluded from leasing fishing locations in critical areas like the Haors, Sundarbans, and other wetlands, which are vital for meeting daily food and nutritional needs (TROSA and AMD 2024). These findings reveal a gender bias in institutions, also reflected in the explicit use of the term ‘fisherman’ in policy documents.
4. Fishers and water resource management: Exclusionary decision-making
In 2004, supported by external funders, Bangladesh introduced participatory co-management of forest resources in 21 of the country’s 54 protected areas (NSP 2007; Ray et al. 2023). This approach aimed to promote active collaboration between government authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs), and local stakeholders through forums such as village conservation forums (VCFs). The focus of this co-management approach was
Common pool water resources used for fishing are managed by several authorities, but primarily the Department of Fisheries (DoF). On the other hand, waterbodies within the Sundarbans and nearby areas located in ecologically critical areas (ECAs) are managed by the Forest and Environment departments. The management of freshwater canals lies with local institutional actors. A lack of coordination between these different departments complicates fish-based livelihoods in the region.
6. Lack of transparency in institutional mechanisms and processes
The lack of clarity in regulations, mechanisms, and processes in relation to the issue of boat licensing certificates (BLCs) and fisher ID cards have high costs for marginalized fishers. For example, official fees for BLCs can vary from BDT 10 to BDT 100 (USD 0.08–0.83). Fishers report paying up to BDT 1,500 (USD 12.5) due to bribes and fluid charges. There is also confusion about entry fees into the Sundarbans during restricted periods, as well as fines imposed during fishing bans. Furthermore, fishers face irregularities in entitlements of the food subsidy. What is promised is 40 kg of rice per household, but, as reported to us, without clear guidelines or accountability, fishers are happy if they receive even 25 kg.
December 2024 | Advancing equitable access to common pool water resources for fishers in coastal Bangladesh 4
Opportunities and actions for fishers’ equitable access to resources
{ Guidelines for access: Set clear guidelines for obtaining fisher cards annually, and specify fixed rates for renewing boat licenses. Ensure monitoring of payments and subsidies to prevent corruption and elite capture of resources.
3. Carry out research on fishing bans and expand subsidies
{ Impact assessment of fishing bans: Conduct periodic studies to assess the socio-economic effects of fishing bans on marginalized fishers to enable evidence-based adjustments.
There is an urgent need to address the livelihood vulnerability of capture fishers. Our research highlights the need for more participatory water management, further research on the impact of fishing bans, revision and regulation of food subsidy, and gender-equitable interventions. Additionally, improving coordination across the fisheries, crop, forestry, environment, and related sectors, along with establishing a robust monitoring system for water resources governance, is crucial. These points are explained in detail below:
{ Expanded subsidies: Current subsidies, limited to the 65-day marine fishing ban, are not adequate and need to be expanded, and also improved to ensure more nutritious food options beyond rice to fisher families.
4. Recognize women’s contributions to fisheries
{ Gender-responsive advocacy: Encourage CSOs to promote gender-responsive approaches and advocate for women fishers’ rights in relation to fishing licenses, subsidies, and other interventions.
1. Promote a participatory management approach: Enhancing collaboration
{ Institutional support: Institutions in the fisheries and forest sectors need to recognize women fishers and their contribution to the sector.
{ Involve fisher communities: Involve fisher
{ Involve fisher communities: Involve fisher communities as equal partners in water and other natural resources management, governance, and decision- making. There are examples in Bangladesh of more equal partnerships between local communities and the authorities that can serve as a basis to enhance participatory decision-making and transparency.
{ Strengthen civil society organizations (CSOs): CSOs often serve to inform, educate, and empower marginalized fishers on their rights and agency. Government authorities can work with CSOs to provide a platform for fishers to communicate and advocate for their rights and needs (Mondal et al. 2021).
2. Enhance transparency in information, decisions, and processes
{ Transparent communication: Establish clear,
{ Transparent communication: Establish clear, accessible information systems to inform fishers about regulations, licensing, and eligibility for subsidies. The Sundarbans Management Strategy suggests that formalizing community forums can help reduce misinformation and bribery, leading to a more inclusive governance structure.
5. Improve coordination between sectors and levels through integrated management approaches
{ Sectoral collaboration: Improved coordination between the forest, fisheries, irrigation, land management, and environment departments is essential for sustainable water resources management. A key entry point can be an open platform for sharing data, information, and management plans and aligning these to Sundarbans Ecologically Critical Area (ECA) interventions.
{ Involvement of local bodies: Local government bodies, such as union parishads and subdistrict fishery offices, in partnership with CSOs, play a critical role in issuing fisher ID cards and boat licenses, and providing subsidies. Building capacities and ensuring gender- responsive practices in these institutions can ensure more efficient and equitable outcomes.
6. Establish and operationalize a robust monitoring system
{ Enhanced monitoring mechanisms: Ensure regulation and monitoring of fishing licenses and subsidies and track outcomes and exclusions by enabling coordination between local authorities, CSOs, and marginalized capture fishers.

Highlights
Context
This policy brief presents findings from a review of secondary literature and primary research conducted in Khulna District in southern Bangladesh on the access of coastal fishers to common pool water resources. The study, supported by the CGIAR initiatives – Asian Mega-Deltas (AMD) and Aquatic Foods (AqFI) – and the Transboundary Rivers of South Asia (TROSA) Project, examined the impacts of water resources governance on rural fishers who rely solely on wildlife fishing in freshwater bodies for their livelihood (hereafter referred to as ‘capture fishers’).
Key findings
Fish is a dietary staple in Bangladesh and the Bengali identity is said to be essentially “Maache-bhate Bangali” (A Bengali is essentially fish and rice) (Shamsuzzaman et al. 2017). Bangladesh is home to the world’s largest flooded wetlands and has the third-largest aquatic biodiversity in Asia (Shamsuzzaman et al. 2017). Although, Bangladesh is the third-largest producer of inland fisheries globally (FAO 2022), the potential for a fish-focused economy is not fully realized. Currently, the fisheries sector contributes 3.69 percent to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 22.6 percent to its agricultural GDP (DoF 2017). Inland capture fisheries are vital in Bangladesh, accounting for 83 percent of fish production from freshwater sources, while the remaining 17 percent is accounted for by marine fisheries (Shamsuzzaman et al. 2017).
{ Inland capture fisheries account for 83 percent of fish production in Bangladesh, with capture fisheries contributing 27 percent to overall fish production (DoF 2017). Despite this significant contribution, capture fishers are generally excluded from water resources decision- making, which tends to be crop-centric.
{ Capture fishers are also adversely impacted by legal bans or restrictions on fishing, exercised multiple times during the year. During the year, capture fishers who have been provided official ID cards are entitled to a food subsidy of 40 kilograms (kg) of rice per cardholder household per month for a period of two months. However, these fisher ID cards are issued only to the male head of the household. Additionally, the food subsidies do not cover the multiple bans during the year and are inadequate for meeting household food needs and other living costs. These fishing bans significantly increase the vulnerability of marginalized capture fishers who are mostly landless and
lack alternative livelihoods.
{ Annual fishing bans stipulated in fishery policies and other interventions are designed to protect water resources and fish species. These protection measures do not impact commercial fishery activities, and instead further marginalize capture fishers, whose ecological footprints are disproportionately smaller.
{ This study recommends more participatory and transparent water management and governance, including better coordination between the fisheries, forestry, environment, agriculture, and other relevant water use sectors, and establishing a more representative monitoring system for water resources access, use, and governance. The study also recommends a more critical analysis of the efficacy and implications of currently enforced fishing bans, as well as improved social welfare measures, including the revision of food subsidies and
gender-equitable access to fisher ID cards.
Among those who depend on these inland waterbodies, including rivers, canals, freshwater lakes, and seasonally inundated floodplain wetlands, are large numbers of landless, marginalized capture fishers who rely on fishing as their sole or primary livelihood (Sunny et al. 2020). This fisher community, a key stakeholder in aquatic resources governance, is also one of the most vulnerable and poorest in terms of livelihood security (Rahman and Rahman 2015).
The focus of this study was Khulna District, which is also home to the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forests, with a unique ecological system and declared an UNESCO biodiversity area. We were interested in this region as it houses large numbers of marginalized, landless groups who rely on capture fisheries, including within the boundaries of this biodiversity reserve.
In this region, participatory water resources governance interventions, promoted in Bangladesh since the early 2000s, are often not aligned with environment conservation initiatives. This conflict, impacting the landless, forest- dependent users, is also reported across the country’s fifty-four protected areas (Ray et al. 2023). As a result, participatory approaches are not always implemented and marginalized populations tend to be excluded from natural resources decision-making processes (Irfanullah et al. 2023). It has been reported that in Khulna District too, the needs of small-scale, marginal capture fishers are often overlooked in fisheries, water, and forest management policies and interventions, especially within the boundaries of the Sundarbans (Liyana 2021).
Sustainable management of the Sundarbans is critical. The ecosystem supports biodiversity and local livelihoods and is also a barrier to storm surges intensified by climate change (Hoq 2014). However, conservation policies can fail to consider the balance between ecological sustainability

and socio-economic and political ground realities (Khan and Haque 2010). For marginalized communities, like capture fishers who rely on common pool resources for subsistence livelihoods, there are significant barriers to inclusion (Mondal et al. 2021).
Access to common pool water resources and participation in decision-making
1. Water resources governance, legal restrictions, and the lack of alternative livelihoods
These fishing bans have been reported to result in an increase in hilsa production, but they seriously impact the livelihoods and customary rights of subsistence and marginal fishers (Nahiduzzaman et al. 2018), historically dependent on these waterbodies for their livelihoods. For instance, a recent 65-day ban on fishing in the Bay of Bengal left 70 percent of the fishers unemployed, without any source of income for this entire period. These bans also impact food and nutritional security. In the absence of the ban, around 96 percent of fisher families reported eating three meals a day. This figure dropped to 49 percent during the ban period (Munir 2023). Other than the food subsidy of 40 kgs of rice provided for 2 months during the 65-day ban period, there are no other social protection interventions in place.
The absence of welfare policies often drives some fishers to violate the fishing bans. But such practices are highly risk-prone. For instance, findings show that from 2011–2012 to 2013–2014, local executive courts imposed 2,462 prison sentences and fined marginalized fishers a total of more than BDT 13 million (around USD 107,000) for violating conservation bans.
The centralization of natural resources policies and governance have a colonial history in the sub-continent. Colonial-era policies, dating back to 1878, restricted the access of local communities to the Sundarbans, including its water bodies (Siddique et al. 2023). However, the focus of these colonial policies was not conservation, but to ensure a regular supply of timber and revenues to the state. This colonial approach continues to shape conservation policies in the Sundarbans.
In Bangladesh, the overall policy and institutional framework disallows coordination, co-governance, or sharing of the co- benefits of water resources. This impacts “social inclusiveness and a balance of economic, environmental, and social factors in the planning, design, and implementation of water resource management” (Chan et al. 2016: 13).
In areas within, and adjacent to the Sundarbans, multiple fishing restrictions have been applied which periodically bar capture fishers from access to water resources. The kind of bans currently operational in the region and the periods in the year they cover are presented in Figure 1.
As a result of these bans, marginalized capture fishers, who are mostly landless, are also compelled to out- migrate periodically in search of alternative livelihoods. Exploring other livelihood opportunities, migrating, and/or ensuring daily subsistence needs requires having to borrow money at high interest rates from local moneylenders. As their incomes from fishing are unreliable, most marginalized capture fishers are highly indebted and entangled in rent-seeking relations with local traders who buy their fish.
Another source of subsistence capture fisheries in the area are freshwater drainage canals, which are tail ends of the many rivers crisscrossing the deltaic area. These canals were reliable, alternative sources for fishing, especially during river fishing ban periods. Under the Government Jolmohol Policy of 2009, sedentary (not free-flowing) common property waterbodies can be leased out to local fishers organized as fishery cooperatives, for a maximum of three years. However, free-flowing water in the canals are regularly leased out

– sometimes for 99 years – to influential individuals for investment in large-scale shrimp farming (Schulze et al. 2024). These leaseholders place strong restrictions on access to canal water.
2. Fisher ID cards and subsidies: Inadequate and inequitable
For two months in a year, the government provides 40 kg of rice per household per month to help mitigate fishing bans (Sayadat et al. 2023). These subsidies are available only for capture fishers who are issued official fisher ID Cards on an annual basis.
Our study found that many legitimate capture fishers do not receive their ID cards, whereas influential non- fishers are able to obtain them. There are also delays in the distribution of the cards, which has led in some years to some 40 per cent of eligible fishers losing their right to subsidies. There have also been reports of some households receiving less than the promised 40 kg per month. The lack of clear guidelines, inadequate monitoring, and inefficiencies in the distribution of ID cards create a system wherein the most vulnerable fishers are consistently marginalized, reinforcing a cycle of inequality and economic marginalization.
to conserve biodiversity by involving local stakeholders in forest management with the Forest Department and ensure better regulation of forest-dependent livelihoods of local communities (Ray et al. 2023). Our findings suggest that these interventions, driven by a top-down approach, did not enable marginalized fishers with the agency or capacity to inform or influence water governance, and restricted their capacity to negotiate or be consulted in policy decisions such as the fishing bans and food subsidy provisions.
Our research also shows that often information regarding the renewal of boat license cards is unclear, and fishers tend to pay significantly more than what is the official rate. A lack of agency and limited knowledge of rights and entitlements result in marginalized fishers paying bribes to officials to gain entry to the Sundarbans, access fishing bodies and resources, and evade imprisonment for violations of fishing bans. These issues underscore the need for more transparent policies and regulatory mechanisms, and informed awareness of marginalized fishers to engage effectively with local government institutions.
5. Challenges in sectoral coordination: Siloed processes in the Fisheries, Forestry, and Environment departments
3. Women fishers: Invisible and unrecognized
In Bangladesh, women actively engage in subsistence fishing and contribute to family income through fishing, with nearly 30 percent of women in rural and coastal Bangladesh involved in the sector (WorldFish 2017). Despite this, they are not fully recognized as fishers and denied access to fisher ID cards, boat licenses and other similar paperwork. Only 4 percent of women fishers in Bangladesh have access to these cards (TBS 2024). Women are also excluded from leasing fishing locations in critical areas like the Haors, Sundarbans, and other wetlands, which are vital for meeting daily food and nutritional needs (TROSA and AMD 2024). These findings reveal a gender bias in institutions, also reflected in the explicit use of the term ‘fisherman’ in policy documents.
4. Fishers and water resource management: Exclusionary decision-making
In 2004, supported by external funders, Bangladesh introduced participatory co-management of forest resources in 21 of the country’s 54 protected areas (NSP 2007; Ray et al. 2023). This approach aimed to promote active collaboration between government authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs), and local stakeholders through forums such as village conservation forums (VCFs). The focus of this co-management approach was
Common pool water resources used for fishing are managed by several authorities, but primarily the Department of Fisheries (DoF). On the other hand, waterbodies within the Sundarbans and nearby areas located in ecologically critical areas (ECAs) are managed by the Forest and Environment departments. The management of freshwater canals lies with local institutional actors. A lack of coordination between these different departments complicates fish-based livelihoods in the region.
6. Lack of transparency in institutional mechanisms and processes
The lack of clarity in regulations, mechanisms, and processes in relation to the issue of boat licensing certificates (BLCs) and fisher ID cards have high costs for marginalized fishers. For example, official fees for BLCs can vary from BDT 10 to BDT 100 (USD 0.08–0.83). Fishers report paying up to BDT 1,500 (USD 12.5) due to bribes and fluid charges. There is also confusion about entry fees into the Sundarbans during restricted periods, as well as fines imposed during fishing bans. Furthermore, fishers face irregularities in entitlements of the food subsidy. What is promised is 40 kg of rice per household, but, as reported to us, without clear guidelines or accountability, fishers are happy if they receive even 25 kg.

Opportunities and actions for fishers’ equitable access to resources
{ Guidelines for access: Set clear guidelines for obtaining fisher cards annually, and specify fixed rates for renewing boat licenses. Ensure monitoring of payments and subsidies to prevent corruption and elite capture of resources.
3. Carry out research on fishing bans and expand subsidies
{ Impact assessment of fishing bans: Conduct periodic studies to assess the socio-economic effects of fishing bans on marginalized fishers to enable evidence-based adjustments.
There is an urgent need to address the livelihood vulnerability of capture fishers. Our research highlights the need for more participatory water management, further research on the impact of fishing bans, revision and regulation of food subsidy, and gender-equitable interventions. Additionally, improving coordination across the fisheries, crop, forestry, environment, and related sectors, along with establishing a robust monitoring system for water resources governance, is crucial. These points are explained in detail below:
{ Expanded subsidies: Current subsidies, limited to the 65-day marine fishing ban, are not adequate and need to be expanded, and also improved to ensure more nutritious food options beyond rice to fisher families.
4. Recognize women’s contributions to fisheries
{ Gender-responsive advocacy: Encourage CSOs to promote gender-responsive approaches and advocate for women fishers’ rights in relation to fishing licenses, subsidies, and other interventions.
1. Promote a participatory management approach: Enhancing collaboration
{ Institutional support: Institutions in the fisheries and forest sectors need to recognize women fishers and their contribution to the sector.
{ Involve fisher communities: Involve fisher
{ Involve fisher communities: Involve fisher communities as equal partners in water and other natural resources management, governance, and decision- making. There are examples in Bangladesh of more equal partnerships between local communities and the authorities that can serve as a basis to enhance participatory decision-making and transparency.
{ Strengthen civil society organizations (CSOs): CSOs often serve to inform, educate, and empower marginalized fishers on their rights and agency. Government authorities can work with CSOs to provide a platform for fishers to communicate and advocate for their rights and needs (Mondal et al. 2021).
2. Enhance transparency in information, decisions, and processes
{ Transparent communication: Establish clear,
{ Transparent communication: Establish clear, accessible information systems to inform fishers about regulations, licensing, and eligibility for subsidies. The Sundarbans Management Strategy suggests that formalizing community forums can help reduce misinformation and bribery, leading to a more inclusive governance structure.
5. Improve coordination between sectors and levels through integrated management approaches
{ Sectoral collaboration: Improved coordination between the forest, fisheries, irrigation, land management, and environment departments is essential for sustainable water resources management. A key entry point can be an open platform for sharing data, information, and management plans and aligning these to Sundarbans Ecologically Critical Area (ECA) interventions.
{ Involvement of local bodies: Local government bodies, such as union parishads and subdistrict fishery offices, in partnership with CSOs, play a critical role in issuing fisher ID cards and boat licenses, and providing subsidies. Building capacities and ensuring gender- responsive practices in these institutions can ensure more efficient and equitable outcomes.
6. Establish and operationalize a robust monitoring system
{ Enhanced monitoring mechanisms: Ensure regulation and monitoring of fishing licenses and subsidies and track outcomes and exclusions by enabling coordination between local authorities, CSOs, and marginalized capture fishers.

Session rationale
Livestock assumes a crucial role in household and national economies, contributing up to 40 per cent of agricultural GDP in some cases (World Bank, 2009). Livestock’s contribution varies from supplying food and manure to offering essential draft power for crop cultivation. In developing countries, smallholder farmers often use livestock as a tangible store of wealth, thereby enhancing their economic resilience. However, animal disease, poor management practices, and fragmented markets usually constrain production. As the world’s population continues to rise, animal-sourced food consumption has shown the potential to deliver nutritional benefits to vulnerable demographic groups, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
The complexities of livestock production necessitate unique considerations (relative to crop commodities) when modelling herd dynamics and their interactions with economic and environmental systems. Those considerations span from reproductive behaviours and lifecycle stages to disease dynamics, feed management, climate variability, and economic viability. In the past decades, various approaches have gained prominence in characterizing livestock systems and trying to incorporate these associated challenges. Those models typically assess how on-farm management affects production growth and producer revenues. Livestock prices may be viewed as static or determined by external factors. Another category comprises multimarket partial (Bahta et al., 2021) and general equilibrium models (RIAPA), which incorporate livestock value chains, respectively, as a distinct sector or interdependently with other segments of the entire economy. Each of these employed approaches allows for scenario specifications and implementations, facilitating cost-effective policy interventions.
This session will address some of the recent innovations made in livestock sector modeling and highlight how they can better evaluate the threats confronting livestock populations, market access, livelihoods, and economic growth. The session will draw from and synthesize research from seven studies conducted across various countries using a range of complementary modeling approaches. The studies highlight obstacles in livestock production, ranging from vulnerabilities to animal diseases to climate-induced shocks such as droughts and fluctuations in feed availability. These models aim to improve the policy planning process, helping policymakers identify relevant investment options and animal health interventions (vaccination, quarantine, surveillance), enabling policies and giving guidance to stakeholders in the various livestock chains on appropriate management and marketing that raise resilience.
An innovation of the session will be the use of a tradeshow format to disseminate modeling and research findings (Kaner, 2014). Each of the presenting groups will be distributed across four stations dedicated to a specific thematic livestock modeling approach. These include (1) an integrated herd/epidemiology model with a country- level multimarket partial equilibrium model; (2) applications of the global multimarket partial equilibrium model IMPACT to livestock sector dynamics; (3) a linked animal systems and economywide model; (4) and the use of system dynamics modeling to integrate production, economic, epidemiology, and environmental components. Each station will feature one or more studies presented as posters and a laptop computer set up with user-friendly interfaces of the different models to allow participants to use and interrogate each model actively. The session will begin with a brief 30-minute segment where each group will give a 5-minute oral overview of their model’s structure, approaches, and scenarios. PowerPoint slides are not required; the posters will be projected during these presentations. Following this, participants will have 60 minutes to rotate between stations every 15 minutes, actively engaging in constructing hypothetical scenarios facilitated by the presentation team to test model outcomes and identify potential interventions. While the scenario-building may align with the research's primary objective, both presenters and the audience will have the flexibility to discuss prospective new research applications collaboratively, establish new objectives and build new scenarios.
Station 1: Country-level multimarket partial equilibrium modes
Poster 1. Foot-and-mouth disease incidence on cattle-driven food production and consumption in Rwanda
This study uses a simulated herd dynamics model of the Rwandan cattle population and its interaction with consumer demand to project potential shifts in equilibrium supply, demand, and prices resulting from demographic scenarios and disease shocks from the foot-and-mouth disease that reduce animal productivity and increase animal morbidity and mortality. Unlike previous approaches, the model highlights feedback between cattle dynamics (as influenced by price signals and decisions to sell, hold, or breed animals), disease dynamics how producer management behaviours accentuate or mitigate disease spread, and changes in consumer demand. Simulations include foot- and-mouth disease climate-related shocks, as well as scenarios featuring different population and income levels to assess their potential impacts on the aggregate demand for cattle products and resulting equilibrium prices.

Poster 2. Exploring the socioeconomic impact of female sexed artificial insemination on farmers in Tanzania: A Sector Modeling Approach
This research article examines the effect of female-sexed artificial insemination (AI) on the socio-economic landscape of farmers, with a particular focus on income derived from livestock and associated by-products. The study employs a synergistic approach, utilizing two dynamic models to analyze the multifaceted effects comprehensively. The Dynmod model (Lesnoff, 2008) captures the sophisticated dynamics of herd management over time, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the evolving composition of cattle populations. Complementing this, the partial equilibrium model, alternatively referred to as the multimarket model or sector model, analyses the economic dynamics involved. This dual-model methodology enables a holistic assessment of the long-term implications of adopting female-sexed artificial insemination practices into livestock management. By exploring not only the immediate economic outcomes but also the broader socioeconomic implications, this research contributes valuable insights for farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders interested in promoting sustainable and economically viable practices within the agricultural sector.

Poster 3. The future of poultry and maize markets in southern Africa under climate change
As demand increases for livestock-derived food products, calls have increased for enhanced regional trade between countries with well-developed livestock markets and supply chains, and others. Assessments are, however, needed to quantify the roles of such livestock markets and trade. This includes the context of competition between the demand for crops such as food and feed. This study contributes to the discussion with its use of a modeling framework that links the global model IMPACT (Robinson et al., 2015) with a spatial equilibrium, regional multi- market model (Bahta et al., 2021) to analyze the potential interactions of poultry and maize (food and feed) markets in the context of a rapidly growing demand for poultry products in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia. The study’s abstraction of a regional approach to livestock and feed sector interactions in the selected region highlights the role of markets in addressing cross-boundary challenges related to food demand expansion and resource management. The study’s findings imply that countries could benefit from addressing growing demands for livestock-derived foods using a harmonized approach. Further, regional livestock markets offer cushioning effects to the impacts of climate change in at least one of the countries.

Poster 4. Modeling crop-livestock interactions in semi-subsistence economies under weather shocks
Mixed crop-livestock systems dominate farming, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and are predominant contributors to livelihoods. These systems are the primary recipients of the effects of climate change, and interaction between them makes the impacts considerable and irreversible. However, the speed of recovery from a climate shock varies between these systems, although the dynamics of recovery and the impact of their close interaction on the recovery dynamics are not yet well-researched. In addition, there are various ways in which these systems may adapt to climate change and be climate resilient, including measures targeting the crop sector or the livestock sector. Crop sector interventions could promote drought-resistant varieties and adapt modern farming practices. The livestock sector could adapt through selective breeding and herd size management practices. Using the version of the Linked Economy and Animal Systems (LEAS) model 1 that incorporates environmental and climate change factors into its forage supply function and that reflects animal traction as a capital factor in the crop sector, this study evaluates (i) crop-livestock interactions in a typical developing economy, taking the case of Ethiopia as example, in the context of weather shocks and (ii) the importance of various crop and livestock adaptation strategies in terms of their impacts on sustaining farm incomes, food security, and welfare. The model is calibrated for the five agroecological zones in Ethiopia.

Poster 5. Assessment of vaccination impact in PPR-Control programme implemented southern states in India: A System Dynamics Model Approach
In India, Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) poses a significant threat to sheep and goat populations, prompting mass vaccination initiatives in states like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Despite a notable decline in outbreaks post-vaccination, sporadic occurrences persist due to the constant movement of animals across states for grazing and trade. This study employs a System model to assess PPR's impact, considering both local and external factors. Mass vaccination in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh has substantially reduced outbreaks, resulting in decreased PPR-related mortality and morbidity. The surveyed states exhibit a PPR incidence of <4%, attributing this to vaccination efforts. Economic losses, including mortality costs and treatment expenses, range from USD 35.1- 108.1 in Andhra Pradesh and USD 40.5-189.2 in Karnataka. The projected losses for 2021-22 stand at USD 26.30 million and USD 22.86 million in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively. The result highlights the benefits of high vaccination coverage in increasing flock size and offtakes and reducing infected and death cases. Coordinated inter-state vaccination efforts emerge as crucial for minimizing outbreaks.

Poster 6. Modelling the carbon and economic dynamics in livestock systems in Tanzania
Livestock production in Tanzania predominantly adheres to traditional methods, especially for ruminants, aligning with domestic demand rooted in traditional value chains. Opportunities for value chain upgrading emerge, particularly in leather production, along with the potential for expanded productivity in milk and ruminant meat. However, considering the high climate impact of these activities, understanding carbon dynamics and emissions is imperative. This study assesses productivity and value-added potential in various livestock value chains based on existing research. Furthermore, we propose integrating a concept for modeling carbon dynamics into an economic value-chain model collaboratively with researchers and experts. This initial step aims to develop a model allowing scenario creation and facilitating ""what-if"" analyses for potential value chain transformation scenarios.

Poster 7. Unveiling the dynamics of poultry farm interventions on antimicrobial use in Senegal: A System Dynamics Approach
We employ a System Dynamics approach to model the consequences of poultry farm-level practices related to animal disease prevention and response, focusing on antimicrobial use and productivity. The model targets smallholder farms typical in Senegal and encompasses the dynamics of layer and broiler systems, the acquisition of day-old chicks, vaccination cycles (or lack thereof), the sale of grown chicken and eggs, as well as an accounting of farm profits and costs dependent on production levels and flock size. The model incorporates disease spread, interventions in response to disease, and the dynamics between these elements. Various interventions are tested, including different vaccination regimes and responses to disease outbreaks (limited antimicrobial treatment,
widespread antimicrobial treatment, hygiene intervention without antimicrobial treatment, and no response). The model's results quantitatively assess antimicrobial use under these scenarios and measure their effects on poultry mortality and farm productivity, providing valuable insights for on-farm decision-making and policy guidance.

Session rationale
Livestock assumes a crucial role in household and national economies, contributing up to 40 per cent of agricultural GDP in some cases (World Bank, 2009). Livestock’s contribution varies from supplying food and manure to offering essential draft power for crop cultivation. In developing countries, smallholder farmers often use livestock as a tangible store of wealth, thereby enhancing their economic resilience. However, animal disease, poor management practices, and fragmented markets usually constrain production. As the world’s population continues to rise, animal-sourced food consumption has shown the potential to deliver nutritional benefits to vulnerable demographic groups, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
The complexities of livestock production necessitate unique considerations (relative to crop commodities) when modelling herd dynamics and their interactions with economic and environmental systems. Those considerations span from reproductive behaviours and lifecycle stages to disease dynamics, feed management, climate variability, and economic viability. In the past decades, various approaches have gained prominence in characterizing livestock systems and trying to incorporate these associated challenges. Those models typically assess how on-farm management affects production growth and producer revenues. Livestock prices may be viewed as static or determined by external factors. Another category comprises multimarket partial (Bahta et al., 2021) and general equilibrium models (RIAPA), which incorporate livestock value chains, respectively, as a distinct sector or interdependently with other segments of the entire economy. Each of these employed approaches allows for scenario specifications and implementations, facilitating cost-effective policy interventions.
This session will address some of the recent innovations made in livestock sector modeling and highlight how they can better evaluate the threats confronting livestock populations, market access, livelihoods, and economic growth. The session will draw from and synthesize research from seven studies conducted across various countries using a range of complementary modeling approaches. The studies highlight obstacles in livestock production, ranging from vulnerabilities to animal diseases to climate-induced shocks such as droughts and fluctuations in feed availability. These models aim to improve the policy planning process, helping policymakers identify relevant investment options and animal health interventions (vaccination, quarantine, surveillance), enabling policies and giving guidance to stakeholders in the various livestock chains on appropriate management and marketing that raise resilience.
An innovation of the session will be the use of a tradeshow format to disseminate modeling and research findings (Kaner, 2014). Each of the presenting groups will be distributed across four stations dedicated to a specific thematic livestock modeling approach. These include (1) an integrated herd/epidemiology model with a country- level multimarket partial equilibrium model; (2) applications of the global multimarket partial equilibrium model IMPACT to livestock sector dynamics; (3) a linked animal systems and economywide model; (4) and the use of system dynamics modeling to integrate production, economic, epidemiology, and environmental components. Each station will feature one or more studies presented as posters and a laptop computer set up with user-friendly interfaces of the different models to allow participants to use and interrogate each model actively. The session will begin with a brief 30-minute segment where each group will give a 5-minute oral overview of their model’s structure, approaches, and scenarios. PowerPoint slides are not required; the posters will be projected during these presentations. Following this, participants will have 60 minutes to rotate between stations every 15 minutes, actively engaging in constructing hypothetical scenarios facilitated by the presentation team to test model outcomes and identify potential interventions. While the scenario-building may align with the research's primary objective, both presenters and the audience will have the flexibility to discuss prospective new research applications collaboratively, establish new objectives and build new scenarios.
Station 1: Country-level multimarket partial equilibrium modes
Poster 1. Foot-and-mouth disease incidence on cattle-driven food production and consumption in Rwanda
This study uses a simulated herd dynamics model of the Rwandan cattle population and its interaction with consumer demand to project potential shifts in equilibrium supply, demand, and prices resulting from demographic scenarios and disease shocks from the foot-and-mouth disease that reduce animal productivity and increase animal morbidity and mortality. Unlike previous approaches, the model highlights feedback between cattle dynamics (as influenced by price signals and decisions to sell, hold, or breed animals), disease dynamics how producer management behaviours accentuate or mitigate disease spread, and changes in consumer demand. Simulations include foot- and-mouth disease climate-related shocks, as well as scenarios featuring different population and income levels to assess their potential impacts on the aggregate demand for cattle products and resulting equilibrium prices.

Poster 2. Exploring the socioeconomic impact of female sexed artificial insemination on farmers in Tanzania: A Sector Modeling Approach
This research article examines the effect of female-sexed artificial insemination (AI) on the socio-economic landscape of farmers, with a particular focus on income derived from livestock and associated by-products. The study employs a synergistic approach, utilizing two dynamic models to analyze the multifaceted effects comprehensively. The Dynmod model (Lesnoff, 2008) captures the sophisticated dynamics of herd management over time, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the evolving composition of cattle populations. Complementing this, the partial equilibrium model, alternatively referred to as the multimarket model or sector model, analyses the economic dynamics involved. This dual-model methodology enables a holistic assessment of the long-term implications of adopting female-sexed artificial insemination practices into livestock management. By exploring not only the immediate economic outcomes but also the broader socioeconomic implications, this research contributes valuable insights for farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders interested in promoting sustainable and economically viable practices within the agricultural sector.

1. Background
This manual discusses the extension of the dynamic DynMod model in GAMS to include an environmental component. DynMod is a simple herd growth model spreadsheet that simulates the population dynamics of ruminant livestock herds (Lesnoff 2008). The first part of the model developed in 2021 replicates the DynMod methodology of Lesnoff (2008) in a GAMS format, using data from the Livestock sector investment and policy toolkit (LSIPT), the livestock sector investment and policy toolkit (FAO, CIRAD, and ILRI 2020). Based on a series of calculations specified using Microsoft Office Excel, the original DynMod spreadsheet model could be used to derive the number of animals produced over a given period (e.g., a year), population-specific animal live weights, and the production of various livestock products, e.g., meat, milk, hides and skin, and manure. These are derived based on user-specified characteristics of the herd (such as fertility and mortality rates) and can be further linked to resource use indicators such as herd-level feed requirements and costs, and financial indicators such as costs of production.
Specification of DynMod in Excel had limited ability to incorporate dynamic economic considerations (e.g., changing prices) in management decisions such as offtakes that influence overall herd dynamics. Also of note was the cumbersome process of manipulating numerous lines and pages of formula in Excel to execute the herd dynamics, which made it difficult to implement appropriate scenario analysis, and it lent itself to a high number of data and specification errors. Re- specifying the model using a flexible mathematical programing software such as GAMS was a step to addressing these challenges. A model converting DynMod’s original specification in Excel to GAMS was reported in the ILRI manual by Punt et al. (2021). The accompanying model specifications and data files to execute this process were made available on ILRI’s open data portal.1
The next step was to link DynMod to a partial equilibrium model, to give the SectorM model. This was done by 2021 and is documented in ‘Report on linking the Dynmod model to the Sector model’.
The most recent development is the linking of DynMod to an environmental component based on the static CLEANED environmental spreadsheet model by Mwema et al. (2024). The linked model in GAMS is called DynModE. The linking of the model is discussed in more detail in this document. The accompanying model specifications and data files to execute this process are made available on ILRI’s open data portal.2
2. The CLEANED model
According to Mukiri et al. (2019) the CLEANED tool assesses the environmental impacts of livestock production systems along a value chain. The boundary for assessment extends to all the inputs needed to sustain the livestock enterprise but not the whole farm.
The livestock enterprise refers to the following:
o Livestock numbers and production
o Animal manure management
o Feed basket including area used to grow feed items, grasses as well as crop residues and grazing fields

2 Link to DynModE model and data here, unrestricted access after April 2025.
o Inputs required for livestock enterprise
The environmental footprint of a livestock enterprise is calculated, in terms of: -
o The feed required based on the number of livestock and their productivity
o The area of land required for feed production
o Production
o Soil impacts based on types of feed produced and area under production:
- Erosion
- N balance
o GHG emissions from enteric fermentation, feed production, and manure management
o Water impacts based on feed area under production
o Soil carbon stock
The file CLEANED X5.xlsm contains the static version of CLEANED in Excel. The Excel file together with the technical specification document by Mwema et al. (2024) was used as base for the GAMS version of the environmental model called DynModE. The GAMS version of the model is dynamic insofar as dynamic herd numbers from DynMod are used in the calculation of the environmental impacts. Also, the simulations allow for the values of any of the parameters to be changed for any years during the twenty year simulation period.
3. Sequence of files
The current environmental extension, DynModE, can be run after DynMod. The model folder in the repository contains the original DynMod model files plus the new DynModE files in the same folder. The main DynModE Gams file (X1DynE_Main.gms) is run after the DynMod file. The only adjustment to the DynMod files compared to the 2021 version is the addition of the following include statement at the very end of the main DynMod Gams file (2DynModCPv2.gms) in order to activate the DynModE file:
$INCLUDE X1DynE_Main.gms
Thus, current users of DynMod, who may have made changes to DynMod, can retain their own versions of DynMod and copy only the new files starting with X into their existing DynMod folder and then just add the above GAMS command at the end of the main DynMod Gams file (2DynModCPv2.gms).
The main DynModE GAMS file (X1DynE_Main.gms), automatically activates several files. The included files are modular and must be run in sequence. After including files, a results file (XDynE_Results.gms) is automatically run. However, initial files can be run without subsequent files being included. This allows for more systematic changes and checking of different components of the model. Note that the results file can only be activated if all the included files are activated as it contains results from all the included files.
The DynMod files are listed in sequence in Table 1 for ease of reference and new DynModE files are listed in sequence in Table 2.

The main gms file (X1DynE_Main.gms) maps the DynMod production systems for ruminants to the CLEANED animal categories that are used for environmental calculations to obtain herd dynamics over time for the CLEANED animal categories. Different sets used in DynModE and required
mappings between various sets are read in via an include file (X1DynE-Sets.inc). The main DynModE file allows for a choice of either linking the DynMod animal numbers over time according to different production systems to the environmental calculations; or alternatively any number of animals for a specific year can be included for the environmental calculations. In the latter instance when animal numbers for one year is provided DynModE will still present results over the 20 year simulation period (as determined in DynMod), but the results will remain constant over the 20 years in the simulation period. Besides the herd numbers over time, the parturition rates that are used in the calculation of these herd numbers are also used in DynModE (in XDynE_2FeedReq.inc). In the main DynModE Gams file the parturition rates are also mapped as averages from the DynMod production systems to animal categories used in the environmental calculations.
A single Excel file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx) is used to capture all environmental data for livestock, feed, crops and soil. The data is however not imported all at once, but imported when required for the calculations in each of the different include files. After importing the data, the data for SIM2 and SIM3 are set equal to that of SIM1 for all the parameters. Changes in parameters for SIM2 and SIM3 are then set in separate include files before the calculations are carried out. The simulations are discussed in more detail in section 4.5.
There are nine files included for different categories of calculations.
The first include file (XDynE_1FeedQual.inc) presents feed characteristics for the estimation of the feed basket quality, and specification of the feed basket (feed basket fractions). This include file calls in a simulation file (XDynE_1FeedQualSim.inc) which can be used to change the composition of the feed basket, which will impact the feed and land requirements in the next two include files. It reads data from the Feed and Feedfrc worksheets in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.1 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The second included file (XDynE_2FeedReq.inc) estimates the metabolic energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) requirements of different animals and then determines how much feed is required. It reads data from the ReqMECP worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.2 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The third file (XDynE_3LandReq.inc) estimates the land required to produce crops for the various feed items. It reads data from the ReqLnd worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.3 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The fourth file (XDynE_4Productivity.inc) estimates indicators of productivity in terms of the output of animal products produced. Animal products include meat, milk and manure. Although similar outputs were calculated in DynMod, the quantities produced per animal is very different from the inputs in CLEANED X5.xlsm. For purposes of DynModE, the quantities of product per animal in CLEANED X5.xlsm were used. This file reads data from the Prod worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.4 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The fifth include file (XDynE_5SoilErosion.inc) estimates soil erosion. It reads data from the Soil worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). This file calls in a simulation file (XDynE_5SoilErosionSIM.inc) which can be used to change the rainfall in different years, which will impact the level of soil erosion, as well as the nitrogen balance and water requirements per crop, which is calculated in the sixth and seventh include files respectively. It is based on section 1.6 from Mwema et al. (2024). Some of the soil erosion results are used in the calculation of the nitrogen balance, hence this include file precedes the include file that calculates the nitrogen balance.
The sixth file (XDynE_6Nitrogen.inc) estimates nitrogen inputs and outputs and the nitrogen balance. Four types of nitrogen inputs and five types of nitrogen outputs are estimated. It reads data from the Nitrogen worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.5 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The seventh file (XDynE_7Water.inc) estimates water requirements for crop production. It reads data from the Water worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.7 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The eighth file (XDynE_8GHG.inc) estimates greenhouse gas emissions. It reads data from the GHG worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.8 from Mwema et al. (2024). The formulae and coefficients for most of the GHG calculations as contained in the CLEANED model was based on the report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC ,2019).
The ninth file (XDynE_9Carbon.inc) estimates carbon stock changes. It reads data from the Carbon worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.9 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The final GAMS file (XDynE_Results.gms) is used to write results to GDX (GAMS file type) and to Excel. It is included at the end of the main DynModE gms file and can be deactivated using an asterisk. With the ‘execute_unload command, all the parameters listed will be downloaded into a GDX file. With the first ‘execute’ command all parameter results in the GDX file are written to Excel file XDynE_ResultsAll.xlsx. Most of the results parameters (i.e. not all imported data parameters) were included here. Users can however decide what to include or exclude, but the aim is to capture all results. The results are automatically captured alphabetically and a table of contents is automatically created. Results (all worksheets) are replaced with each run of the model, as well as any calculations that were done in the file. In order to use this file for custom tables or figures, a copy of the file should first be saved under a different name to avoid replacement when the model is run again. With the second ‘execute’ command only selected (user defined) results are written to Excel file XDynE_ResultsOwn.xlsx. The information in the index sheet in this Excel file determines the placement of the results in the workbook. This allows the user to link these results to additional sheets in order to set up result tables and figures for reports. The model can thus be rerun and the results in the Excel file will be updated without losing the table and figure layout. Users need to customize this Excel file to include the desired results in this file. Enough rows should be left open between the different parameters when the data positions are specified in the index sheet. Note that all Excel files (for data and results) must be closed when running the model to avoid error messages.
4. Sets  
The following sections explain the sets introduced in DynModE. Some of the key sets from DynMod are also repeated here for ease of reference.
4.1 Sets for animal categories un DynModE
The set for animals is defined as R, with subsets for each main category of animals:
R animal categories for environmental considerations
RBOV Bovine (cattle) ruminant categories in CLEANED
RBUF Buffalo ruminant categories in CLEANED
ROVI Ovine (sheep) ruminant categories in CLEANED
RGTS Goats ruminant categories in CLEANED
RPIG Pig categories in CLEANED - monogastric thus not in DynMod for ruminants
RCAM Camel ruminant categories in CLEANED
The list of animals within each category is included in Table 3.

4.2 DynMod sets and mapping to DynModE sets
The sets listed below are the key DynMod sets that influence the DynModE results. These sets are mentioned here for ease of reference, but they are not declared again in DynModE. These and other sets from DynMod can be found in the ILRITanzania-Sets.inc which is read in using the main gms file for DynMod (2DynModCPv2.gms).
PS global production system set that includes all possible base (PSBASE) and simulation productions systems (PSSIM).
Y Annual time periods for simulation ranging from Y0 to chosen year (which should be selected in DynMod)
A Age classes
DynMod estimates the herd numbers per age group (Table 4) per production system (Table 5) over time. These herd numbers are used as starting point for the environmental results in DynModE in the linked model.

Table 9 in the appendix indicates how the DynMod ruminant age classes (A) per production systems (PS) were mapped to DynModE animal categories (R). The set that contains this mapping is as follows:
MDC(R,A,PS) Mapping of DynMod age classes (A) and production system (PS) combinations to CLEANED animal categories (R)
This mapping set (MDC) is read in from the Excel data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx) with the sets include file (X1DynE-Sets.inc). When users apply DynModE to their own regions, this mapping will need to be updated and checked meticulously. The command to map the DynMod herd numbers over time to the CLEANED animal categories is found in the main DynModE file (X1DynE_Main.gms). All environmental calculations are based on the CLEANED animal categories in set R listed in Table 3.
Other mappings that were used in the main DynModE file (X1DynE_Main.gms) for the linking of the DynMod herd numbers and parturition rates to DynModE animal categories can be found in the Excel data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx) and include the following:
MDCF(R,PS) Mapping of DynMod age classes (A) and production system (PS) combinations to CLEANED animal categories (R) for female adults only, for parturition rates
MRRS(RBASE,RSIM) categories RSIM
Mapping of base animal categories RBASE to simulation
MRSR(RSIM,RBASE) Mapping of simulation animal categories RSIM to base categories RBASE
MPSPB(PSSIM,PSBASE) Mapping of simulation production systems PSSIM to base production systems PSBASE
4.3 Sets for crops and feed items in DynModE
The 53 crops currently included in the environmental model dataset, as obtained from CLEANED, can be seen in Table 6. Crops can be used as various feed items. From the 53 crops there are 131 associated feed items (see Table 7). There are also two mapping sets to indicate which feed item is associated with which crop. The details of the two mapping sets are not included here, but can be found in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx).

4.4 Other ad hoc sets in DynModE
A few other sets are used in some of the include files:
G Gas (e.g. CO2, CO, N2O, etc.) in XDynE_8GHG.inc
FERT Fertiliser (e.g. Urea, NPK, DAP, etc.) in XDynE_8GHG.inc
Soil cover types (e.g. cereals, legumes/pulses, grass) in XDynE_5SoilErosion.inc
MCOVC(COV,C) Mapping of soil cover type (COV) to crop (C)
4.5 Simulations and simulation sets
In DynMod there are two sets of production systems, one set for the base and one set for the simulations. Simulation production systems are declared and initialized at base values in the files mentioned in Table 1, because initially the same data is read in from the country specific data file (ILRITanzania-data.xlsx) for both the base production systems and the simulation production systems.
Simulations are activated by changing base values of the simulation production systems in three country specific simulation files (ILRITanzania-Sim","A manual on DynModE in GAMS: an environmental extension to DynMod  The following text section comes from a specific evidence file named URL https://hdl.handle.net/10568/172506: ""A manual on DynModE in GAMS: an environmental extension to DynMod Skip to main content Communities & Collections Browse Navigate CGIAR Centers Statistics English Catal e tina Deutsch Espa ol Fran ais G idhlig Italiano Latvie u Magyar Nederlands Polski Portugu s Portugu s do Brasil Srpski (lat) Suomi Svenska T rk e Ti ng Vi t Y Log In Note: CGIAR users should log in with their Active Directory username and password.

1. Background
This manual discusses the extension of the dynamic DynMod model in GAMS to include an environmental component. DynMod is a simple herd growth model spreadsheet that simulates the population dynamics of ruminant livestock herds (Lesnoff 2008). The first part of the model developed in 2021 replicates the DynMod methodology of Lesnoff (2008) in a GAMS format, using data from the Livestock sector investment and policy toolkit (LSIPT), the livestock sector investment and policy toolkit (FAO, CIRAD, and ILRI 2020). Based on a series of calculations specified using Microsoft Office Excel, the original DynMod spreadsheet model could be used to derive the number of animals produced over a given period (e.g., a year), population-specific animal live weights, and the production of various livestock products, e.g., meat, milk, hides and skin, and manure. These are derived based on user-specified characteristics of the herd (such as fertility and mortality rates) and can be further linked to resource use indicators such as herd-level feed requirements and costs, and financial indicators such as costs of production.
Specification of DynMod in Excel had limited ability to incorporate dynamic economic considerations (e.g., changing prices) in management decisions such as offtakes that influence overall herd dynamics. Also of note was the cumbersome process of manipulating numerous lines and pages of formula in Excel to execute the herd dynamics, which made it difficult to implement appropriate scenario analysis, and it lent itself to a high number of data and specification errors. Re- specifying the model using a flexible mathematical programing software such as GAMS was a step to addressing these challenges. A model converting DynMod’s original specification in Excel to GAMS was reported in the ILRI manual by Punt et al. (2021). The accompanying model specifications and data files to execute this process were made available on ILRI’s open data portal.1
The next step was to link DynMod to a partial equilibrium model, to give the SectorM model. This was done by 2021 and is documented in ‘Report on linking the Dynmod model to the Sector model’.
The most recent development is the linking of DynMod to an environmental component based on the static CLEANED environmental spreadsheet model by Mwema et al. (2024). The linked model in GAMS is called DynModE. The linking of the model is discussed in more detail in this document. The accompanying model specifications and data files to execute this process are made available on ILRI’s open data portal.2
2. The CLEANED model
According to Mukiri et al. (2019) the CLEANED tool assesses the environmental impacts of livestock production systems along a value chain. The boundary for assessment extends to all the inputs needed to sustain the livestock enterprise but not the whole farm.
The livestock enterprise refers to the following:
o Livestock numbers and production
o Animal manure management
o Feed basket including area used to grow feed items, grasses as well as crop residues and grazing fields

2 Link to DynModE model and data here, unrestricted access after April 2025.
o Inputs required for livestock enterprise
The environmental footprint of a livestock enterprise is calculated, in terms of: -
o The feed required based on the number of livestock and their productivity
o The area of land required for feed production
o Production
o Soil impacts based on types of feed produced and area under production:
- Erosion
- N balance
o GHG emissions from enteric fermentation, feed production, and manure management
o Water impacts based on feed area under production
o Soil carbon stock
The file CLEANED X5.xlsm contains the static version of CLEANED in Excel. The Excel file together with the technical specification document by Mwema et al. (2024) was used as base for the GAMS version of the environmental model called DynModE. The GAMS version of the model is dynamic insofar as dynamic herd numbers from DynMod are used in the calculation of the environmental impacts. Also, the simulations allow for the values of any of the parameters to be changed for any years during the twenty year simulation period.
3. Sequence of files
The current environmental extension, DynModE, can be run after DynMod. The model folder in the repository contains the original DynMod model files plus the new DynModE files in the same folder. The main DynModE Gams file (X1DynE_Main.gms) is run after the DynMod file. The only adjustment to the DynMod files compared to the 2021 version is the addition of the following include statement at the very end of the main DynMod Gams file (2DynModCPv2.gms) in order to activate the DynModE file:
$INCLUDE X1DynE_Main.gms
Thus, current users of DynMod, who may have made changes to DynMod, can retain their own versions of DynMod and copy only the new files starting with X into their existing DynMod folder and then just add the above GAMS command at the end of the main DynMod Gams file (2DynModCPv2.gms).
The main DynModE GAMS file (X1DynE_Main.gms), automatically activates several files. The included files are modular and must be run in sequence. After including files, a results file (XDynE_Results.gms) is automatically run. However, initial files can be run without subsequent files being included. This allows for more systematic changes and checking of different components of the model. Note that the results file can only be activated if all the included files are activated as it contains results from all the included files.
The DynMod files are listed in sequence in Table 1 for ease of reference and new DynModE files are listed in sequence in Table 2.

The main gms file (X1DynE_Main.gms) maps the DynMod production systems for ruminants to the CLEANED animal categories that are used for environmental calculations to obtain herd dynamics over time for the CLEANED animal categories. Different sets used in DynModE and required
mappings between various sets are read in via an include file (X1DynE-Sets.inc). The main DynModE file allows for a choice of either linking the DynMod animal numbers over time according to different production systems to the environmental calculations; or alternatively any number of animals for a specific year can be included for the environmental calculations. In the latter instance when animal numbers for one year is provided DynModE will still present results over the 20 year simulation period (as determined in DynMod), but the results will remain constant over the 20 years in the simulation period. Besides the herd numbers over time, the parturition rates that are used in the calculation of these herd numbers are also used in DynModE (in XDynE_2FeedReq.inc). In the main DynModE Gams file the parturition rates are also mapped as averages from the DynMod production systems to animal categories used in the environmental calculations.
A single Excel file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx) is used to capture all environmental data for livestock, feed, crops and soil. The data is however not imported all at once, but imported when required for the calculations in each of the different include files. After importing the data, the data for SIM2 and SIM3 are set equal to that of SIM1 for all the parameters. Changes in parameters for SIM2 and SIM3 are then set in separate include files before the calculations are carried out. The simulations are discussed in more detail in section 4.5.
There are nine files included for different categories of calculations.
The first include file (XDynE_1FeedQual.inc) presents feed characteristics for the estimation of the feed basket quality, and specification of the feed basket (feed basket fractions). This include file calls in a simulation file (XDynE_1FeedQualSim.inc) which can be used to change the composition of the feed basket, which will impact the feed and land requirements in the next two include files. It reads data from the Feed and Feedfrc worksheets in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.1 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The second included file (XDynE_2FeedReq.inc) estimates the metabolic energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) requirements of different animals and then determines how much feed is required. It reads data from the ReqMECP worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.2 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The third file (XDynE_3LandReq.inc) estimates the land required to produce crops for the various feed items. It reads data from the ReqLnd worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.3 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The fourth file (XDynE_4Productivity.inc) estimates indicators of productivity in terms of the output of animal products produced. Animal products include meat, milk and manure. Although similar outputs were calculated in DynMod, the quantities produced per animal is very different from the inputs in CLEANED X5.xlsm. For purposes of DynModE, the quantities of product per animal in CLEANED X5.xlsm were used. This file reads data from the Prod worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.4 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The fifth include file (XDynE_5SoilErosion.inc) estimates soil erosion. It reads data from the Soil worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). This file calls in a simulation file (XDynE_5SoilErosionSIM.inc) which can be used to change the rainfall in different years, which will impact the level of soil erosion, as well as the nitrogen balance and water requirements per crop, which is calculated in the sixth and seventh include files respectively. It is based on section 1.6 from Mwema et al. (2024). Some of the soil erosion results are used in the calculation of the nitrogen balance, hence this include file precedes the include file that calculates the nitrogen balance.
The sixth file (XDynE_6Nitrogen.inc) estimates nitrogen inputs and outputs and the nitrogen balance. Four types of nitrogen inputs and five types of nitrogen outputs are estimated. It reads data from the Nitrogen worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.5 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The seventh file (XDynE_7Water.inc) estimates water requirements for crop production. It reads data from the Water worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.7 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The eighth file (XDynE_8GHG.inc) estimates greenhouse gas emissions. It reads data from the GHG worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.8 from Mwema et al. (2024). The formulae and coefficients for most of the GHG calculations as contained in the CLEANED model was based on the report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC ,2019).
The ninth file (XDynE_9Carbon.inc) estimates carbon stock changes. It reads data from the Carbon worksheet in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx). It is based on section 1.9 from Mwema et al. (2024).
The final GAMS file (XDynE_Results.gms) is used to write results to GDX (GAMS file type) and to Excel. It is included at the end of the main DynModE gms file and can be deactivated using an asterisk. With the ‘execute_unload command, all the parameters listed will be downloaded into a GDX file. With the first ‘execute’ command all parameter results in the GDX file are written to Excel file XDynE_ResultsAll.xlsx. Most of the results parameters (i.e. not all imported data parameters) were included here. Users can however decide what to include or exclude, but the aim is to capture all results. The results are automatically captured alphabetically and a table of contents is automatically created. Results (all worksheets) are replaced with each run of the model, as well as any calculations that were done in the file. In order to use this file for custom tables or figures, a copy of the file should first be saved under a different name to avoid replacement when the model is run again. With the second ‘execute’ command only selected (user defined) results are written to Excel file XDynE_ResultsOwn.xlsx. The information in the index sheet in this Excel file determines the placement of the results in the workbook. This allows the user to link these results to additional sheets in order to set up result tables and figures for reports. The model can thus be rerun and the results in the Excel file will be updated without losing the table and figure layout. Users need to customize this Excel file to include the desired results in this file. Enough rows should be left open between the different parameters when the data positions are specified in the index sheet. Note that all Excel files (for data and results) must be closed when running the model to avoid error messages.
4. Sets  
The following sections explain the sets introduced in DynModE. Some of the key sets from DynMod are also repeated here for ease of reference.
4.1 Sets for animal categories un DynModE
The set for animals is defined as R, with subsets for each main category of animals:
R animal categories for environmental considerations
RBOV Bovine (cattle) ruminant categories in CLEANED
RBUF Buffalo ruminant categories in CLEANED
ROVI Ovine (sheep) ruminant categories in CLEANED
RGTS Goats ruminant categories in CLEANED
RPIG Pig categories in CLEANED - monogastric thus not in DynMod for ruminants
RCAM Camel ruminant categories in CLEANED
The list of animals within each category is included in Table 3.
Table 3: Subsets of animals (Subsets of R)

4.2 DynMod sets and mapping to DynModE sets
The sets listed below are the key DynMod sets that influence the DynModE results. These sets are mentioned here for ease of reference, but they are not declared again in DynModE. These and other sets from DynMod can be found in the ILRITanzania-Sets.inc which is read in using the main gms file for DynMod (2DynModCPv2.gms).
PS global production system set that includes all possible base (PSBASE) and simulation productions systems (PSSIM).
Y Annual time periods for simulation ranging from Y0 to chosen year (which should be selected in DynMod)
A Age classes
DynMod estimates the herd numbers per age group (Table 4) per production system (Table 5) over time. These herd numbers are used as starting point for the environmental results in DynModE in the linked model.

Table 9 in the appendix indicates how the DynMod ruminant age classes (A) per production systems (PS) were mapped to DynModE animal categories (R). The set that contains this mapping is as follows:
MDC(R,A,PS) Mapping of DynMod age classes (A) and production system (PS) combinations to CLEANED animal categories (R)
This mapping set (MDC) is read in from the Excel data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx) with the sets include file (X1DynE-Sets.inc). When users apply DynModE to their own regions, this mapping will need to be updated and checked meticulously. The command to map the DynMod herd numbers over time to the CLEANED animal categories is found in the main DynModE file (X1DynE_Main.gms). All environmental calculations are based on the CLEANED animal categories in set R listed in Table 3.
Other mappings that were used in the main DynModE file (X1DynE_Main.gms) for the linking of the DynMod herd numbers and parturition rates to DynModE animal categories can be found in the Excel data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx) and include the following:
MDCF(R,PS) Mapping of DynMod age classes (A) and production system (PS) combinations to CLEANED animal categories (R) for female adults only, for parturition rates
MRRS(RBASE,RSIM) categories RSIM
Mapping of base animal categories RBASE to simulation
MRSR(RSIM,RBASE) Mapping of simulation animal categories RSIM to base categories RBASE
MPSPB(PSSIM,PSBASE) Mapping of simulation production systems PSSIM to base production systems PSBASE
4.3 Sets for crops and feed items in DynModE
The 53 crops currently included in the environmental model dataset, as obtained from CLEANED, can be seen in Table 6. Crops can be used as various feed items. From the 53 crops there are 131 associated feed items (see Table 7). There are also two mapping sets to indicate which feed item is associated with which crop. The details of the two mapping sets are not included here, but can be found in the data file (X1DynE-Data.xlsx).

Introduction
The Village Tank Cascade System (VTCS) is an ancient infrastructure developed over 2,000 years ago, designed to adapt to water scarcity in Sri Lanka's dry zone. The VTCS is primarily used for irrigation in this region. The term ""tank cascade"" refers to a network of interconnected tanks arranged sequentially from higher to lower elevations, allowing for the efficient distribution and storage of water (Panabokke et al., 2002). The Village Tank Cascade Systems (VTCS) in Sri Lanka exemplify a significant framework for water resource management, integrating hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics. This framework is crucial for the sustainable development of rural communities in the dry zone, particularly in the face of increasing climate variability and socio-economic challenges (Melles and Perera, 2020; Mendonce et al., 2024; Ratnayake et al., 2021; Gunasena and Nianthi, 2024; Nanthakumaran et al.,2022).
Over the past few decades, water governance frameworks in Sri Lanka have traditionally focused on rehabilitating individual tanks rather than restoring the entire cascade system (Amarasinghe, 2022; Dharmasena and Bandara, 2009; Hewawasam and Matsui, 2022). This fragmented approach often neglects the interconnected hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics crucial to the system's long-term sustainability. Since independence, the Village Tank Cascade Systems (VTCS) management has been divided among multiple government agencies, leading to overlapping responsibilities and unclear roles (Ariyawanshe et al., 2023; Wijekoon et al., 2016). The top-down approach has often overlooked the needs of local communities, resulting in poor coordination, inefficient water resource management, and the worsening of rural poverty.
As a result of this top-down management mechanism, many village tanks are now experiencing physical degradation, such as silted beds, damaged sluices, and unlined canals, which are often aggravated by encroachment from expanding human settlements and agricultural fields (Aheeyar, 2013; Kekulandala et al., 2024). This physical deterioration of the cascade system negatively impacts agricultural productivity and community livelihoods (Ratnayake et al., 2024; Sirimanna et al., 2022). The cultivable area of small tanks has gradually decreased due to sedimentation and significant water losses, leading to lower cropping intensity in the dry zones. Farmers frequently experience crop failures, particularly during the Yala season. Rural populations in these regions suffer from worsening living conditions due to unreliable water supplies and frequent crop losses. Previous management efforts, which focused primarily on maximizing agricultural output, have largely overlooked the broader social, cultural, and ecological factors essential for long-term sustainability (Senaratne & Scarborough, 2011; Timsina & Weerahewa, 2023). The historical use of tank water for domestic purposes has increasingly been replaced by commercial agricultural practices, leading to significant agrochemical contamination, which now renders tank water unsafe for direct consumption.
The centralization of decision-making processes has resulted in neglecting the Village Tank Cascade System's (VTCS) multifunctional role, with an undue emphasis on agricultural productivity at the expense of other critical functions (Ratnayake et al., 2024; Kekulandala, 2021). Past policies and strategies, particularly in water management and the agricultural sector, have failed to adequately incorporate community input, further exacerbated by insufficient focus on restoring surrounding ecosystems. The lack of a cohesive governance framework for the VTCS has impeded effective rehabilitation efforts.
The Department of Agrarian Development (DAD) delegates the day-to-day operations and maintenance of village tank-based irrigation systems to Farmer Organizations (FOs). In Sri Lanka, FOs function at the local level as community-based water governance bodies, playing a vital role in water management and decision-making. However, FOs are not fully equipped to manage all the functions required for the sustainable management of Village Tank Cascade Systems (VTCS), which are complex resource systems. Their limited scope and membership do not adequately address the broader issues at the cascade level (Kekulandala, 2021; Imbulana et al., 2023)
Therefore, a coordinated governance approach that integrates both ecological restoration and community needs is essential for the sustainable functioning of the VTCS. Additionally, water resource rehabilitation, along with other rural development projects, must prioritize the integrity of the entire cascade system to preserve vital hydrological and ecological linkages. By adopting this holistic approach, we can enhance agricultural productivity, optimize water resource management, and ensure the long-term sustainability of rural communities.

Recent research (Ariyawanshe et al., 2023; Imbulana et al., 2023; Dharmasena, 2020; Harischandra, 2010; Kekulandala, 2021) and project initiatives, such as the Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP https://criwmp.lk/ ), the Climate-Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP https://csiap.lk/), and the Smallholder Agribusiness and Resilience Project (SARP https://www.sarp.lk/si/), have highlighted the importance of managing cascade systems and implementing cascade-level governance to enhance the socio-economic resilience of Village Tank Cascade Systems (VTCS) in Sri Lanka. Establishing a formal coordinating body for VTCS, such as a Cascade Management Committee (CMC), would strengthen local stakeholder engagement and improve policy coherence.
Cascade Management Committees have been established to enhance cooperation and ensure effective VTCS governance. These committees aim to coordinate local communities and stakeholders for the long-term functionality and resilience of tank systems. IWMI, under the Governance for Resilience (G4R) workstream of the CGIAR’s ClimBer research initiative, developed a multiscale polycentric governance tool guide for planning and implementing transformative adaptation interventions to climate change. IWMI’s G4R research in Sri Lanka showed that CMCs are indeed a transformative adaptation option, and an effective management mechanism supported by a multiscale polycentric governance framework is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the CMC and its systemic impacts.
The Department of Agrarian Development (DAD) in Sri Lanka is responsible for managing village tank irrigation systems and supporting farming communities. In August 2023, the DAD issued a circular outlining the establishment of cascade-level governance mechanisms, including the roles and composition of Cascade Management Committees (CMCs). Currently, The DAD is developing strategies to ensure the long-term sustainability and effective operation of CMCs, in collaboration with CRIWMP, CSIAP, and SARP.
In support of this initiative, in October 2024, IWMI conducted write-shops to gather regional stakeholders' perspectives, contributing to the design of an effective policy action plan for the sustainable operation and management of CMCs. Two regional stakeholder write-shops were held with tank cascade-based communities and officials in Nawagaththegama (Northwestern Province) and KovilKulam, Vavuniya (Northern Province). These write- shops gathered stakeholders' insights to develop a policy action plan to ensure the sustainable operation of CMCs, foster rural development, and enhance climate resilience.
Methodology of the study
Review of Existing Literature on Tank Cascade Systems and Governance
A review of existing literature on cascade systems and governance provides a valuable foundation for understanding how these systems function and have been managed over time. This preliminary review offered insights into the historical, environmental, and social dimensions of cascade management.
Review of existing cascade management committee plans
Cascade Management Plans have been developed through recent initiatives, including the Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP) and the Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP). These plans are available for specific cascade systems, such as Babawa, Palugaswewa, and Kapugama. As an outcome of these projects, governance structures for Cascade Management were proposed to support sustainable management practices. At the beginning of this study, a review of these plans and their proposed governance structures was conducted to identify potential areas for strengthening the cascade management committees.
Analysis of Plans and Their Proposed Governance Structures
The analysis aimed to identify similarities, differences, and potential gaps in the approach, resources, governance structures, and outcomes between the two projects. This involved evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, resource allocation, the structure and functioning of the governance frameworks, and how these factors contributed to achieving the intended goals of each project.

Stakeholder Interviews
Interviews were conducted with key officials and stakeholders involved in the implementation of the cascade management plans under both the Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP) and the Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP). The aim of these interviews was to gather insights into the practical aspects of implementation, the challenges encountered, particularly concerning the limitations of the existing governance structures, proposals for improvement, and recommendations regarding the role, composition, and challenges of the cascade management committees.
Writing workshop at the regional level.
A Provincial Write shop was conducted with regional stakeholders to understand their perspectives on the sustainability of cascade management committees (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Write-shop introduction By Dr.Upali Amarasinghe, Senior Researcher, IWMI
At the beginning of the write-shop, IWMI officers provided an overview of its purpose and methodology. Following this introduction, stakeholders were given the opportunity to engage in brainstorming sessions aimed at developing a policy action plan to ensure the sustainable operations of Cascade Management Committees (CMCs) and enhance the benefits for tank communities and cascade ecosystems. The stakeholders then brainstormed (Figure 2 and 3) separately on the following Key Discussion Points, which formed the foundation for framing the policy action plans.
Key Discussion Points
1. What are the critical functions of a CMC to ensure sustainable operation?
Identify governance and other constraints that CMCs may face in conducting these operations.
3. What should the institutional composition of a CMC be to effectively perform these important functions and overcome constraints?
4. Propose actions to minimize the constraints for sustainable operations of the CMC.
5. How should each institution, including farmer organizations, fisheries, livestock, and women’s organizations in individual tanks, contribute to the CMC operations to ensure sustainability?

Findings
Write-Shop at Kovilkulam (Northern Province)
Both officials and farmers emphasized the importance of the interconnection between different parts of the cascade system, stating that this interconnectedness is crucial for enhancing overall resource efficiency. It facilitates the optimal utilization of water resources, ensuring that each section of the cascade system can effectively support agricultural needs while maintaining ecosystem health. Participants identified several primary factors degrading the functionality of cascade systems, including encroachment, illegal tree cutting, and unauthorized chena cultivation. They noted that the lack of clearly defined boundaries for many tank-cascade systems and their associated land uses (such as forest areas, agricultural fields, settlement areas, and grazing lands) complicates effective management, leading to encroachment where individuals unlawfully develop land within designated tank areas. Consequently, establishing these land-use boundaries is a critical task for the proper functioning of the cascade system. Moreover, inadequate maintenance of tanks and canals significantly reduces agricultural productivity. Currently, insufficient financial resources are allocated for tank restoration efforts, highlighting the need for a mechanism to provide financial support at the cascade level. Certain areas of the cascade system also fall under the jurisdiction of the Forest Department, which hinders maintenance activities for tanks and canals. This situation severely limits the ability to create or renovate drainage systems in these areas, complicating effective management and rehabilitation efforts. Therefore, a platform for negotiation is required to discuss local issues with diverse government officials.
Participants emphasized a disconnect between existing government interventions and the limited understanding of the practical, day-to-day challenges faced by farmers and rural communities. Furthermore, they stressed the importance of having a timely problem-solving mechanism for rural communities. They also emphasized the need for inclusive governance structures and leadership at the cascade level to balance grassroots needs with the complexities of upper-level management. It was suggested that committees include representatives from village-

level community organizations and officials familiar with local tanks and drainage systems, such as Agricultural Officers (AOs) from the Department of Agrarian Development and officers from the Irrigation Department, to provide technical support and guidance. A multiscale approach to decision-making at the cascade system level, district secretariat level, and district level was proposed. However, the effectiveness of these committees largely depends on their ability to engage with local communities and address the specific challenges faced by farmers and rural populations. A clear pathway for addressing grassroots-level issues must be established and effectively communicated through village, divisional, district, and national levels.
Participants pointed out the lack of climate information available at the local level and highlighted the importance of weather monitoring systems and proper maintenance of water levels in each tank. Therefore, developing a cascade-level water management mechanism is essential, and establishing a water management framework at the cascade level is one of the functions of the Cascade Management Committee (CMC). They emphasized the need for training farmers in selecting appropriate crops based on soil conditions, climate, and market demand, which is critical for maximizing productivity and profitability. Participants requested awareness training on smart agricultural practices, new technologies, and tank maintenance every six months. Additionally, it is essential to introduce new fish farming practices, enforce restrictions on illegal activities within the tanks, create pastureland, introduce dairy cows, and prioritize the implementation of insurance programs for fisheries and livestock. They highlighted the importance of these initiatives in enhancing agricultural productivity and improving food security within the community. Their perspectives reinforced that establishing the CMC as a local governance framework is essential for supporting farmers and the rural community.
Write-Shop at Nawagaththegama (Northwestern Province)
Participants have highlighted that one of the primary functions of the Cascade Management Committees (CMCs) is to oversee the rehabilitation of tanks within the cascade system. Effective restoration relies on a comprehensive understanding of its fundamental elements, particularly the conservation of upper water catchment areas, which are crucial for maintaining the overall health of the cascade system. CMCs also participate in identifying development approaches and actions that balance environmental preservation with the socioeconomic factors contributing to the system's degradation. Furthermore, CMCs engage with legal challenges related to governance by preparing the necessary frameworks to support sustainable practices. They play an integral role in forming governance structures that promote organized management within the cascade systems. Further, the CMC has the financial capacity to rehabilitate the irrigation system and influence governance mechanisms.
Additionally, CMCs are tasked with educating farmers about the entire micro-irrigation system, fostering awareness of efficient water usage and protective measures. This educational role is essential for the long-term sustainability of the cascade systems, empowering farmers to manage their resources effectively. Another vital responsibility of CMCs is the dissemination of accurate climate data to farmers during the Yala and Maha cultivation seasons. By providing timely guidance on irrigation preparations and expected precipitation, CMCs enable farmers to make informed decisions, ultimately optimizing crop yields. The introduction of suitable seed varieties tailored for varying cultivation cycles further enhances agricultural productivity.
Identifying the governance and other constraints that CMCs may face in conducting their operations reveals several significant barriers to effective cascade management. One major issue is the limited understanding of the system’s complexities by both farmers and government officers. This gap in understanding of interdependencies can result in ineffective management decisions and a failure to align with Cascade Management Committee (CMC) initiatives. Additionally, there is a lack of legal authority and clearly defined boundaries for the cascade system, which limits the committees’ ability to enforce necessary actions and regulate encroachment or misuse of resources. Unclear boundaries within the cascade system further complicate management efforts, making it difficult to coordinate resources and apply regulations. Furthermore, collaboration efforts are hampered by a lack of interest from both farmer organizations and some government officers, compounded by the absence of a supportive inter-institutional environment. A shortage of financial resources poses a major hurdle for CMCs, restricting their ability to carry out essential maintenance and development tasks.
The participants highlighted that the effectiveness of the cascade system relies on transparent collaboration between government officers and farmers. Key stakeholders involved in this collaboration include the Divisional Secretary, who oversees coordination between local and national agencies in policy implementation and resource allocation; the Agrarian Development Officer, who works closely with local farmers to promote sustainable

agricultural practices, introduce new technologies, and ensure the efficient use of water resources; and the Office Bearers of Farmer Organizations, who represent grassroots levels and work directly with farmers to address their needs, advocate for resources, and align local practices with regulatory standards. Additionally, the Department of Irrigation oversees all aspects of water resource management within the cascade system, while Environmental Protection Institutions focus on preserving natural resources and preventing ecological degradation in cascade areas. The Fisheries Sector Institutions regulate overfishing, protect aquatic life, and address issues related to water pollution and habitat degradation. Livestock Development Institutions encourage sustainable livestock practices, promoting controlled grazing and preventing overgrazing that can negatively impact soil and water resources. Finally, the Provincial Government and Local Authorities act as liaisons between the national government and local entities, managing resources, addressing infrastructure needs, and supporting community-level initiatives.
The participants proposed actions to minimize the constraints for sustainable operations of the CMC. A comprehensive legal framework will be established to facilitate collaboration across essential departments, including Agriculture, Irrigation, and Environment. This framework will specify shared responsibilities and provide mechanisms for dispute resolution, ensuring unified action among departments. To foster trust and compliance with the cascade system’s regulations, all CMC operations will be transparent. Project plans, budgets, and reports will be publicly displayed to maintain a high level of accountability within the community.
A dedicated committee will be established to regularly assess the effectiveness of cascade management activities. This committee will conduct monthly reviews, evaluate ongoing projects, and perform audits to ensure that objectives are met, and resources are efficiently utilized. To ensure consistent alignment and clear communication, monthly meetings will be organized with key stakeholders, such as the Divisional Secretary, Agrarian Development Officer, and representatives from farmer organizations. These meetings will serve as checkpoints to assess progress, address any emerging issues, and refine strategies as needed.
A government officer will be designated to oversee all cascade-related activities. This individual will serve as a liaison across departments, address community concerns, and ensure the implementation of planned actions, with adequate authority and resources to support effective supervision. The participants emphasized the need for informational sessions and workshops to educate CMC members on the importance of their roles in sustaining the system. These sessions will clarify formal responsibilities and underscore the importance of active participation for long-term sustainability. Regular workshops will be conducted to develop technical knowledge in critical areas like water management, tank rehabilitation, and environmental conservation. These sessions will emphasize the role of tank cascade systems and train farmers in water-efficient techniques and methods to reduce environmental impacts.
Each community within the CMC plays a vital role in ensuring the sustainability of CMC operations. Farmer Organizations (FOs) coordinate seasonal activities, manage water allocation, and adjust crop plans based on weather patterns, promoting fair distribution of water resources.

Introduction
The Village Tank Cascade System (VTCS) is an ancient infrastructure developed over 2,000 years ago, designed to adapt to water scarcity in Sri Lanka's dry zone. The VTCS is primarily used for irrigation in this region. The term ""tank cascade"" refers to a network of interconnected tanks arranged sequentially from higher to lower elevations, allowing for the efficient distribution and storage of water (Panabokke et al., 2002). The Village Tank Cascade Systems (VTCS) in Sri Lanka exemplify a significant framework for water resource management, integrating hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics. This framework is crucial for the sustainable development of rural communities in the dry zone, particularly in the face of increasing climate variability and socio-economic challenges (Melles and Perera, 2020; Mendonce et al., 2024; Ratnayake et al., 2021; Gunasena and Nianthi, 2024; Nanthakumaran et al.,2022).
Over the past few decades, water governance frameworks in Sri Lanka have traditionally focused on rehabilitating individual tanks rather than restoring the entire cascade system (Amarasinghe, 2022; Dharmasena and Bandara, 2009; Hewawasam and Matsui, 2022). This fragmented approach often neglects the interconnected hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics crucial to the system's long-term sustainability. Since independence, the Village Tank Cascade Systems (VTCS) management has been divided among multiple government agencies, leading to overlapping responsibilities and unclear roles (Ariyawanshe et al., 2023; Wijekoon et al., 2016). The top-down approach has often overlooked the needs of local communities, resulting in poor coordination, inefficient water resource management, and the worsening of rural poverty.
As a result of this top-down management mechanism, many village tanks are now experiencing physical degradation, such as silted beds, damaged sluices, and unlined canals, which are often aggravated by encroachment from expanding human settlements and agricultural fields (Aheeyar, 2013; Kekulandala et al., 2024). This physical deterioration of the cascade system negatively impacts agricultural productivity and community livelihoods (Ratnayake et al., 2024; Sirimanna et al., 2022). The cultivable area of small tanks has gradually decreased due to sedimentation and significant water losses, leading to lower cropping intensity in the dry zones. Farmers frequently experience crop failures, particularly during the Yala season. Rural populations in these regions suffer from worsening living conditions due to unreliable water supplies and frequent crop losses. Previous management efforts, which focused primarily on maximizing agricultural output, have largely overlooked the broader social, cultural, and ecological factors essential for long-term sustainability (Senaratne & Scarborough, 2011; Timsina & Weerahewa, 2023). The historical use of tank water for domestic purposes has increasingly been replaced by commercial agricultural practices, leading to significant agrochemical contamination, which now renders tank water unsafe for direct consumption.
The centralization of decision-making processes has resulted in neglecting the Village Tank Cascade System's (VTCS) multifunctional role, with an undue emphasis on agricultural productivity at the expense of other critical functions (Ratnayake et al., 2024; Kekulandala, 2021). Past policies and strategies, particularly in water management and the agricultural sector, have failed to adequately incorporate community input, further exacerbated by insufficient focus on restoring surrounding ecosystems. The lack of a cohesive governance framework for the VTCS has impeded effective rehabilitation efforts.
The Department of Agrarian Development (DAD) delegates the day-to-day operations and maintenance of village tank-based irrigation systems to Farmer Organizations (FOs). In Sri Lanka, FOs function at the local level as community-based water governance bodies, playing a vital role in water management and decision-making. However, FOs are not fully equipped to manage all the functions required for the sustainable management of Village Tank Cascade Systems (VTCS), which are complex resource systems. Their limited scope and membership do not adequately address the broader issues at the cascade level (Kekulandala, 2021; Imbulana et al., 2023)
Therefore, a coordinated governance approach that integrates both ecological restoration and community needs is essential for the sustainable functioning of the VTCS. Additionally, water resource rehabilitation, along with other rural development projects, must prioritize the integrity of the entire cascade system to preserve vital hydrological and ecological linkages. By adopting this holistic approach, we can enhance agricultural productivity, optimize water resource management, and ensure the long-term sustainability of rural communities.

Recent research (Ariyawanshe et al., 2023; Imbulana et al., 2023; Dharmasena, 2020; Harischandra, 2010; Kekulandala, 2021) and project initiatives, such as the Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP https://criwmp.lk/ ), the Climate-Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP https://csiap.lk/), and the Smallholder Agribusiness and Resilience Project (SARP https://www.sarp.lk/si/), have highlighted the importance of managing cascade systems and implementing cascade-level governance to enhance the socio-economic resilience of Village Tank Cascade Systems (VTCS) in Sri Lanka. Establishing a formal coordinating body for VTCS, such as a Cascade Management Committee (CMC), would strengthen local stakeholder engagement and improve policy coherence.
Cascade Management Committees have been established to enhance cooperation and ensure effective VTCS governance. These committees aim to coordinate local communities and stakeholders for the long-term functionality and resilience of tank systems. IWMI, under the Governance for Resilience (G4R) workstream of the CGIAR’s ClimBer research initiative, developed a multiscale polycentric governance tool guide for planning and implementing transformative adaptation interventions to climate change. IWMI’s G4R research in Sri Lanka showed that CMCs are indeed a transformative adaptation option, and an effective management mechanism supported by a multiscale polycentric governance framework is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the CMC and its systemic impacts.
The Department of Agrarian Development (DAD) in Sri Lanka is responsible for managing village tank irrigation systems and supporting farming communities. In August 2023, the DAD issued a circular outlining the establishment of cascade-level governance mechanisms, including the roles and composition of Cascade Management Committees (CMCs). Currently, The DAD is developing strategies to ensure the long-term sustainability and effective operation of CMCs, in collaboration with CRIWMP, CSIAP, and SARP.
In support of this initiative, in October 2024, IWMI conducted write-shops to gather regional stakeholders' perspectives, contributing to the design of an effective policy action plan for the sustainable operation and management of CMCs. Two regional stakeholder write-shops were held with tank cascade-based communities and officials in Nawagaththegama (Northwestern Province) and KovilKulam, Vavuniya (Northern Province). These write- shops gathered stakeholders' insights to develop a policy action plan to ensure the sustainable operation of CMCs, foster rural development, and enhance climate resilience.
Methodology of the study
Review of Existing Literature on Tank Cascade Systems and Governance
A review of existing literature on cascade systems and governance provides a valuable foundation for understanding how these systems function and have been managed over time. This preliminary review offered insights into the historical, environmental, and social dimensions of cascade management.
Review of existing cascade management committee plans
Cascade Management Plans have been developed through recent initiatives, including the Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP) and the Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP). These plans are available for specific cascade systems, such as Babawa, Palugaswewa, and Kapugama. As an outcome of these projects, governance structures for Cascade Management were proposed to support sustainable management practices. At the beginning of this study, a review of these plans and their proposed governance structures was conducted to identify potential areas for strengthening the cascade management committees.
Analysis of Plans and Their Proposed Governance Structures
The analysis aimed to identify similarities, differences, and potential gaps in the approach, resources, governance structures, and outcomes between the two projects. This involved evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, resource allocation, the structure and functioning of the governance frameworks, and how these factors contributed to achieving the intended goals of each project.

Stakeholder Interviews
Interviews were conducted with key officials and stakeholders involved in the implementation of the cascade management plans under both the Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP) and the Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP). The aim of these interviews was to gather insights into the practical aspects of implementation, the challenges encountered, particularly concerning the limitations of the existing governance structures, proposals for improvement, and recommendations regarding the role, composition, and challenges of the cascade management committees.
Writing workshop at the regional level.
A Provincial Write shop was conducted with regional stakeholders to understand their perspectives on the sustainability of cascade management committees (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Write-shop introduction By Dr.Upali Amarasinghe, Senior Researcher, IWMI
At the beginning of the write-shop, IWMI officers provided an overview of its purpose and methodology. Following this introduction, stakeholders were given the opportunity to engage in brainstorming sessions aimed at developing a policy action plan to ensure the sustainable operations of Cascade Management Committees (CMCs) and enhance the benefits for tank communities and cascade ecosystems. The stakeholders then brainstormed (Figure 2 and 3) separately on the following Key Discussion Points, which formed the foundation for framing the policy action plans.
Key Discussion Points
1. What are the critical functions of a CMC to ensure sustainable operation?
Identify governance and other constraints that CMCs may face in conducting these operations.
3. What should the institutional composition of a CMC be to effectively perform these important functions and overcome constraints?
4. Propose actions to minimize the constraints for sustainable operations of the CMC.
5. How should each institution, including farmer organizations, fisheries, livestock, and women’s organizations in individual tanks, contribute to the CMC operations to ensure sustainability?

Findings
Write-Shop at Kovilkulam (Northern Province)
Both officials and farmers emphasized the importance of the interconnection between different parts of the cascade system, stating that this interconnectedness is crucial for enhancing overall resource efficiency. It facilitates the optimal utilization of water resources, ensuring that each section of the cascade system can effectively support agricultural needs while maintaining ecosystem health. Participants identified several primary factors degrading the functionality of cascade systems, including encroachment, illegal tree cutting, and unauthorized chena cultivation. They noted that the lack of clearly defined boundaries for many tank-cascade systems and their associated land uses (such as forest areas, agricultural fields, settlement areas, and grazing lands) complicates effective management, leading to encroachment where individuals unlawfully develop land within designated tank areas. Consequently, establishing these land-use boundaries is a critical task for the proper functioning of the cascade system. Moreover, inadequate maintenance of tanks and canals significantly reduces agricultural productivity. Currently, insufficient financial resources are allocated for tank restoration efforts, highlighting the need for a mechanism to provide financial support at the cascade level. Certain areas of the cascade system also fall under the jurisdiction of the Forest Department, which hinders maintenance activities for tanks and canals. This situation severely limits the ability to create or renovate drainage systems in these areas, complicating effective management and rehabilitation efforts. Therefore, a platform for negotiation is required to discuss local issues with diverse government officials.
Participants emphasized a disconnect between existing government interventions and the limited understanding of the practical, day-to-day challenges faced by farmers and rural communities. Furthermore, they stressed the importance of having a timely problem-solving mechanism for rural communities. They also emphasized the need for inclusive governance structures and leadership at the cascade level to balance grassroots needs with the complexities of upper-level management. It was suggested that committees include representatives from village-

level community organizations and officials familiar with local tanks and drainage systems, such as Agricultural Officers (AOs) from the Department of Agrarian Development and officers from the Irrigation Department, to provide technical support and guidance. A multiscale approach to decision-making at the cascade system level, district secretariat level, and district level was proposed. However, the effectiveness of these committees largely depends on their ability to engage with local communities and address the specific challenges faced by farmers and rural populations. A clear pathway for addressing grassroots-level issues must be established and effectively communicated through village, divisional, district, and national levels.
Participants pointed out the lack of climate information available at the local level and highlighted the importance of weather monitoring systems and proper maintenance of water levels in each tank. Therefore, developing a cascade-level water management mechanism is essential, and establishing a water management framework at the cascade level is one of the functions of the Cascade Management Committee (CMC). They emphasized the need for training farmers in selecting appropriate crops based on soil conditions, climate, and market demand, which is critical for maximizing productivity and profitability. Participants requested awareness training on smart agricultural practices, new technologies, and tank maintenance every six months. Additionally, it is essential to introduce new fish farming practices, enforce restrictions on illegal activities within the tanks, create pastureland, introduce dairy cows, and prioritize the implementation of insurance programs for fisheries and livestock. They highlighted the importance of these initiatives in enhancing agricultural productivity and improving food security within the community. Their perspectives reinforced that establishing the CMC as a local governance framework is essential for supporting farmers and the rural community.
Write-Shop at Nawagaththegama (Northwestern Province)
Participants have highlighted that one of the primary functions of the Cascade Management Committees (CMCs) is to oversee the rehabilitation of tanks within the cascade system. Effective restoration relies on a comprehensive understanding of its fundamental elements, particularly the conservation of upper water catchment areas, which are crucial for maintaining the overall health of the cascade system. CMCs also participate in identifying development approaches and actions that balance environmental preservation with the socioeconomic factors contributing to the system's degradation. Furthermore, CMCs engage with legal challenges related to governance by preparing the necessary frameworks to support sustainable practices. They play an integral role in forming governance structures that promote organized management within the cascade systems. Further, the CMC has the financial capacity to rehabilitate the irrigation system and influence governance mechanisms.
Additionally, CMCs are tasked with educating farmers about the entire micro-irrigation system, fostering awareness of efficient water usage and protective measures. This educational role is essential for the long-term sustainability of the cascade systems, empowering farmers to manage their resources effectively. Another vital responsibility of CMCs is the dissemination of accurate climate data to farmers during the Yala and Maha cultivation seasons. By providing timely guidance on irrigation preparations and expected precipitation, CMCs enable farmers to make informed decisions, ultimately optimizing crop yields. The introduction of suitable seed varieties tailored for varying cultivation cycles further enhances agricultural productivity.
Identifying the governance and other constraints that CMCs may face in conducting their operations reveals several significant barriers to effective cascade management. One major issue is the limited understanding of the system’s complexities by both farmers and government officers. This gap in understanding of interdependencies can result in ineffective management decisions and a failure to align with Cascade Management Committee (CMC) initiatives. Additionally, there is a lack of legal authority and clearly defined boundaries for the cascade system, which limits the committees’ ability to enforce necessary actions and regulate encroachment or misuse of resources. Unclear boundaries within the cascade system further complicate management efforts, making it difficult to coordinate resources and apply regulations. Furthermore, collaboration efforts are hampered by a lack of interest from both farmer organizations and some government officers, compounded by the absence of a supportive inter-institutional environment. A shortage of financial resources poses a major hurdle for CMCs, restricting their ability to carry out essential maintenance and development tasks.
The participants highlighted that the effectiveness of the cascade system relies on transparent collaboration between government officers and farmers. Key stakeholders involved in this collaboration include the Divisional Secretary, who oversees coordination between local and national agencies in policy implementation and resource allocation; the Agrarian Development Officer, who works closely with local farmers to promote sustainable

agricultural practices, introduce new technologies, and ensure the efficient use of water resources; and the Office Bearers of Farmer Organizations, who represent grassroots levels and work directly with farmers to address their needs, advocate for resources, and align local practices with regulatory standards. Additionally, the Department of Irrigation oversees all aspects of water resource management within the cascade system, while Environmental Protection Institutions focus on preserving natural resources and preventing ecological degradation in cascade areas. The Fisheries Sector Institutions regulate overfishing, protect aquatic life, and address issues related to water pollution and habitat degradation. Livestock Development Institutions encourage sustainable livestock practices, promoting controlled grazing and preventing overgrazing that can negatively impact soil and water resources. Finally, the Provincial Government and Local Authorities act as liaisons between the national government and local entities, managing resources, addressing infrastructure needs, and supporting community-level initiatives.
The participants proposed actions to minimize the constraints for sustainable operations of the CMC. A comprehensive legal framework will be established to facilitate collaboration across essential departments, including Agriculture, Irrigation, and Environment. This framework will specify shared responsibilities and provide mechanisms for dispute resolution, ensuring unified action among departments. To foster trust and compliance with the cascade system’s regulations, all CMC operations will be transparent. Project plans, budgets, and reports will be publicly displayed to maintain a high level of accountability within the community.
A dedicated committee will be established to regularly assess the effectiveness of cascade management activities. This committee will conduct monthly reviews, evaluate ongoing projects, and perform audits to ensure that objectives are met, and resources are efficiently utilized. To ensure consistent alignment and clear communication, monthly meetings will be organized with key stakeholders, such as the Divisional Secretary, Agrarian Development Officer, and representatives from farmer organizations. These meetings will serve as checkpoints to assess progress, address any emerging issues, and refine strategies as needed.
A government officer will be designated to oversee all cascade-related activities. This individual will serve as a liaison across departments, address community concerns, and ensure the implementation of planned actions, with adequate authority and resources to support effective supervision. The participants emphasized the need for informational sessions and workshops to educate CMC members on the importance of their roles in sustaining the system. These sessions will clarify formal responsibilities and underscore the importance of active participation for long-term sustainability. Regular workshops will be conducted to develop technical knowledge in critical areas like water management, tank rehabilitation, and environmental conservation. These sessions will emphasize the role of tank cascade systems and train farmers in water-efficient techniques and methods to reduce environmental impacts.
Each community within the CMC plays a vital role in ensuring the sustainability of CMC operations. Farmer Organizations (FOs) coordinate seasonal activities, manage water allocation, and adjust crop plans based on weather patterns, promoting fair distribution of water resources. Fisheries and Livestock Committees contribute to sustainable practices by managing fish populations, controlling aquatic "
