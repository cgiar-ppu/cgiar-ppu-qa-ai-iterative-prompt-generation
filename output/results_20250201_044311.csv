  ""explanation"": ""This research result is explicitly focused on climate adaptation by supporting smallholder cocoa producers in West Africa. It provides site-specific climate change risk assessments, tailored adaptation practices, and interactive tools to deliver localized climate data—all of which directly enhance resilience to climate impacts. As the primary objective is to equip small-scale producers with the adaptation strategies needed to counter climate variability, it aligns directly with CGIAR's goals on climate adaptation.""
