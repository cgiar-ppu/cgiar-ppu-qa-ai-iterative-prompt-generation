### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity. 

3. **Assign the score:** Based on the scoring criteria provided, assign the most appropriate score (0, 1, or 2). 

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.
