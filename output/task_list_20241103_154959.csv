To aim for 2 million tons in 5 years (2028), with stable capture fisheries 
production (800K) and aquaculture to reach 1.2 million tons,  
aquaculture must grow by 35% annually and produce additional 
900,000 tons.  This is a tall order!
Where will this come from? What investments are needed and how to 
promote this investment?

Where can we see growth in tilapia production?
•GIFT strain – WorldFish’ calculations of a 10 -year program involving 150,000 
smallholders, to produce 720,000 tons of tilapia, with a total farmgate value of USD 1.4 
billion
•Greenhouse gas emissions and environmental sustainability of tilapia farming appears 
to be better than that of catfish. 
•More than 60 percent of farmers surveyed were interested in growing tilapia. 
•Assumption: farmers will enter/produce; input suppliers/service providers will operate;  
consumers will increase fish consumption or substitute fish/meat for tilapia? (future 
research question and data gap)Where can we see growth in catfish production?
•No new strains anticipated in the near future
•Can we stimulate more producers to grow → more efficient cage system and 
RAS (recirculating aquaculture system)?
•How can we stimulate greater production of catfish?
•How can we expand processing
•How can we start to export?91317

Large untapped water 
resources
•835 km of coastline
•Inland water surface = 14 million ha
•Total available inland water suitable for aquaculture development = 1.75 
million ha
•Estimated aquaculture potential (based on 10% of suitable water surface 
and average fish yield potential of 15/tons/year) = 2.66 million tons
•260+ medium and large dams
•48,000 ha of swamp areas (good for fish farming)
Assumptions: farmers will enter/produce; input suppliers/service 
providers will operate; feed and seed quality improved and become 
accessible to farmers? 
Page 8:
Training and promotion of good 
management practices
•Currently poor management practices among farmers
•Limited knowledge on good management practices 
•Studies show that training is effective in improving 
agriculture and aquaculture practices 
•Good agricultural and postharvest practices more 
effective for controlling aflatoxin (Hoffman et al. 
2021)
•Aquaculture practices increased by 20 -30% fish 
production, productivity, and incomes in Ghana 
(Ragasa et al. 2022); income in Egypt (Dickson et 
al. 2016)
•Increase of 0.45 more kg of fish harvested per 
sqm, or 4.5 ton/ha. Additional income of USD 627 
per trainee per year on average (Ragasa et al. 
2022)
•300,000 tons of aquaculture production →Training can 
potentially add 20,000 to 90,000 tons of farmed fish; 
plus it can encourage new farmers to enter because of 
greater productivity →multiplier effect along the value 
chain.
Page 9:
(2) Growth from other farmed 
species 
(30% of aquaculture production)
•Opportunities to expand crustacean / shrimps
exports
oRe-approval of Nigeria and its Aquaculture 
Residue Monitoring plan for crustacean, 
allowing the export of aquaculture crustacean to 
EU and UK
oRecertification of Nigeria for shrimp export 
through the verification of and use of Turtle 
Excluder Device: Nigeria has been recertified to 
export shrimps to the US.
oCompliance with the requirement of the US 
Regulation on Marine Mammal Protection to 
sustain continuous export of Nigeria 
fish/shrimps into the US.
oDiversification of more cultivable fish species 
targeting commercially viable indigenous fish 
species such as Lates niloticus (Nile perch), 
Gymnarchus niloticus (Aba, knifefish), Labeo , etc.
Page 10:
Growth from artisanal 
capture fisheries 
•Wild fish caught by small -scale fishers provide the 
bulk of Nigeria’s fish supply, however there is very 
little information available on species -level catch
•Sub-optimal artisanal fishery production does not 
contribute adequately to bridging the supply -demand 
gap
•Can we substitute imported fish with improved 
capture fisheries? Which species?
•Potential solutions:
•Better co -management and co -planning with 
communities (how much growth we can 
expect?)
•Better information/data on specie catch and 
stock
•Stock enhancement (how much growth we can 
expect)
✓Artisanal fishing communities should be 
empowered in identifying issues related to 
artisanal fisheries decision -making processes.
✓Establish rural fisheries organizations/groups 
and women’s groups, fishers and women 
groups for partnership development and 
management. 
✓Develop an entrepreneurship plan for 
partnership management, including fishing 
plans.
Page 11:
Potential 
strategies 
Sundried pelagic fish 
should be promoted
Consumption of small pelagic 
fish, increases economic and 
geographic access in local, 
often remote markets. 
High -yielding, eco -friendly, 
low carbon -emission way of 
using the high productive 
potential of inland waters to 
produce nutritious food. 
The vast Niger Delta, home to nutrient -
rich species such as oysters, periwinkles, 
clams, and cockles are primarily harvested 
or gleaned by women ( Nlerum & Bagshaw, 
2015). 
Rich in omega3 fatty acids and vitamin B -12 
(Golden et al., 2021). 
However, water pollution from crude oil 
and gas companies is a commonly reported 
threat to the periwinkle harvest ( Moruf , 
2020; Nlerum & Bagshaw, 2015)
More research is urgently needed to 
address the threats to this aspect of the 
small -scale fisheries sector. 
An important priority is to determine the 
number of women in Nigeria engaged in 
the shellfish industry, and to more 
adequately quantify shellfish production 
(Chuku et al., 2020). 
Page 12:
REDUCTION OF 
FISH LOSS AND 
WASTE
•Various estimates, depending on species:
o8% of catfish, tilapia, and Nile perch are lost during the 
production or landing phases of capture fisheries
o>5% of tilapia and Nile perch may go to waste at the 
market
oadditional 4 –10% of the fish may be lost during processing
oUp to 30% of freshwater clupeids harvest may be lost if not 
processed on time.
•Mortality and spoilage occurs during live fish transportation.
•Fish processing is mostly ad hoc; chain actors use rudimentary, 
unstandardized techniques with regard to fish smoking or 
drying.
•Potential solutions:
oInvestment plans targeted at improving fish processing 
and transportation technologies; cold chains
oDesign, test and manufacture effective practical 
transportation equipment with aeration systems to 
increase survival of live fish.
•Potentially 100,000 to 300,000 tons of fish saved if fish loss and 
waste along the value chain are minimized
•Data gap: we need good data on fish loss and waste and on 
what works and does not work
Page 13:
RISK AND DISEASE 
MANAGEMENT 
•Fish diseases can be devastating 
•Disease -related production losses in Nigeria are widely 
reported, but economic impacts are not known.
oMukaila et al. (2023) estimates a mortality rate 
ranging from 1.86% to 19.73%, which was valued 
at USD 192.79 to USD 2056.38 per production 
cycle, respectively, small -scale catfish farms 
•Health management and disease control in Nigerian 
aquaculture, especially among smallholders and small -
to medium -scale farming practices, is minimal. 
•Aquatic animal health management capacity within the 
national veterinary system is minimal. 
•Limited private sector engagement in aquaculture health 
management needs improvement and strengthening. 
•It is important to assess national aquatic animal health 
management capacity and embark on a technology and 
capacity development program.
Page 14:
EXPLICIT ATTENTION 
TO NUTRITION
•Issue: 
✓Fish supply in Nigeria is estimated at around 24 
g/person/day, which is substantially higher than 
other animal source foods such as other meats (21 
g/person/day), eggs (8.2 g/person/day), and milk 
(3.5 g/person/day). But lower than global average.
✓Nigeria's annual per capita fish consumption in the 
southern region (16.9 kg) was higher than in the 
northern region (6.1 kg) in 2020, though the 
southern region's average fish price is 50% higher. 
✓Fish diversity and nutritional benefits through 
consumption of indigenous species are limited. 
✓No science -based, organized inland fisheries 
management programs are in place, resulting in low 
and irregular catches and availability of nutritious 
inland indigenous species to consumers.
Page 15:
FOCUS ON NUTRITION
•Increasing access to nutrient -rich fish and fish products 
presents investment opportunities. 
•Fish supplies should be increased and supply chains aligned 
to make fish affordable and accessible to the rural poor, with 
special emphasis on northern states. 
•Dried crayfish is a staple aquatic food product in southern 
states and wealthier households but is not accessed by 
northern households. Given that it is a nutrient -dense, shelf -
stable and readily transportable product, promotion in 
northern states should be explored.
•Greater awareness of the importance of fish in the nutrition 
of children and pregnant women isneeded.
•Promoting the use of products such as fish powder would 
improve access to fish among young children.
•FDF and its partners should be monitoring and evaluating 
improvement in fish consumption (quantity, diversity, and 
nutrition)
Page 16:
TRADE -OFFS: 
GROWTH 
VERSUS 
NUTRITION•With scarce resources, we need to prioritize and be efficient!
•Use of food -grade fish, especially nutrient -rich freshwater and 
marine pelagic fish, as a fishmeal VERSUS using them 
affordable, nutritious food for rural and urban poor?
•Promote catfish OR tilapia OR other farmed species –how to 
prioritize funding and investments?
•Promoting Aquaculture versus Import ban to stimulate local 
production VERSUS higher fish prices and detrimental for 
nutrition?
•Investing in aquaculture versus small -scale capture fisheries?
•Useful versus Harm subsidies?
•Knowledge and data -which data to fill first? What are the 
most important data needed to inform policy and 
investment?
•Many trade -offs and questions remain, but some are win -win 
strategies for all subsectors: Enabling environment + 
Infrastructure (electricity, roads and transportation, cold 
chain, ease of doing business)

The Nexus Policy builds on the methodology, indicators and principles developed during 2018 by IFPRI with University of Ottawa, supported by the first phase of the Nexus Regional Dialogue Programme implemented by GIZ, and funded by the German Government and the EU.

Under the second phase of the Nexus Regional Dialogue Programme, University of Ottawa and IFPRI with support of GIZ and legal Council developed a draft Nexus Guidance or Policy building on phase I outputs that were jointly developed with key stakeholders of the NBA. The draft document was discussed with key government and other stakeholders through nine three-day long workshops in each of the basin countries. These workshops included a series of capacity building activities showcasing the importance of considering a nexus approach for growing the opportunities to finance water resources investments in the basin as well as the benefits from the approach for increasing the sustainability of alternative investment options. Recommended changes to the policy were incorporated in a second draft of the policy.  

This second draft was discussed at a regional workshop, where additional changes to the final document were suggested. The key comment was the request by some NBA stakeholders to encourage the use of the Nexus approach without making it a requirement without which no investment supported by the NBA could go forward. 

The third draft was then adopted by the Council of Ministers on December 7. The Niger Basin Authority has integrated Nexus Indicators into its operational and investment planning until 2024, covering 350 projects Skip to main content Dear CGSpace users, we have performed some minor upgrades to the user interface.

Research has shown that current irrigation practices in Uzbekistan, not only reduce flow into the Aral Sea but are also energy-inefficient and create additional problems of polluted return flows, waterlogging and salinity. Introduction of drip irrigation, achieves a 30% saving in irrigation water and therefore pumping energy whilst improving crop yields. The analysis showed that on-farm choices can lead to benefits throughout the Water Energy Food Ecosystems nexus. Research in Karshi Steppe, Uzbekistan indicated that, optimized irrigation could save half a trillion liters of water, spare 259 gigawatt-hours of electricity, and cut power-plant emissions equivalent to 122,000 tons of CO2. These results were shared with Uzbekistan’s presidential administration and Ministries of Water Resources and Economy. The recommendations – that government shift subsidies towards water saving technologies, while seeking to build institutions and create incentives for water and energy savings – have been incorporated into the Water Sector Development Concept of Uzbekistan.

Too often, climate discussions focus on the negative aspects of intensive livestock production. The livestock sector is often cited as the most intensive emitter of greenhouse gases within agricultural production systems, contributing to about 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from methane and nitrous oxide.
However, science shows that sustainable livestock can bring adaptation, mitigation and economic growth benefits to both people and the planet. In addition, sustainable livestock production, especially in developing countries, can contribute to building climate resilience while boosting low-emission development and supporting food security and livelihoods.
With food, for the first time, taking centre stage at COP27, the CGIAR Research Initiative on Livestock Climate and Systems Resilience, ILRI and the GLAD Project, along with partners, sought to ensure sustainable livestock is recognised as essential to climate change mitigation.  As part of this process, we designed an integrated engagement, communications and media outreach plan.

Gathering at Lukenya University in Kenya from the 27th to the 29th of September 2022, Robha and 27 other young pastoralists from Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania came together to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing youth in pastoralism. One of the primary objectives of the conference was to develop a joint statement on the future of pastoralism in the face of climate change, with a specific focus on the challenges pastoralist youth are facing, a call to action for their integration in efforts to support pastoralism and the restoration of the rangelands upon which they depend. That statement was delivered at an official side event–Pastoralism and Rangelands Restoration: Promising solutions to benefit our planet and people–at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change COP27 in Egypt’s Sharm El-Sheikh.

REPORT  
 
The Cow in the Room  
Livestock and Climate Engagement at 
the 2022 United Nations Climate 
Change Conference (COP27)  
 
Report on t he first -ever alliance of livestock partners and 
stakeholder s at a United Nations climate change conference  
 
Background  
 
The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP27) was held 
November 6 -18, 2022, in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, and ILRI was there actively telling the 
livestock sustainability story. Too often, climate discussions focus on the negative as pects of 
intensive livestock production. The livestock sector is often cited as the most intensive 
Page 3:

Page 3 of 11  
emitter of greenhouse gases within agricultural production systems, contributing to about 
18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas  emissions, mainly from methane and nitrous oxide.    
 
However, science shows that sustainable livestock can bring adaptation, mitigation and 
economic growth benefits to both p eople and the planet. In addition, sustainable livestock 
production, especially in developing countries, can contribute to building climate resilience 
while boosting low -emission development and supporting food security and livelihoods.    
 
With food, for the first time, taking centre stage at COP27, the CGIAR Research Initiative on 
Livestock Climate and Systems Resilience, ILRI and the GLAD Project, along with partners, 
sought to ensure sustainable livestock is recognised as essential to cli mate change 
mitigation.   As part of this process, we designed an integrated engagement, 
communications and media outreach plan. This included the innovative campaign dubbed 
‘cow in the room’  #LetsTalkLivestock to drive our participation and narrative to CO P27 and 
beyond. The plan had the following objectives:   
 
• Change the narrative around livestock production systems and explore how they can 
offer climate resilience and low -emission development opportunities.   
• Showcase examples of projects where livestock p layed a pivotal role in addressing 
climate -related shocks affecting rural populations.   
• Highlight livestock’s crucial role in climate resilience and low -emission development 
opportunities in Africa and Latin America by providing concrete examples that have  
benefitted the environment and rural populations.   
 
What we did: Lessons and insights   
 
This was the first time a “livestock alliance” (beyond ILRI and CGIAR) sought to have a large, 
targeted presence at a COP.   Our arrangements included the following:   
 
• The presence of seven  ILRI staff – technical specialists and comm –engagement 
specialists –and an alliance of more than ten organisations.    
• Organised and facilitated an official side event with a coalition of like -minded 
stakeholders/organisati ons dubbed ‘the cow in the room: can sustainable livestock 
production deliver climate adaptation, mitigation and food security ?’  
• Sponsored six  partners to attend in person, including a youth female pastoralist, a 
female PhD student from the University of Sussex, Kenyan and Colombia Ministry 
officials, Ag. Executive Director of IGAD, and the Associate Vice President,  Institute of 
Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida.    
• Speaking opportunities and attendance in over 17 side events and dinners.    
• Extensive social media communications campaign along with traditional media 
outreach.

• Virtual resource cent re on the https://whylivestockmatter.org/   
  
ILRI and partners’ engagements focused on three areas: participation in the Koronivia 
negotiations , side events, communication and media outreach.    
 
• Koronivia negotiations:  ILRI/CGIAR, with many other organisations, ha ve been 
supporting the Africa Group of Negotiators Expert Support (AGN ES) as they 
organised training and coordination pre -meetings ahead of COP27 to build a pool of 
well-trained negotiators and identify evidence that supports Africa’s position in the 
negotiations.  
 
ILRI has been instrumental in this process to help negotiators develop a common 
African position informed by science. This included preparation of a technical report 
on livestock systems in Africa to support AGNES’s UNFCCC submission on that 
previous Koron ivia topic. At COP27, ILRI was an observer at the Koronivia 
negotiations as the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) made a case for the doubling 
of adaptation finance, thus creating greater prominence for loss and damage 
discussions, increasing mitigation m easures and institutionalising agriculture in the 
climate change negotiation process. They also were pushing for the establishment of 
a committee on agriculture within the Koronivia negotiations which ultimately 
became the Sharm el -Sheikh joint work on imp lementation of climate action on 
agriculture and food security.   
  
Our support to AGNES (and therefore to the AGN) throughout the year is key to 
being considered a reliable and legitimate knowledge partner. Our ability to 
influence the decisions being nego tiated at COP comes from our history of 
engagement with AGNES through CCAFS, now AICCRA and other programs. While we 
can sit in the negotiation rooms and observe as the discussions take place, there is 
very little scope to have any influence at the COP its elf. We must engage 
continuously throughout the year and share our evidence as well as understand 
what research is needed by the negotiators and be willing to help contribute to that.

• Communication and media outreach:  With ten partner organisations, we set 
ourselves to d rive a social media campaign framed around having a difficult 
conversation about livestock contribution to climate change and the need to 
recognise that climate mitigation solutions should be different for different 
regions.   The social campaign with the h ashtag #LetsTalkLivestock set out to initiate 
this discussion by targeting people outside the COP. The campaign had a content 
calendar  that allowed partners to join each day of the campaign, designed 
standalone tweets and threads, templates of graphic assets  that allowed partners to 
craft their messages aligned to the COP27 thematic days and side events, and a short 
intro video for the campaign.    
 
The Why Livestock Matter website became a resource hub  and received 4300 views from 
November 1 -18. The traffic to the website was highest at the beginning (800 views on 
November 6) of the campaign and then dropped off dramatically.    
 
The campaign had over 800 mentions and generated more than 500 new followers on the 
International Livestock International’s Twitter  handle . We also organised a Twitter chat that 
helped raise our profile and messages with about 20,000 impressions over the COP period. 
We also uploaded messages, evidence and stories on the whylivestockmatter microsite , 
which had about 4000 visits.

During the period of COP27, Marchmont provided a press office function to offer journalists 
livestock and climate experts as spokespeople for interviews. The team drafted more than 
30 tailored pitches to target journa lists ahead of COP27 with spokespeople and case studies; 
drafted more than 40 tailored pitches to journalists with reaction to the Methane Alert 
Response System  (MARS) announcement; and drafted comments to the final text and 
distribution to the media list. The engagement resulted in interest and interview requests 
from TIME magazine,  Bloomberg and the Daily Telegraph. In addition, Marchmont also 
placed two op -eds during the COP27 period:   
 
•  Foreign Policy, Livestock Are More Than Just Emissions.   Jimmy Smith, former 
Director General, ILRI | November 11, 2022    
• Al Jazeera, Livestock is a form of climate justice in the Global South , Simplice Nouala, 
Head of the Agriculture and Food Security Division at the African Union Commission|

Social inclusiveness is an important objective for the Livestock and Climate initiative. As a 
contribution to this, the initiative is supporting a series of youth consultations to develop a 
vision for the future of pastoralism by 2026, the International Ye ar of Rangelands and 
Pastoralists [ https://iyrp.info ]. The inaugural pastoralist youth meeting  was held in Kenya in 
September 2022 , where a statement from youth in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya was 
developed. As an opportunity to bring pastoralist voices to COP27, the initiative supported 
Afar pastoralist Robha Abekeri to present the vision at the conference. Robha joined a

Insights/learnings   
 
• Need for a more nuanced narrative and messaging  that transcends the 
dichotomous pro and anti -livestock discourses. COP27 showed us that there is a 
suite of critical perspectives about various types of livestock production, and we 
need to keep away from the polarising pro vs. anti -livestock discourse by being more 
nuanced a nd clearer in our messaging that targets:     
o The apprehensive policymaker : works in a large international organisation and 
does not understand the livestock issue but is apprehensive about supporting 
livestock systems due to the negativity around the subje ct.   
o Issue -based advocacy groups : include interests in animal welfare and against 
large -scale industrial production systems. Many in these groups are clear that 
they are only targeting the large, inhumane and unsustainable practices and 
recognise the dive rsity of livestock systems. We have a lot in common with many 
of these value -based groups and could form an interesting alliance. Treating 
them as “anti -livestock” is not only inaccurate, but a disservice to building 
collaborative bridges.    
o Alternative pr otein entrepreneur evangelists : they are entrepreneurs selling 
synthetic meats and alternative plant base proteins to the urban markets. They 
are on a mission to sell their vision and idea (very “tech” driven). While they 
don’t necessarily have time to lis ten to nuance and are promoting their business, 
they should not be assumed to be anti -livestock.    
o Urban vegans and foodies : who are extremely interested in sustainable food 
systems and pushing crafted foods. They seem hard to get through and 
challenging t o engage with.   
o There are also several allies in the development sector and the Global North  
who favour sustainable livestock systems and understand the benefits but are 
not going to advocate openly.    
• Consider early COP28 engagements to shape the agenda : preparation for the next 
COP should start early with a list of stakeholders, influencers and pen holders and 
find new strategic ways to reach them.  Given that there is so much noise at the COP 
itself, we should consider running a campaign in the run -up to  the COP and then 
focus communications around the events and learning (be a thought leader). For 
example, we had an excellent Twitter engagement, and to improve, we should 
collate livestock and climate frequently asked questions and have ready responses 
and supporting evidence.   ILRI should also go into the COP event itself with a well 
researched list of strategic contacts to make, especially oriented around building 
Page 8:

Page 8 of 11  
political demand and raising donor interest in investing in sustainable livestock 
systems.   
• Resource co mmunications  at COP/large events:   Consider commissioning work to 
journalists and writers or run a social media takeover for a day to provide the 
network with fresh insights and engage in online conversations with new partners.     
• Launch a mani festo  / declaration on sustainable livestock principles:  It is a trend 
amongst the climate community, but it is working. It's a great way to set standards, 
track progress and reach new audiences and to articulate a nuanced position. 
Working with our client s, we have noticed that it is also a good opportunity to 
engage corporations. More and more companies sign up for sustainable agendas 
(e.g. on sustainable ocean use), possibly due to the pressure from their customers or 
communities.    
  
Side events:  Livest ock and climate discussions were spread across different pavilions, 
spaces and events inside and outside COP. We were able to coordinate livestock scientists, 
government representatives, and youth engagement in 17 side events (see Annex).    
 
Contributing to the diverse array of events facilitated building connections with 
organisations and individuals with whom we may not regularly have contact, enriching our 
network. However, this was quite taxing. Moving forward, we should be strategic about  
which panels and partners we present with. Also, one week is a good amount of time for 
any one person to be engaging at the COP, implying division of labour between ILRI staff at 
the COP.   
 
We should also be realistic about what we hope to achieve through these side events. These 
are not the space to influence the decisions being made at COP but are rather opportunities 
to make connections with donors and other organizations and promote our research to 
inform media coverage.   
  
Action points and rec ommendations   
 
• For more significant impact, expand the network of coalitions and partnerships  to 
increase our reach and broaden our audience beyond more than we could by 
ourselves. This year, we worked with ten organisations drawn from the GLAD 
network.   
• Though engagement at the COP can raise the flag for a more nuanced debate on 
livestock and climate etc, it does not get to the key decision -makers i.e., the member 
states, who are mainly behind doors with little engagement in the side events. As 
such, the support we provided (engaging from the outside) needs to be 
complimented by stronger strategic action  to more directly influence and work with 
those ‘on the inside’ – and we anticipate working closely with the new CGIAR

beyond.   
• Start early to put together a roadmap of key events and processes  we can work 
towards in partnership. We should have a planning meeting (in March) to set out an 
agenda and also bring partners on board to d iscuss when and how we want to work 
that also:     
o Identifies our national and global engagements roadmap and builds momentum 
early where more nimble discussions and actions occur.    
o Engage early and mainly at the country level to insert sustainable livesto ck in the 
available and upcoming opportunities around the global stocktake and the new 
fund to provide money for loss and damages associated with the adverse effects 
of climate change.     
o Develop an alliance and co -create a campaign that starts 2 -3 months before the 
COP – we might consider making a ‘communique’/declaration/manifesto to bring 
people together.    
o We may also want to consider engaging in the SB58 meetings in June as a way of 
getting involved in the technical discussions around the Sharm el -Shei kh joint 
work on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security    
• Livestock and climate staff and messages were involved in many events, but lacked a 
clear focal point, take -home message or home at COP27 . It could  be worthwhile to 
explor e having a livestock pavilion that provides a unique convening, learning and 
connecting platform. However, it is worth noting that such a pavilion also risks 
becoming a lightning rod for critics of livestock agenda, something which we would 
want to anticip ate and plan for.   
• Relatedly, the Twitter campaign did attract vocal critics of livestock systems, some 
espousing significant disinformation. The ILRI team  did not entertain these posts or 
the conveyors of the messages , but in the future, we recommend deve loping 
guidelines and responses  in anticipation of these predictable messages to contain 
the amplification of disinformation.   
• Taken together, the narrative emerging from our engagement at COP27 events 
depicts a patchwork of some  progress moving the sustainable livestock narrative 
from the margin to the centre. To build on this momentum, stronger alliance -
building and increased st rategic engagements at key moments throughout the year 
will be important . Also, using the   https://whylivestockmatter.org/  site to provide 
more resources and case studies to s trengthen our position.

The CGIAR Research Initiative on L ivestock and Climate  is 
designed to address the challenges that climate change poses 
to livestock production, providing livestock -dependent 
communities with the support they need  without accelerating 
greenhouse gas emissions or degrading land, water, and 
biodiversity.  
 
It forms part of CGIAR’s new Research Portfolio, delivering 
science and innovation to transform food, land, and water 
systems in a climate crisis.

Summary of key findings   
This policy note presents results from an  
economy -wide model to assess the ex-
pected impacts of implementing the Bot-
tom-Up Economic Plan in Kenya.  
• The economywide m odeling results 
suggest that the design of the Bottom -
Up Economic Plan is consistent with 
its goals of achieving  broad- based 
growth  and benefiting the poor, partic-
ularly the poorest of the poor at the 
bottom of the pyramid.  
• We estimate that 5 million jobs will be 
created, 5.5 million people will move 
out of poverty, and 2.9 million peopl e will be lifted out of hunger by 2027 under the implementation of 
the Plan scenario, as compared to today.  
• The s tructural transformation envisaged in the Plan is key for achieving higher middle- income status. 
Growth  driven by productivity -enhancing priva te investments (especially in domestic manufacturing)  
and exports will lead to the acceleration of structural change.  
• Growth led by the agricultural sector is far more effective at reducing poverty than a similar level of 
growth coming from nonagricultural sectors.  
The Bottom -Up Economic Plan . The new Kenyan government has ambitious plans to create jobs, 
eradicate hunger, and lower the cost of living for its citizens. The “Bottom -Up Economic Plan” (hereafter IFPRI KENYA  PROJECT NOTE          DECEMBER 2022  
Page 2:
2 referred to as “The Plan”) operationalizes these objectives by empower ing micro, small, and medium 
enterprises and farmers as the engine for growth and job creation, by broa dening the tax base and im-
proving budget allocation for priority sectors, and by enhancing food production to improve Kenya’s for-
eign exchange balance and inclusive growth. Enhanced access to credit for the private sector is facilitated 
by the establishment of the “Hustlers’ Fund” (Financial Inclusion Fund). As a response to challenges related to information asymmetry that affects market access and risk management, the Enterprise Re-source Planning system is planned for all participants . The five sectors that form the core pillars of the 
Plan’s Agenda include: 1) Agriculture , with a f inancial commitment  of KSh 250 b illion for FY2023– 2027; 
2) the Micro , Small, and Medium Enterprise Sector , with a budget  of KSh 250 billio n; 3) Housing and 
Settlement , with a budget of KSh 250 billio n; 4) Healthcare, with a b udget of  KSh 250 billion, of which 
the budgeted commitment is KSh 50 billion and the remaining KSh 200 billion will be financed by a pen-sion fund;  and finally, 5) Digital Superhighway and Creative Economy , with a budget of KS h 40 billion.

The Kenyan economy is bound to grow much faster under the Plan.  Under the Plan, total 
annual GDP growth is estimated to rise from the base -run scenario of 4.8 percent  to 7.4 percent at factor 
cost and 7.2  percent  at market prices in 2023– 2027. Investments and exports both grow faster than GDP 
(Figure 1). The annual growth rate of investments more than doubles (from its base -run of  3.9 percent  to 
8.1 percent ), with c apital supply expanding much faster than land and labor  force. The trade position 
improves substantially, driven by s tronger growth in export s than in  import s (11.3 percent  versus 5.5  
percent per year ). As a result, the Kenyan economy reorients toward exports and investment s. Private 
and public consumption demand grows more slowly  than GDP , and such growth leads to falling consumer 
prices (CPI falls from 0.8  percent  to 1.2  percent  per year in 2023– 2027) .

3 Growth is broad- based and driven by private sector –led capital accumulation and produc-
tivity enhancements.  Additional growth of 2–3.5 percentage points occurs across all production sec-
tors, indicating that growth is broad- based. Key priority subsectors highlighted in the plan include maize; 
dairy; cattle; tea value addition; expanding and revamping export cash crops such as coffee, cashew 
nuts, avocado, macadamia nuts, and pyrethrum; and revamping leather, cotton, pharmaceutical, and 
textile and clothing industries (see Appendix). The modeling results suggest that focusing on these pri-ority sectors can deliver the expected positive impacts on jobs, poverty, and food security. Consistent 
with the “bottom -up” nature of the Plan, there are larger growth accelerations in agriculture (in relative 
terms) compared to other sectors, while more rapid growth in absolute terms occurs in many nonagricul-
tural sectors that have higher productivity, such as  the manufacturing sector. Broad -based growth is 
accompanied by continued structural change in the Kenyan economy, with more workers employed off -
farm within the agrifood system and in other nonagricultural sectors. I nvestment grow th leads to rapid 
growth in construction of 8.2 percent per year, as well as high growth rates in more capital -intensive 
sectors, many of which are in manufacturing. In total, almost half of total GDP growth in 2023 –2027 is 
associated with investment -led capital accumulation. It is notable that total factor p roductivity (TFP) 
growth is the most important source for accelerating growth,  contribut ing to two-thirds of additional growth 
(the difference between the base- run and accelerated growth scenarios) in 2023 –2027. Labor force 
growth is a third important source for growth, explaining about 15 percent  of total accelerated GDP growth 
in 2023 –2027. Growth in productivity and increases in employment occur in the broad econom y, while 
investment that has a positive effect from the aggregate demand side increases the capital supply em-
ployed in many sectors.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Box 1: Methodology  
The authors first reviewed the Bottom -Up Economic Plan at the deta iled subsector level for specific 
targets. For example, the Plan aims to increase maize yields to reduce dependence on food im-
ports; support export value chains such as coffee, tea, and avocado; expand the apparel industry; 
support renewable energies; establish universal healthcare; and accelerate road infrastructure, housing, and education. Based on a comprehensive review of these sector -specific targets and 
drawing on experts’ opinions, the authors established the expected subsector -level growth rates. 
Based on these subsector -level estimates, the team then used Kenya’s economywide computable 
general equilibrium RIAPA model to estimate the combined impacts of the Plan on social and eco-
nomic outcomes. The RIAPA model aggregates the Kenyan economy into 90 sectors that cover 
production, consumption, trade, and investment activities. The model considers two scenarios: base- run, which reflects the continuation of recent growth trends observed in 2009– 2019 (before 
the pandemic), and accelerated growth, which refl ects the targets of the Bottom -Up Growth Plan for 
2023 –2027, as described above.  
By accelerating sector -specific productivity growth and private and public investment, and through 
intersectoral linkages and spillover effects, the RIAPA model assesses the potential outcomes of 
the Bottom -Up Economic Plan in 2023 –2027. The model measures the impact on the macroecon-
omy (for example, investment, trade, prices) and on sectoral production and employment. With the 
integration of a survey -based microsimulation mod el that details individual households’ consump-
tion and expenditures, the RIAPA model also estimates the household- level impact of the Plan, in-
cluding household incomes, poverty, and food security. In addition, the RIAPA model allows for iso-
lating the effec ts of different sectoral contributions to growth, and can determine which sectors are 
driving poverty and food security outcomes more than others  
Page 4:
4 Growth acceleration leads to rising incomes and employment, lower poverty, and im-
proved food security.  The m odeling results show that GDP increases by an additional US $320 ( KSh 
35,000 ) per person by 2027 ( from US $2,470 under base- run to US $2,790 under the accelerated growth 
scenario by 2027) . Accelerated growth is accompanied by job creation, with an additional 700,000 jobs 
by 2027 alone, in addition to the 4.3 mil lion new jobs expected under the 2027 base- run scenario (that 
is, a total of 5.0 million new jobs by 2027). Rising incomes and additional jobs lead to greater  reductions 
in poverty: it is estimated that 5.5  million people will be lifted out of poverty by 2027, 2.5 million more than 
in the base -run scenario. Importantly —and consistent with the Plan’s targets —growth also benefits the 
poorest of the poor  by further narrowing the poverty gap  (a measure  of the distance between poor peo-
ple’s income and the national poverty line) . The smaller the poverty gap, the more that growth benefits  
the poorest of the poor. By 2027, the poverty gap  declines by 4.2 percentage point s from its level in 2021 
under the accelerated growth scenario, while it falls by 2.7 percentage point s under the base- run sce-
nario. In line with poverty reduction and narrowing the poverty gap, food security is improved. By 20 27, 
undernourishment is expected to improve for 2.9 million people, 1.5 million more than under the base-
run. D iet deprivation also improves. Diet deprivation is an index to measure the gap between household-
level actual consumption and the healthy reference diet, based on six major food groups . By 2027, the 
index falls by 8.1 percent from its 2021 level under the accelerated growth scenario, 3.7 percentage 
points more than the decline under the base -run.

5 In summary, the Plan’s design is consistent with its goals, but the literature suggests that 
its success will depend on many internal and external factors.  Achieving inclusive economic 
growth as envisaged in the Plan will require continued national efforts to improve governance and public 
sector reforms by creating an enabling environment for investments and businesses; improving collabo-
ration and coherence between national and county -level governments in the design and implementation 
of policies and projects; and enhancing economic management to address existing market failures (KIPPRA 2020). Continued research and evaluation during the Plan’s implementation will also be im-
portant to monitor impact and make any needed changes to ensure that the Plan leads to more inclusive 
growth and benefits the poorest of the poor.

Economic Indicators

Background: The Economy
•Kenya’s macroeconomic environment remained robust as the economy expanded by 7.5% in 
2021.
•In nominal terms, GDP increased from Ksh 8.5 trillion in 2017 to Ksh 12.1 trillion in 2021, implying a steady performance for Kenya.
•The growth was supported by improved performance in key sectors of the economy e.g., Manufacturing (6.9%), Wholesale and Retail Trade (7.9%), Real Estate (6.7%), Transportation and Storage (7.2%), and Financial and insurance activities (12.5%). 
•The per capita income for Kenya has stabilized at slightly over US$ 2,000 for the years 2019 to 2021 thereby making Kenya still be categorized at lower middle -income levels. 
•The per capita income improved from US$ 1,805.4 in 2017 to US$ 2,204.7 in 2021.

Bottom -upeconomic plan: Targets
•Targets to:
–Mobilise and influence allocation ofcapital inaway that generates most benefits to
theeconomy
–Create Employment focusing onagriculture and informal sectors,
•Hence, themodel directs resources tothetwo sectors
–Promote income distribution, economic stability, adequate taxrevenue,
•Model focuses oninvesting thelimited capital available where itwillcreate themost jobs
–atthebottom ofthepyramid.
•Commitment toinvest Sh500b over thenext five years insmallholder agriculture and the
informal sector .
Page 8:
Highlights –Policy Concern
•Economic Transformation
–transform Kenya’s economy through the “ bottom -up economic plan”
–empower MSMEs and farmers, as the engine for growth; as well job creation
•Tax Revenue and Tax Administration
–broaden the tax base and ensure that everyone pays their equitable share of the tax burden
•Servicing public debt and pending bills
–Service debt, borrow cheaply and pay bills going forward.
•Employment creation & Access to credit
–Establish Hustler fund
•Budget allocation and Sector funding
–Key sectors to receive enhanced funding
•Subsidies
–enhance food production to eliminate the food subsidy and establish a fuel stabilization fund
Page 9:
Modeling the impacts of the Bottom -Up plan: 
Assumptions
•KIPPRA and IFPRI team have reviewed the Bottom -Up Economic Plan at subsector -
levels;  (e.g., target increases of maize yields, reducing dependence on food imports, supporting 
export value chains of coffee, tea, avocado etc.; apparel industry, renewable energies, universal 
healthcare, road infrastructure, housing, education, healthcare etc.).
•Based on expert opinions, the team has then estimated the expected sub- sector level 
growth rates for 89 sectors.
•Based on these subs- sector -level estimates, the team has then used an economy- wide 
CGE model to estimate the impacts of the Bottom- Up Economic plan on social 
outcomes.

www.cgiar.org2. Accelerate the industrialization 
and commercialization of the food 
system
Mechanization
Productivity
Value addition
Non -agricultural jobs
Integrate farmers to domestic and export 
markets
Priority actions
1.Broaden the strategic and policy focus from a “food 
security” to a “food systems” approach 
To support the economic transformation envisioned by Kenya’s Bottom -
Up Economic Transformation Agenda 2022
Focus on sub -sectors that reduce poverty,  create employment, improve 
diets
Page 24:
www.cgiar.org3. Expand access to food system activities for smallholders
Better -targeted and administered fertilizer subsidy system; supporting domestic 
fertilizer production; reducing last- mile delivery costs; promoting the use of 
alternative or additional fertilizer sources
Enhanced access to credit. The use of formal insurance markets is a viable policy 
option because it transfers risk outside of households and thus protects their 
collateral. Bundling insurance with credit also minimizes the risk of default by 
smallholder borrowers
4. Build on Kenya’s digital success to transform food systems
Expand digital infrastructure, particularly in remote rural areas
Pursue public -private partnerships for transformative and sustainable digital 
innovation and scalingPriority actions…
Page 25:
www.cgiar.org5. Improve nutrition through production 
and consumption policies
Food systems development will raise real incomes of 
households –producers and consumers
Promote a more diverse food production base that reduces reliance on food imports
Invest in food safety
6. Provide better opportunities for women 
to make food systems more productive
Harness women’s contributions to realize the full 
potential of the Kenyan food system
Policies must address low rates of women’s land ownership, minimal participation in decision -making 
and food governance, challenges in obtaining resources to produce food, and weaker networks 
than men
Priority actions…

www.cgiar.org
Priority actions…
7. Improve animal health and disease 
control
Support the veterinary laboratory system by 
providing technical support for disease 
surveillance, diagnosis, and quality control
Promote equitable access to services (for 
example, vaccines), especially in value chains 
where women play a large role, such as 
indigenous chicken value chains
Establish a “One Health” approach to control zoonotic diseases and cross- county and 
transboundary infectious diseases
The private sector can also aid in the last- mile 
delivery of efficient and timely veterinary 
services 
Private and public sector initiatives should 
coordinate with Kenya Wildlife Services to 
control diseases at the livestock -wildlife 
interface
Page 27:
www.cgiar.org8.Allocate appropriate levels of domestic funding
Only 2 percent of the national budget dedicated to agricultural sector
This expenditure remains below public ","10948"

Conceived in 2014 with a holistic sustainability vision, Hacienda San Jose (HSJ) has proved that it is possible to enhance beef cattle productivity along with a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Thanks to the forages developed by CIAT (e.g., Urochloa humidicola cv. Tully/CIAT 679), which store large amounts of carbon in soils through its deeper root system, in conjunction with improved cattle genetics and pasture management, the OneCGIAR Livestock and Climate (L&C) initiative has shown that the GHG emissions intensity of cattle produced in HSJ is 44% lower than reference cow-calf farms in the region, resulting in a negative carbon footprint.

This science-based evidence provided by the L&C initiative has helped HSJ to access $7.7 Mio USD loan in 2022 by the impact investment fund &Green, which will support expanding improved practices operations in 180,000 ha - an area larger than the city of London.

Part 1:  Executive summary  
 
This report  summarizes findings of the work  carried  out by CIAT  under  the World  Bank  
project,  ‘Livestock  sector  readiness  to access  climate  finance’,  whose  objective  is to 
increase  the readiness  of public  and private  entities  within  the livestock  sector  to access  
climate  finance . 
The Colombian  beef  sector  is growing  rapidly  as a response  to increased  demand  in the 
domestic  as well as foreign  markets.  There  is a growing  body  of evidence  showing  that 
growth  in the beef  sector  is driving  deforestation,  as expansion  of pastures  results  from  
encroachment  on forest  cover . Thus,  negatively  impacting  the environment.  Consumers  
may  be more  attracted  to buying  sustainably -produced  beef,  thereby  avoiding  
deforestation  and using  low-carbon  methods  of production,  at a competitive  price.  
However,  consumers  are often  far removed  from  production  zones  such  as the Orinoquia  
and may  not recognize  negative  or positive  environmental  impacts  of production  systems.  
The World  Bank  project  is thus  testing  the investment  potential  of a value  chain  finance  
approach.  If transparent  and reliable  traceability  systems  can be put in place  to earn  
consumers ’ confidence  that the beef  they  see in the supermarket  has been  produced  in a 
climate -friendly  manner , this can add value  to the product  and ultimately  compensate  
actors  along  the value  chain  for what  may  be perceived  as higher  costs,  and at the same  
time  reduce  the sector’s  climate  impact .

Hacienda  San Jose (HSJ)  is a flagship  enterprise  for cattle  production  in the Orinoquia  
region,  under  the department  of Vichada  in Colombia . Hacienda  San Jose owns  a 
combination  of high -quality  cattle  genetics  and improved  pastures  which  increas es 
efficiency  in cattle  ranching  whilst  reducing  the climate  impact  of its operations.  
The International  Center  for Tropical  Agriculture  (CIAT)  was commissioned  by the World  
Bank  to develop  a life cycle -based  model  of HSJ to calculate  the annual  and cumulative  
climate  impact  of its operations  for the period  2017  to 2023.  
The scope  of the life cycle -based  model  comprises  of HSJ’s high -quality  genetic  resources  
(breeding  stock,  weaned  heifers,  embryos, and semen  units)  and cow-calves  within  the 
boundary  “cradle  to farm -gate”,  including  upstream  activities  such  as infrastructure  and 
production  of feed  supplements.  Relevant  greenhouse  gas GHG  emissions  and removals  
were  quantified  to calculate  the carbon  footprint  at the farm  and product  level  (CFP) . The 
estimation  of climate  impact  was completed  through  calculation  of carbon  (C) offsets  
(occurring  in the forest  outside  the product  system  but still within  the boundaries  of HSJ), 
and through  quantification  of avoided  emissions  from  improved  management  practices,  
i.e. no burning  of savannah  and using electricity  from  photovoltaic  panels.  
Some  of the key findings  indicate  that HSJ reduced  GHG  emission  intensity  by -46% 
compared  to other  cow-calf farms  in Meta,  a department  near  Vichada  (Gonz ález-Quintero  
et al. 2021 ); 8.4 vs. 15.5 kg CO 2eq kg-1 live weight  (LW) . However,  savannah  burning  is a 
phenomenon  rarely  documented  in Meta  (Gonz ález-Quintero  et al. 2021 ). Thus,  a reference  
farm  in Vichada  was simulated  in this study  and resulted  to an even  higher  GHG  emissions  
intensity  of 23.0 kg CO 2eq kg-1 LW, brought  about  by savannah  burning.  
The improved  productive  and reproductive  performance  of the specific  cattle  breed - 
short -cycle  Nelore,  result ed to 8.6 kg CO 2eq kg-1 LW for a cow and two calves.  In 
comparison,  the Brahman  female , the most  common ly used  breed  in the region, would 
produce  in the same  simulated  time  only  one offspring,  resulting  to 10.4  kg CO 2eq kg-1 
LW, an increase  of 21%.  
These  results  suggest ed a very  attractive  potential  substitution  of meat  from  inefficient  
production  systems  currently  operating  in the region  at a rate of 17.5  kg CO 2eq kg-1 LW 
(fattening  farms  in Meta,  Gonz ález-Quintero  et al. 2021 ). 
Soil measurements  at HSJ revealed  two important  aspects  related  to soil organic  carbon  
(SOC)  stocks  for clay soils  in the Colombia's  Orinoquia.  First,  SOC measurements  helped  
refine  the value  of the SOC  stock  reference  for this region.  The SOC  stock  estimated  in the 
native  savanna h was almost  40%  higher  (79.9  t C ha-1 for the 0-30 cm soil depth)  than  the 
reference  default  value  for this climate  zone  and soil type  provided  by the IPCC  (52±6%  t 
C ha-1; IPCC,  2019 ). Improvements  are encouraged  by the IPCC  and contribute  to refining  
estimates  of global  SOC  stocks  and potential  sequestration.  Running  the life cycle -based

During 4 years of negotiations the Genebank Initiative aimed to influence the content of the GBF: (1) to recognize the Plant Treaty's  multilateral system of access and benefit-sharing (MLS) and (2) to support multilateral approaches for benefit-sharing from commercial use of digital sequence information (DSI). Both points facilitate CGIAR's ability to operate genebanks and to carry out breeding and research for the benefit of smallholder farmers. They also have wider impact in supporting open access to DSI and enabling generation and redistribution of monetary and non-monetary benefits to support conservation and sustainable use in low and middle-income countries.   

In 2022, Genebank policy group participated in:  4 'formal' and 8 'informal' CBD meetings with negotiators/stakeholders; submitted a  40 page paper and organized side event for COP 15 delegates re policy implications of DSI use in agricultural research.  

COP 15's GBF and DSI decisions were in line with CGIAR submissions (and of course, other  organizations/delegations that  ‘pushed’ in the same direction), recognizing the Plant Treaty's MLS and creating a 'multilateral mechanism for benefit-sharing from the use of DSI'. 

Work still not finished, however. COP 15 also created an open ended working group to negotiate the operational details of how the multilateral mechanism will work.

 Executive Summary  
Digital  sequence information1 (DSI) is playing an increasingly important role in CGIAR’s conservation and 
use of genetic resources  for food and agriculture , thereby enhancing CGIAR’s ability to creat e benefits for 
resource -poor farmers and consumers in developing countries. It is clear that  DSI will continue to make  
positive contributions to all three objectives of the Convention for Biological Diversity (CBD): the 
conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components,  and the fair and equitable 
sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.   
DSI is being used to assess genetic diversity of ex situ collections to identify in situ  genetic resources that 
are not included in ex situ collections, and quantify the relationships between accessions within and 
among collections.  This information is es sential for developing more effective ex situ and in situ 
conservation strategies. The more knowledge we gain of biodiversity at the genome sequence level, the 
better the first objective of the CBD will be served.  
DSI, coupled with phenotypic and other dat a, such as eco -geographic data , is being used to identify 
materials  that are well adapted to different, and changing, agro -ecological conditions. Integrated into 
animal and crop breeding programs, DSI is increasingly useful for achieving targeted, efficien t uses of 
genetic diversity in sustainable agriculture , more effectively and efficiently than is possible with traditional 
approaches . Use of DSI is essential for meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals , in particular the 
first three goals , i.e., ending  poverty , ending hunger , and ensuring good health  and wellbeing  of human 
beings . 
The use of DSI to develop commercially viable products is predicated on the development and use of 
appropriate DSI-based methods and tools such as molecular markers , gene editing,  algorithms , and 
information technology (IT) tools . Development  of effective tools and tech nologies itself requires access 
and the extensive use of genetic resources, thus generating a two -step process: first, a diverse set of 
genetic resources are used to develop the required tools; then those tools are applied to a second set of 
genetic resour ces to develop commercial products.  
The two -step process inherent in the use of DSI generates a new landscape for sharing the benefits arising 
from the use of genetic resources. The first step (developing the tools) requires the use of a wide range 
 
1 This paper does not address the unresolved issue of the definition of the term Digital Sequence Information (DSI). As used 
in this submission, the term refers to sequences derived from DNA or RNA and includes short and long reads and all 
derived molecular  markers such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Presence Absence variations, insertions and 
deletions (InDels), chromosomal translocations and rearrangements detected through sequencing and Simple Sequence 
Repeats (SSRs), together with their epige netic status and associated annotations setting out current knowledge of the 
functions of different parts of the genome. This corresponds to the narrowest potential definition of DSI as set out by the 
CBD Secretariat (2020a), and comprises a subset of pote ntial broader definitions.

 of gen etic resources, most of which are not used in the second step (applying the tools to create 
commercial products).  Hence, most  genetic resources used and the countries they come from are entirely 
unrelated to the final commercial products. Consequently, it appears that multilateral approaches to 
sharing benefits from the use of DSI are the most practical, reflective of reality, and equitable since they 
could (and should) recognize the contribution of multiple countries and institutions to tools  development, 
and not only the countries of origin of the genetic resources that are eventually integrated in products at 
the end of the research and development chain.  
There are several  ways of developing  multilateral systems. Our experience in managing agricultural 
research projects that are highly reliant on genetic resources and DSI suggests that the broadest, flattest 
possible multilateral system, with fewest exceptions, thresholds, and choices to be made by both users 
and providers would be the most efficient. Such  a system should ‘delink’ access from benefit -sharing, and 
also delink use  of DSI  in particular commercialized  products from benefit -sharing.  The simplest way to 
minimize transaction costs would be for Contracting Parties  to make initial payments based on formula to 
be agreed by the Conference of the Parties to the CBD, with the option to collect from users  under their 
jurisdiction.  Alternative approaches  that require payments directly from  individual commercializers, 
and/or linked to sales of products derived from accessed  DSI, would likely have high er transaction costs 
for generators, providers, and users of DSI, as well as those organizations responsible for the 
administration of those systems . These transaction costs could have negative impacts on agricultural 
research and development that depends upon DSI, to the disadvantage of all countries . Complementary 
forms of monetary benefit -sharing c ould include payments from organizations providing  DSI and 
analytical services on a commercial basis, and sales of reagents.  
New norms and processes adopted under the CBD must be ‘in sync’  with access and benefit -sharing under 
the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (Plant Treaty).   
Ideally, for genetic resources for food and agriculture both  DSI and genetic resources should be available 
under harmonized multilaterally  oriented terms and conditio ns. Given the existence, already, of the Plant 
Treaty’s multilateral system  of access and benefit -sharing, such harmonization should be relatively easy 
to achieve with respect to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. It may be more difficult to  
achieve with respect to other genetic resources for food and agriculture ( e.g.,  livestock, fish, trees  and 
crops and forages other than those  listed in Annex 1 of the Plant Treaty ). 
Newly adopted benefit -sharing norms should also promote non -monetary bene fit-sharing, particularly 
capacity strengthening, including access and use of IT analytical tools for DSI, to close the gap in abilities 
between developed and developing countries to generate, use and benefit from  DSI in the future.

 1. Introduction  
This paper analyses the ways in which CGIAR Centers use  digital sequence information (DSI) in their efforts 
to conserve and sustainably utilize the world ’s most important crop  and livestock  genetic diversity. The 
paper then reflects on which of the benefit -sharing options currently under consideration by the 
Contracting Parties to the CBD2 (and the versions of those options that must be considered by  the 
Governing Body of the Plant Treaty and the UN FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and 
Agricultu re) would provide effective policy support for the continue d use of  DSI in agricultural research 
and development in the future.3 
1.1. CGIAR  
CGIAR has evolved into a new global research and innovation partnership  addressing the evolving global 
context, which demands a systems transformation approach4. Its mission is to deliver science and 
innovation that advance the transformation of food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis . It works 
in five impact areas: nutrition, health and food security; po verty reduction, livelihoods and jobs; gender 
equality, youth and social inclusion; climate adaptation and mitigation; and environmental health and 
biodiversity.  The last of these areas directly support s the CBD . The  primary focus of CGIAR’s research and 
development are  resource -poor farmers and consumers  in developing countries . CGIAR seeks to  scale up  
research  outputs and innovation s through capacity development  and policy, delivered through regional 
and global initiatives  in close  collaboration  with  hund reds of  partners, including national and regional 
research institutes, civil society organizations, academia, development organizations and the private 
sector. Hence the modus operandi  of CGIAR, seeking to bring benefits to developing countries where 
benefits are most needed, meshes closely with the concepts of fair and equitable benefit -sharing  set out 
in the CBD . 
Given the nature of our mission, the networks we operate under and our modus operan di, our experiences 
of using DSI are most relevant to agricultural biological diversity5 and the use of genetic resources for food 
and agriculture. Most of the work  that CGIAR  Center s are doing  in the generation  and use of DSI is related

3 Some of these themes were considered in CGIAR’s 2017 submission to the Secretary of the CBD on  DSI entitled “Potential 
implications of the use of digital sequence information on genetic resources for the three objectives of the CBD: a 
submission from CGIAR ” (available at https://www.cbd.int/abs/DSI -views/CGIAR -DSI-en.pdf ), and later, in a journal article 
(Halewood et al.,  2017 ) based on that submission.

5 From Conference  of the Parties  to the CBD, decision  V/5, Appendix: Agricultural  biological  diversity:  review  of phase  I of 
the programme  of work  and adoption  of a multi -year work programme . CBD: Montreal, 2000.  “Agricultural biodiversity

animals, plants and micro -organisms, at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels, which are necessary to sustain key 
functions of t he agro -ecosystem, its structure and processes.”

 to the conservati on and use of intraspecific genetic diversity,  and sharing of benefits related to those uses . 
Much of our work is focussed on major staple crops, forages and agroforestry species.  Some CGIAR 
Center s also generat e and us e DSI from livestock , fish, neglected crops , known and novel pathogens  and 
soil biota . We shall consider lessons related to the use of DSI from across the spectrum of our work in 
these areas.   
2. DSI and  the conservation of biological diversity  
In 2010, the Conference of the Part ies to the CBD adopted the Aichi Targets6. Aichi Target 13 states: “By 
2020, the genetic diversity of cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and of their wild 
relatives, including other socio -economically as well as culturally valuable spec ies, is maintained, and 
strategies  have  been  developed  and implemented  for minimizing  genetic  erosion  and safeguarding  their 
genetic diversity.”  Unfortunately , the deadline for meeting the Aichi targets has passed and they have not 
been met (CBD Secretariat , 2020 b), and new targets are being set through the Post -2020 Global 
Biodiversity Framework .  
The failure to meet Aichi Target 13 highlights the difficulty  of identify ing and quantify ing the genetic 
diversity that needs to be maintained. The target  will be more achievable when whole ex situ collections 
and representative  samples  of in situ diversity  are sequenced  and, equally important ly, appropriate 
standards for processing and interpreting  sequence data are better established . DSI will help strengthen 
the metrics , once it can be obtained on a large scale, for describing diversity and analysing the extent of 
diversity in situ . This will  aid long -term conservation of maximum diversity so that all elements of the 
diversity present in any one crop plant or livestock species are conserved long -term for humankind.  Thus, 
DSI is a powerful,  and potentially the best , means  to assist  genebank managers, national agricultural 
organizations, companies, indigenous communities and researchers to quantify the diversity present, in 
situ and ex situ, for the major crops and their wild relatives , (semi -)domesticated animal species , and other 
components of agricultural biodiversity . 
As a part of a recent system level review (Hawtin et al. 2020), a 30 -year vision for CGIAR genebanks 
(Sackville Hamilton 2020) was developed highlighting the critical role of appropriately processed DSI for 
the ration al, efficient and effective conservation and use of biological diversity in ex situ  collections. Its 
role in promoting the use of diversity is based largely on developing a catalogue of functionally relevant 
genetic variants, which can be used to optimise the composition of active ex situ  collections. Such a vision 
is both technically feasible and effective.

 2.1. Intraspecific diversity among accessions7 
Example: Asian rice  
A ground -breaking assessment of genomic variation in Asian rice, based on whole -genome sequences 
of purified samples of 3,010 diverse accessions (Weng et al.  2018), highlighted the enormity of the 
diversity present within species and the need for further sequencing. The dataset revealed 27 million 
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP s), 2.4 million small length polymorphisms and 90,000 large 
structural variati ons, with each accession having 1,000 unique SNPs that were not present in any of the 
other accessions. The abundance of variants was found to follow “Zipf’s law”8, indicating that most 
variants are rare. Sample -size trend analysis suggested that if the s ample size had been increased to 
100,000 accessions, the total number of SNPs discovered would have been doubled, and each accession 
would still have 100 unique SNPs.  
One of the key lessons of the  above  analysis was that genome sequences must be processed  to identify 
and catalogue functionally relevant variants. Many sequence variants have no known effect on the 
regulation of genes or the resulting proteins. As such they seem to contribute little to functional diversity 
and hence to rational decisions on c onserving diversity. The analysis revealed around 50,000 genes, each 
represented by on average ten functionally distinct variants. Using this to reduce the raw DSI dataset to 
the gene variants of each accession, Zipf’s law was again found to apply. In this  case, each accession had 
on average 300 unique variants that were not present in any of the other 3,010 accessions, highlighting 
the near impossibility of conserving all diversity. Thus, even with this exceptional dataset , we have barely 
begun to quantify  the diversity of rice. Nevertheless, it should be noted that focusing specifically on 
functionally distinct variants transforms the task of optimising conservation based on DSI into an 
achievable as well as an effective task.  
 
7 In ex situ  collections, an accession is a unit of management of genetic material, managed with the intent to preserve its 
genetic composition as similar as possible to that of the material originally acquired from a provider. Two samples of 
identical genetic materia l received on different occasions would normally be managed as different accessions. One 
accession may comprise a single genome or a genetically heterogeneous population.  
8 Zipf’s law describes an empirically observed negative relationship, linear on a log -log scale, between the abundance of a 
particular variant and the number of different variants observed to be present at that abundance. Originally formulated to 
describe the use of words in a language, by which a few words are used commonly whilst most wo rds are used rarely, it has 
been found to describe abundance -rarity in many situations, including sports, arts and evidently biological diversity.

 Fig. 1. Variant frequency, o r proportion of 3,010 rice genomes that contain a given functionally distinct 
variant  (X axis) vs the abundance or number of variants among that are present at that frequency (Y axis).  
A second key lesson was to highlight the need for more high -quality re ference genome sequences. Most 
of the 3,010 rice genome sequences were assembled by cross -referencing to high -quality reference 
genomes, as is standard for low -cost high -throughput next -generation sequencing (NGS). For 453 
accessions coverage was sufficien tly high for de-novo  sequence assembly, enabling a more in -depth 
analysis. Of the ~23,000 gene families present in at least one of these 453 accessions (defined as a “pan -
genome”), little more than half were present in all of them (the “core genome”). This  again emphasises 
the huge magnitude of within -species diversity, even in domesticated species such as rice which have 
been through the “genetic bottleneck” of domestication.  
The creation of a pan -genome by c ombining multiple genomes of a species has also proven to have high 
potential  value in other species such as tomato for the d iscovery of new genes possibly involved in some 
traits  (Gao et al. 2019) . 
A third key lesson is the critical importance of open and easy access to DSI datasets.  If the data remains 
private, difficult to access or only in raw, unprocessed form, usage will be restricted to only those 
generating data, or with the resources to analyze it for their own use.  To enable easy access to the 3K RG 
variant data by breeders an d researchers, IRRI developed the SNP -Seek database and API ( https://snp -
seek.irri.org ) (Mansueto et al. , 2017). SNP -Seek uses an open -source development model with CHADO 
relational database components combined wi th a non -relational datastore to handle genomic diversity 
data. SNP -seek is accessed on average by 50 users per day to undertake queries of SNP diversity, display 
of regions on the genome, determination of haplotypes, extraction of data, and others. Impact  of GSI  
Page 10:
9 
 usage is evident by the number of studies citing the database and 3K RGP data that are leading to 
improved use of the genetic stocks and creation of pre -breeding products.  
Example: chickpea  
Likewise, sequencing of 3,366 chickpea genomes including 1 95 wild species accessions (Varshney et al. 
2022) could identify genes that show signatures of selection during domestication, migration and 
improvement. Superior haplotypes for improvement -related traits in landraces that can be introgressed 
into elite br eeding lines through haplotype -based breeding were identified. A detailed comparison of 
cultivated (2,258) and wild species, C. reticulatum  (22) accessions with a coverage of greater than 10× 
revealed  structural variations, including insertions (139,483), deletions (47,882), inversions (61,171), intra -
chromosomal translocations (417) and inter -chromosomal translocations ( 2,410)  in cultivated and 287,854 
insertions, 67,351 deletions, 58,070 inversions, 446 intra -chromosomal translocations and 2,066 inter -
chromosomal translocations among C. reticulatum  accessions as compared to the reference genome 
(Varshney et al. 2013).  
The sheer magnitude of diversity is so great that it generates methodological problems using NGS, as the 
absence of a gene from the referen ce genome hampers the quantification of diversity in genomes that do 
have that gene. This in turn leads to ascertainment bias (where increasing differences between the 
reference genome and a test variety increase uncertainty over the genome of the test var iety) and 
underestimation of the diversity of genetic resources that are genetically most different from the 
reference. This has been a particular problem for rice, as Nipponbare (the temperate japonica Japanese 
variety that for two decades has provided the standard reference genome sequence) has proved to be 
highly atypical, especially of the tropical indica varieties grown in most developing countries. The result 
has been growing awareness of the need f or more high -quality genome sequences selected from across 
the full spectrum of diversity to provide a more appropriate choice of reference genomes for each test 
variety. For Asian rice, 15 such high -quality genome sequences have now been established, corr esponding 
to the 15 clades previously identified (Zhou et al. 2020), enabling renewed progress in quantifying rice 
diversity.  
Alternatively, where reference genomes are not available for resequencing, a number of NGS based 
genotyping approaches do not use any individual reference in the identification of specific variation within 
a sample, rather these approaches compare sequence s among the group of samples being interrogated, 
lowering the risk and impact of ascertainment bias.   
 
Example: pot atoes  
The CIP Genebank has been collaborating with Peruvian farmers for decades, developing activities such as 
repatriation, characterization and conservation of potato landraces. A recent study developed by CIP 
estimated the genetic diversity maintained in situ  by farmers from four communities in the Sierra de Lima 
Page 11:
10 
 and ten communities in Pasco in Peru through SNP analysis , and compared it with the molecular database 
of the ex situ  potato collection of the genebank held at CIP. A total of 1,075 traditional potato varieties 
were collected from the fourteen participating communities in collaboration with farmers (one per 
community) through the supp ort of the Association of Guardians of the Native Potato of Peru AGUAPAN 
and the NGO Grupo Yanapai. DNA was extracted from tuber sprout tissues and genotyping was performed 
with Illumina Infinitum SolCAP -V4 potato SNP microarrays and the use of GenomeStudi o software. After 
filtering out the markers with low quality and reproducibility, 2,759 common markers for all the samples 
were used in a multivariate clustering analysis with the support of R software. From the comparison of the 
genetic relationships betw een the CIP collection and the local varieties conserved in in situ , six taxonomic 
groups (Hawkes , 1990 classification) and four ploidy levels (2x, 3x, 4x and 5x) were identified in the 
landraces conserved in situ . The genetic composition between the commu nities of Lima and Pasco was 
significantly different and the communities of Lima presented diversity values higher than those of Pasco, 
with the community of Huancachi in Lima presenting the highest value (He = 0.263) and the community 
from Paucartambo in Pasco the lowest value (He = 0.190). From the comparison in pairs of the genetic 
distances between communities, a lower number of significant distances was observed between the 
majority of the communities of Pasco, which could presume the existence of a gr eater exchange of local 
varieties among the farmers that comprise them. It was possible to identify 88 genetically -unique local 
varieties that were not represented in the CIP collection. In addition, it was identified that the species most 
frequently found  in these communities are  S. stenotonum  subsp. goniocalix and S. tuberosum  subsp. 
andigena . Through collaboration with Peruvian farmers, new genetic diversity was added to the CIP 
Genebank to preserve this diversity in perpetuity. Farmers in turn benefit f rom ex situ conservation by 
accessing the collection through CIP’s repatriation program which gives farmers the opportunity to request 
traditional varieties they have lost , or which might be better adapted to changing climatic conditions in 
the A ndes.  
  
2.2. Intraspecific d iversity within accessions  
With the exception of accessions maintained as clones, accessions conserved ex situ  are almost 
invariably populations of distinct genomes, even for cro p species that are naturally self -pollinating such 
as wheat and  rice. This presents an additional technical challenge to effective conservation ex situ . 
 
Example: sorghum, pearl millet, and pigeonpea  
 
ICRISAT Genebank conducted a study (Allan et al. 2020)  to assess genotypic (DArTSeq ) and phenotypic 
diversity of geographically representative diverse sorghum, pearl millet, and pigeonpea landraces.  
Thirty -six accessions originat ing from diverse parts of the world from each of the three crops were 
analysed, being 25 individual plants per  accession for pearl millet and 15 individual plants per accessions 
for sorghum and pigeonpea. Within -accession distances based on phenotypic data varied from 0.038 to 
0.141, 0.145 to 0.271, and 0.071 to 0.410 for sorghum, pearl millet, and pigeonpea, resp ectively.  A total 
of 45,249 SNPs in pearl millet, 19,052 SNPs in sorghum, and 8,211 SNPs in pigeonpea  were used for the 
analysis of the molecular data after filtering. Pairwise MRD within each accession was averaged, thus the 
overall mean genetic distance within each accession varied from 0.031 to 0.342 for sorghum, 0.181 to 
0.300 for pearl millet, and 0. 040 to 0.393 for pigeonpea. These results show that the within -accession 
Page 12:
11 
 diversity is highly variable among accessions and crops. Enormous variability was observed within and 
among landraces of sorghum, pigeonpea, and pearl millet. Molecular variance withi n accessions was 
observed to be low in sorghum (26.3%), highest in pearl millet (80.2%), while pigeonpea showing an 
intermediate within -accession variance of 57.0%. The level of heterogeneity and diversity in landraces 
are crop -specific and associated with  their mode of fertilization. Based on the level of diversity within 
each accession of different crops, appropriate conservation and regeneration strategy should be 
followed to conserve the genetic integrity and diversity of landraces.  
 
2.3. Quantifying and co nserving livestock diversity  
More than 8 ,800 livestock breeds have been recorded globally by the FAO Commission on Genetic 
Resources for Food and Agriculture, representing a valuable resource and a high biodiversity at the 
genetic level. Precise quantitati ve assessment of that biodiversity is needed to support international 
agreements that recognize the importance of its conservation, such as the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity 
Targets set by the CBD and SDGs 14 and 15 on protecting, restoring and promoting sustain able use. In 
the absence of appropriate DSI production and use, breed attributes and genes that are potentially 
beneficial in the future may be lost. Instead, some breeds may be condemned to extinction and in the 
process , some of the good genes that they m ay have possessed disappear with them.  
NGS techniques have evolved rapidly, allowing  unbiased and comprehensive analysis of genetic diversity 
parameters, providing individuals´ entire genetic information of neutral loci and coding regions, thus,

iIn Vietnam, about 47 million tons of rice straw are produced annually 
along with rice. Of this, only about 30% is collected and used for 
mushroom cultivation, cattle feed, fruit packing, and other purposes. 
The remaining 70% is mainly burned in open fields or left to decompose 
(soil incorporation) in the field. Open-field burning of rice straw not 
only wastes resources and nutrients, but also pollutes the environment, 
reduces biodiversity, and changes the mechanical composition of the 
soil. Straw incorporation in flooded fields increases greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions and can poison the next rice crop by choking the 
roots. These problems can be solved through a circular economy 
solution based on straw. By collecting straw out of the field and using 
it for mushroom cultivation, animal feed, biofertilizer, bioplastics, and 
products for urban agriculture, we can reduce waste, pollution, and 
GHG emissions, while also creating new economic opportunities.
Since 2016, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has 
collaborated with domestic and foreign partners to develop and 
scale up technologies for a circular economy in rice production that 
reduce GHG emissions. These technologies include mechanized straw 
collection, straw use for mushroom cultivation, animal feed, fertilizer, 
and bioplastics, among others.
The document “Technical manual: Rice straw management towards 
circular economy and low emission in the Mekong Delta” introduces 
readers to the characteristics of rice straw, the current status of its 
treatment, and the management process for using rice straw in a 
circular way to reduce GHG emissions in rice production. This manual 
will be a handbook for farmers, extension officers, cooperatives, and 
others who are interested in rice production that is associated with 
circular greenhouse gas emission reduction.
The Department of Crop Production (DCP) highly recognizes and 
appreciates IRRI, the partners, and experts who have collaborated 
with us to publish this document. We are proud to introduce it to the 
readers.

1. Rationale, purpose, scope, and users of the manual 
1.1. Rationale
Vietnam is one of the countries most affected by climate change. In 
2020, agricultural production accounted for 90 million tons of CO₂ 
equivalent (CO₂-eq) in GHG emissions annually, of which 39.1% came 
from wet-rice cultivation, 24.8% from livestock, 33.6% from other 
agricultural cultivation (none-rice), and 2.5% from burning agricultural 
by-products (Le Hoang Anh, 2021).
Vietnam produces about 43 million tons of rice annually, along with 
about 47 million tons of rice straw. In the Mekong Delta, where 
there are three rice cropping seasons per year, farmers often burn 
rice straw in the open field or incorporate it into flooded fields. The 
main reasons for this practice are the short turnaround time between 
seasons, the low value of in-field straw, and the high cost of collection 
and transportation. About 70% of rice straw was burned in the open-
fields and incorporated in the soil, only the remaining 30% is collected 
out of the field for mulching, mushroom cultivation, cow feed, and 
fertilizer (Le Canh Dung et al., 2021). Open-field burning of straw 
causes nutrient loss in straw, reducing biodiversity, and polluting the 
environment while straw incorporation in flooded fields increases 
emissions of CH₄ and other GHG (Nguyen Van Hung et al., 2019).
In order to actively contribute to improving rice straw management 
to enhance the rice value chain towards increasing income, 
sustainability, and alignment with the green growth, the Department 
of Crop Production (DCP) has cooperated with the International 
Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and domestic experts to develop the 
“Technical manual: Rice straw management towards circular economy 
and low emission in the Mekong delta”.
Page 8:
21.2. Purpose
Rice straw management in the direction of a circular economy aims to 
make the most of the nutrients contained in straw, increase the value 
of straw, and thereby reduce open-field burning and incorporation 
of straw in flooded fields. This leads to reducing biodiversity loss, 
reducing environmental pollution, reducing GHG emissions, and 
increasing income for rice farmers and related commercial and 
production services.
The specific purposes are as follows:
• Maximize the collection of straw out of the field and use it in a 
circular way to reduce emissions.
• Scale up new technologies that are technically, economically 
feasible, and contribute to emission reduction, such as 
mechanized straw collection in dry and wet fields, and integrated 
mechanized and biological technologies for producing organic 
fertilizers from straw.
This technical manual is not a mandatory standard, but rather a 
suggestion or guideline to follow. It includes some explanation, data, 
and inferences in order to convince the readers. This document was 
developed based on the current situation and appropriate orientation 
in rice production along the Mekong Delta value chain. However, 
some technologies can be applied to other ecological regions in 
Vietnam and other countries with similar conditions.
1.3. Scope of use and users of the manual
This manual is primarily aimed at the following users: 
• Rice farmers, straw users, and producers of straw-related 
products, such as mushroom cultivation, cow feed, and fertilizer 
from straw.
• Straw collecting services and companies, straw traders, and 
commercial producers of straw products.
• Researchers and developers of green production, low emission, 
and circular economy in agriculture.
•  Agricultural extension officers and managers to develop policies 
to support sustainable straw management.

2. Some basic concepts  
In Vietnam, some names or words may differ from region to region. 
However, for consistency and within the scope of this document, we 
will use some commonly used concepts in practice and science as 
follows:
• Rice straw/ Rơm rạ: This term refers to both the cut portion of 
the rice straw (rơm) and the uncut portion of the rice straw (rạ).
• Straw: This is the harvested portion obtained after threshing or 
separating the grain. For rice stationary threshers, the straw after 
separating the grain is piled up in the field; and for self-propelled 
combine harvesters, the straw is spread in the field along the 
running path of the machine.
• Stubble (rạ): This is the uncut portion of the rice straw that 
remains in the field after cutting the straw.
• GHG emissions:  These emissions are usually measured in 
kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (kgCO₂-eq). They are 
calculated according to the global warming potential (GWP) of 
methane (CH₄) and nitrogen oxide (N₂O) emissions, per unit area 
(ha) or ton of product.
• Carbon footprint:  This is the same as the unit of GHG emissions, 
but it is calculated for the life cycle of production, including 
emissions from chemical manufacturing, energy, machinery, 
equipment, etc. It is calculated per product unit (kgCO₂-eq/kg of 
product). m và hiện trạng sử dụng rơm rạ ở ĐBSCL

3.Characteristics of rice straw and current status of rice straw 
use in the Mekong Delta
3.1. Characteristics of rice straw
3.1.1. Amount of straw
The total biomass of rice straw depends on many different factors, 
such as variety, soil conditions, nutrient management practices, 
and weather. At harvesting, straw is piled up or spread in the field, 
depending on whether the harvesting method is by a stationary 
thresher (Figure 1a) or a self-propelled combine harvester (Figure 1b). 
The amount of straw removed out of the field depends mainly on the 
variety of rice and the cutting height (or the height of the stubble left 
in the field).
The amount of rice straw collected and the harvested biomass index 
of the popular short-duration varieties are shown in Figure 2b. In the 
case of using self-propelled combine harvesters, such as those in 
Southeast Asian countries, the amount of straw that can be collected 
is about 50-60% of rice (at the same humidity).
Figure 1a. Straw is thrown into a 
pile by the threshing machineFigure 1b. Straw spread on the 
field by the combine harvester
Page 11:
5The ratio of rice straw to rice is 1.1-1.5, or the yield of both straw and 
stubble is 1.1-1.5 times higher than that of rice. In the Mekong Delta, 
there is about 7-8 tons of straw/ha/season (humidity about 28-30% 
at the time of harvest). However, the reality is that combine harvesters 
only cut about 50-60% of the rice straw (leaving about 40-50% of the 
stubble in the field).

63.1.2. Main physicochemical properties of rice straw
Straw has a higher heating value (HHV) of 12-15 MJ/kg, depending 
on the quality of the harvested straw and the rice variety. The calorific 
value of rice straw is equivalent to that of rice husk and one-third that 
of kerosene. Other physicochemical properties of straw for use as 
energy, cow feed, or fertilizer are shown in Table 1.

83.2. Current status of rice straw use in the Mekong Delta
The Mekong Delta produces about 24 million tons of rice annually, 
along with about 26-27 million tons of straw. According to Le, et al. 
(2021), 70% of rice straw was burned in the field and the remaining 
30% was collected and used. Of the 7.8-8.1 million tons (30% of the 
total amount of straw) collected, the straw was used for mushroom 
cultivation (30%), mulching and fruit packing (35%), livestock feed 
(25%), and other uses (10%) (Figure 3).

 4. Overview of rice straw management options 
The best method and technology for rice straw management depends 
on many factors, such as technical, economic, environmental, and 
social feasibility and benefits. Some key indicators to evaluate include 
cost-benefit, GHG emissions, environmental toxicity, biodiversity, 
nutritional balance, etc. There are in-field and off-field straw 
management options. For off-field options, straw can be collected for 
various purposes in agriculture, energy, and industrial materials. 
Figure 4. In-field and off- field rice straw management options 
In-field and off-field options for rice straw management are shown 
in Figure 4. For in-field options, straw spread by combine harvesters 
in the field can be burned, incorporated into the soil, or used as 
mulch. For off-field options, straw can be collected, handled, and 
used for mushroom cultivation or livestock feed, soil improvement 
or fertilizer, raw material for biofuels, bioplastics, or raw materials for 
other industrial applications (silica and biofibers). The main options 
for rice straw management are presented in Table 2.

/requests
1Open-field 
burning• Clean the field quickly and 
inexpensively
• Loses 100% of N, 25% of P2O5, 
and 20% of K2O in straw. One ton 
of rice straw contains about 5-8, 
1.6-2.7, and 14-20 kg of N, P2O5, 
and K2O, respectively.
• Reduce biodiversity and pollute 
the environmentThis practice 
should be 
avoided or 
banned if there 
are alternatives.
2Incorpora -
tion• Retains most of the nutrients in 
rice straw if there is enough time 
for aerobic decomposition (not 
decomposed anaerobically into 
methane).
• If rice straw is incorporated in 
flooded fields, it does not have 
enough time to decompose in 
aerobic conditions. It will produce 
methane and increase GHG 
emissions.The 
decomposition 
time for straw 
incorporation is 
at least 3 weeks.
3Collection 
of straw• Reduce emissions and obtain raw 
materials for use or converting 
into valuable products
• Scientific proof is that despite 
using machines, when we 
calculate the balance, we still 
reduce emissions and increase 
income for farmers.Use a straw baler 
for both wet 
and dry fields 
(see technology 
section below) Table 2. Options for rice straw management

4Mushroom 
cultivation• Yield: 5-10% of straw (50-100 
kg of mushrooms per ton of dry 
straw). Increase straw value and 
create healthy food.
• Vulnerable to the risk of yield loss 
due to difficulty in controlling the 
cultivation environment and straw 
quality
• Fresh straw mushrooms can only 
be sold within one day (cannot 
be preserved) so the market is 
limited.• Select straw 
and implement 
the technical 
practice 
according to 
the instructions 
(below)
• Straw 
mushroom 
residue 
continues to 
be used to  
make fertilizer, 
which is 
beneficial to the 
environment
5Cattle feed • The demand for using straw as 
fodder for cows is huge. Cows 
consume a daily amount of feed 
straw equivalent to 1.0-1.2 kg per 
100 kg of body weight
• The disadvantage of straw is 
that it contains silica and lignin, 
which interferes with digestion. In 
addition, the nutrients in the straw 
are also low.
• Straw is bulky and transportation 
costs are high.
• There have been a number of 
processing technologies to 
increase nutrition and digestibility 
and absorption of straw-made 
feed for cows and buffaloes.•  Select straw 
and implement 
the technical 
practice 
according to 
the instructions 
(below)
• Cow dung 
is used with

6Producing 
fertilizer 
from straw• One ton of rice straw contains 
about 5-8, 1.6-2.7, and 14-20 kg 
of N, P2O5, and K2O respectively. 
Using straw as fertilizer will make 
full use of nutrients, reduce 
CH₄ emissions in the field, and 
increase the value of straw.
• Mechanization technology 
combined with biology has 
proven to optimize the process 
of fertilizer production and the 
quality of fertilizer from straw.Use the process 
of mechanized 
rice straw 
composting 
described below.
7 Producing 
biochar • Biochar can be used to condition 
the soil, and it is a method of 
using carbon and avoiding CH₄ 
emissions.
• Straw contains a lot of carbon that 
can be used to create biochar by 
combustion - anaerobic method.
• However, this technology is 
limited by some difficulties, such 
as the high cost of collection 
and transportation, its bulkiness, 
and difficulty of furnace feeding. 
In addition, if the carbonization 
process is done on a small, 
simple scale in the field, it is 
easy to pollute and has very low 
efficiency.•  This technology 
is currently 
uneconomical 
because 
the cost of 
generating 
biochar is 
higher than its 
value.

8Making fuel 
to create 
energy• In principle, the calorific value of 
straw is close to that of rice husk 
(11-13 MJ/kg).
• Dry straw, if it is available on 
site, it can be easily burned for 
small-scale heat generation by 
farmers near the field.
• Straw is bulky, transportation 
costs are high, difficult for 
furnace feeding. In addition, 
when burning straw, straw ash 
is easily caked, causing clogging 
of the furnace, damaging the 
furnace.This solution 
is currently 
uneconomical 
and increases 
environmental 
pollution during 
transportation and 
burning of straw. 
9Heat-an -
aerobic 
decomposi-
tion to  
produce 
gas  
(pyrolysis)• In principle, straw containing 
a lot of carbon can be gasified 
under heating and anaerobic 
conditions to create gas 
products - bioenergy.
• Similar to the above problems, 
straw is bulky, transportation 
costs are high and feeding 
is difficult. Silica and lignin 
can interfere with the 
decomposition process
10Straw for 
biogas 
production• In principle, straw containing a 
lot of carbon can be converted 
into methane by biogas 
technology.
• However, straw is bulky, 
transportation costs are high 
and feeding is difficult; straw 
floats to the surface of the 
water. In addition, silica and 
lignin can interfere with the 
decomposition process.This technology 
is currently 
uneconomical, 
because the cost of 
generating biogas 
is higher than its 
value. In addition, 
if it is done on a 
small scale near 
the rice production 
site, it is easy to 
leak and pollute 
the environment.

14Based on a number of scientific evidence and practical applications 
presented in the reference, sustainable straw management and 
emission reduction can be achieved by collecting straw out of the 
field for production or converting it into products with higher value. 
At the same time, the direct or indirect residues from the use of rice 
straw should be treated and converted into energy and biofertilizer, 
among others, and reused for cultivation in line with the principle of 
circular economy.
The solution of rice straw management as circular agriculture (Figure 
5) is a handling solution that converts by-products or waste into main 
products or inputs of the biological cycle to help reduce waste to 
the environment and create a source of biofertilizer for cultivation. 
Removing straw out of the field to produce the abovementioned 
products will meet the requirements of sustainable straw management 
in the standard of sustainable rice production (SRP) and significantly 
reduce the carbon footprint of rice production on flooded lowland. 
The solution includes the following key criteria:
• No open-field burning of straw to avoid loss of nutrients, reduce 
environmental pollution, maximize maintenance of biodiversity, 
and ensure sustainable standards in rice production.
• No incorporation of raw straw in flooded fields to reduce CH₄ 
emissions.
• Collect straw out of the field and use it to produce straw-based 
products such as straw mushrooms, cow feed, biofertilizers, bio-
plastics, and urban agriculture products.
• Maximize the circulation of materials in production, such that 
there are only main products in agricultural production. 
5. Technical guidelines on the collection, handling, and use of 
rice straw
Page 21:
15Figure 5. Solution of circular agriculture based on rice straw 
This document only introduces the technologies and summarizes the 
main points of the technical processes. Technical details can be found 
in the reference documents and listed videos.
5.1. Collection of rice straw 
It is essential to move straw out of the field to ensure that there is 
a source of raw materials that can be used for other purposes in 
the circular agricultural chain. In the Mekong Delta, almost 100% of 
combine harvesters are used. It is difficult to collect manually the straw 
spread in the fields by the combine harvesters, so mechanization 
of straw collection is very necessary. This section briefly introduces 
technologies and mechanized options for straw collection in dry and 
wet fields. Straw balers are lighter than combine harvesters, so they 
do not cause significant damage to the arable soil layer.
Page 22:

Page 23:

Page 24:
185.2. Treatment of stubble in the field
Treatment of rice straw in the field should only be done when the 
collection cost is too high and uneconomical. On the other hand, 
incorporating rice straw under submerged (anaerobic) conditions 
can lead to methane (CH₄) emissions and increase greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions by up to 30% compared to collecting straw out of 
the field. The in-field solution is to incorporate straw in unsubmerged 
fields for at least 3 weeks. If the time between seasons is less than 
3 weeks, microbial inoculum should be sprayed to accelerate the 
decomposition of rice straw in the soil. This leads to additional costs 
during the processing. However, when rice straw is incorporated in the 
soil, if it has enough time to decompose, it will increase the organic 
and nutrient content of the soil, compared to burning in the field.

235.3. Use of collected straw
Collecting straw out of the field can reduce emissions by up to 30% 
compared to incorporating straw in submerged fields. However, 
unlike rice husk produced at a mill, straw must be collected in the 
field and is often high in humidity during wet seasons. Therefore, all 
economic and technological solutions for straw use must consider 
the nature of work, quality, and cost of straw collection, storage, and 
transportation.
General recommendation: Prioritize the use of straw from cultivated 
fields that have been managed according to good agricultural 
practices to limit the effects of pesticide residues, heavy metals, and 
other harmful microorganisms. In the case of rice production that has 
not yet applied good agricultural practices, at least the requirements 
for using pesticides must be met according to the four correct 
principles (type, dose, time, and method).
High-quality, dry straw (no mold and pesticide residues below the 
regulated threshold) should be collected and processed for cow feed. 
Straw that is dry and has not been decomposed or lost nutrients 
should be collected for mushroom cultivation. Mushroom cultivation 
residues, animal waste, and other organic wastes should be used to 
make organic fertilizers.
Some recently developed green technologies may be economically 
viable for bioplastic production, such as nursery pots or office planters, 
due to the high demand for environmentally friendly green products.
This section introduces a number of technology solutions and practices 
that are popular and have been successfully tested or applied in the 
Mekong Delta.
Page 30:
245.3.1. Mulching in crop production 
Collected straw can be used as a mulching material for crops. This is 
a simple, inexpensive, and labor-saving method.
Mulching straw around the crop root zone has several benefits, 
including:
• Inhibiting weed germination by limiting light and space, which 
can reduce the need for herbicides.
• Maintaining soil moisture by limiting evapotranspiration in the 
dry season and preventing erosion and leaching of the surface 
soil layer. Straw can also improve drainage in the rainy season 
and help to regulate soil temperature fluctuations (both daily 
and seasonally).
• Maintaining soil porosity by preventing the soil from drying out, 
cracking, or compacting due to direct sunlight.
• Providing an organic source for the soil when the straw is com-
pletely decomposed, which can help to increase the biodiversity 
of the rhizosphere microbiota

295.3.2. Mushroom cultivation  
Straw can be used to grow mushrooms to meet the increasing 
demand in the market. Straw from rice fields that have been managed 
according to good agricultural practices should be used to limit 
the effects of pesticide residues, heavy metals, and other harmful 
microorganisms. After harvesting the mushrooms, the straw residue 
should be reused to make growing medium or organic fertilizer.
This section introduces two methods of mushroom cultivation: 
outdoor mushroom cultivation and indoor mushroom cultivation 
(based on the studies of Le Vinh Thuc et al., 2020).

385.3.3. Fodder for buffaloes and cows
Using feed materials from straw, hay, post-harvest corn stalks, or 
other agricultural by-products to make feed for buffaloes and cows 
has been a long-standing practice that helps farmers have a stable 
source of raw fodder, overcoming fodder shortages in the dry season 
or in flooded areas. The application of this technique to production 
has contributed to better reuse of available fodder resources on 
the spot to develop sustainable buffalo and cow husbandry in the 
direction of circular and ecological agriculture.
This section introduces the method of composting straw to increase 
the digestibility and nutrient absorption of the treated straw to make 
fodder for buffaloes and cows.

Page 46:
405.3.4. Bio- bedding for livestock
The application of microorganisms in animal bedding has only 
recently been applied in Vietnam, but the similar technical process 
in other countries is that microbial inoculants effectively ferment to 
decompose high-fiber materials. Bedding materials include sawdust, 
rice husk, corncob, coir, etc., especially straw with high fiber, soft, and 
less irritating. The composition, quantity, and quality of microbial 
strains vary from country to country, product, and livestock species.
In developed and developing countries, the application of isolated 
and selected microorganisms for animal husbandry as well as bio-
bedding will be a potential application in organic and ecological 
livestock production and ensure animal rights in the coming years.
This section introduces the common method of using straw as bio-
bedding for livestock in Vietnam.

Page 48:
425.3.5. Production of organic fertilizer and growing medium
Composting is the process of converting organic matter, such as rice 
straw and other agricultural by-products (rice husk ash, dust impurities 
from rice milling, livestock waste, stems or leaves, etc.), into decayed 
organic fertilizers. Low-quality straw or wet straw and agricultural by-
products can be used to produce organic fertilizers.
Collecting straw for composting not only increases the value of straw, 
but it also reduces GHG emissions by more than 20% compared to 
straw incorporation in flooded fields. Additionally, straw collection 
(not burning straw) is one of the important criteria for meeting the 
standards of sustainable rice production and reducing emissions, 
increasing income from rice production.
In terms of technology, IRRI and its partners have developed 
mechanized straw composting technology to produce organic 
fertilizer and have successfully tested it in Vietnam. This is a technology 
that integrates physical effects (mixing by machine), biological effects

 pg. 2               Background:  Digitalization in Agriculture (including Analytics, AI, Robotics) is transforming existing business processes and enabling new means to deploy innovative services and products at an unimaginable scale and pace.   Digital agriculture has a much broader scope with the potential use in the areas of supply chains, access to finance and markets, contextual advisory, building farmer networks etc. The term fourth agricultural revolution is also used interchangeably with digital agriculture - the use of digital and precision tools across agriculture – where hyper spectral satellites, IOT, robotics, AI etc are being used in agriculture and allied sectors and are giving rise to innovations across all stages of the food, inputs and water value chain.  Project Goal   The goals for an Agri stack for Uttar Pradesh should include:   1. Increase Agricultural Productivity: By providing farmers with actionable insight through access to real-time data on weather conditions, soil health, and crop yields, and help make better decisions about planting, irrigation, and fertilization.   2. Improve livelihoods: Improve farmers' livelihoods by connecting them with markets and buyers, and help them sell their produce at better prices.   3. Enhance Resilience: Improve financial resilience through insurance products as well as to climate change by identifying areas that are most vulnerable and using Data and information to protect their crops.   4. Digitization of Agriculture and farmers: The project should aim to digitize agriculture and farmers by creating a digital platform that allows farmers to access important information and connect with buyers and the government.   5. Improve the Agri economy and hence overall economic condition of Farmers: Increase agricultural productivity, profitability, and resilience for farmers and have a significant impact on the overall economy.   6. Enhancing Farmer Trust and Digital literacy: Improve the acceptability of digital solutions and technologies by the farmers through improved accreditation, validation of Ag Tech claims and improved digital literacy.  7. Balancing Farmers interests for Data confidentiality and economic benefit: Ensure that the Farmer data is not misused and the Farmers / State / National interests are protected. At the same time, while protecting confidentiality, ensure that Agri Data is leveraged for its economic potential and a regulated but commercially viable Agri Data market place is created across the Govt, Private sector and the Farmer.   Alignment of AgriStack and DataStack:  There has been a lot of work done by the Central and State Governments, Academic, Research Institutions, and the Private Sector in conceptualising different approaches and aspects of an “AgriStack” to transform Indian Agriculture. An AgriStack is envisioned as an “enabling framework of Services (applications) and Agri Data around a data exchange”, built to support several Agri use cases, while encouraging application and data interoperability using well defined interfaces.   A well designed AgriStack will help reduce duplication by integrating data sources and a vast backend of new and existing applications: Govt’s eNam, ITC’s eChoupal, NCDEX’s NeML, APEDA’s TraceNet, etc related to logistics, weather, supply-chain, warehousing, assaying, recommendation engines, etc.  There is a need to integrate into all this a focussed discussion and engagement on an Open Agri Data Stack which forms the backbone of the AgriStack aligned to the several critical use cases chosen by the State Government of Uttar Pradesh.  At the core of Digital Agriculture is an increasing amount of live and real-time “Data” which is being rapidly generated by both - the Government through its farmer friendly programs (including DBT and other schemes) and also the Private Sector as a by-product of business applications or through remote sensing (satellite imagery). Physical maps being digitized is an example, while another is through the multiplicity of payment and Agri trading platforms. In addition, there is a rapid increase in precision farming applications generating “machine-data” from:    • Drones / UAV (e.g. real-time monitoring of farms enabling mapping, surveying, 3D modelling)  • Satellites and remote sensing (providing direct farmer advisory, for yield estimation, early pest warning etc.) 
  
Open DataStack to power Government of Uttar Pradesh’s AgriStack  
Page 3:
 
 pg. 3 • Robotics (e.g. nutrient injection, harvesting, targeting high precision weed removal) • Automated Material Handling  (e.g. harvesting equipment, grain/food processors) • Farm sensors and management (e.g. for soil moisture, water and nutrient injection) • Mobile cameras (e.g. for identifying pest, nutrient deficiencies)  This mountain of data, once anonymised, aggregated and processed can be re-purposed using AI for different use cases - raising yields, optimising national resources and doubling farmer income.  Approach to a Data Stack for Uttar Pradesh:  Given this context, this approach paper, seeks to lay down some practical suggestions to start with – using which we can to contribute to the Farmer’s benefit as well as the broader debate on an AgriStack architecture and the specific data building blocks needed.   Through this process we will need to understand and uncover both the explicit and the implicit expectations of the Government of Uttar Pradesh and several interested entities (Public, Private, Research, and Academia) from the AgriStack and translate these into defining and designing a data stack reference design that becomes the core building block of the proposed AgriStack. Ultimately, this will need work across multi-stakeholder interest groups to enable deeper clarity in understanding and defining “Open Agri Data” for the AgriStack and help converge ideas and actions.  Use Case led approach:  Very often attempts to work on complex, multi-year Agri problems, however well-intentioned (and regardless of how these attempts begin) end up adopting a “technology first”, feature focussed approach, sometimes driven by a specific company’s solution.   Instead we suggest, adopting a farmer-centric use case approach, with the use cases prioritised carefully by the Government for maximum societal impact. This allows the Government to coalesce several related Agri technologies and overlapping Ag Tech Start-ups together for working on the use case.  This shift in focus, though subtle, requires tough implementation focus to hold course, but produces long term sustainable results.   Elements to consider for aligning an Agri Data Stack to an Use Case led approach:  We recommend, that to inject more specificity, engagement be held as suggested above, in line with key use cases identified by the State Government, which they wish to be enabled by AgriStack and the consequent Agri Data Stack. We need to identify several objectives for each use case, focussing on specific data elements needed for each:  a) Build a 360° view of the “problem statement” for the Use Case with a “To-Be” state for the short / medium / long term. b) Identify the strategic levers needed to solve the use case. c) Identify Data elements and then the consequent Data sets needed for each strategic lever. d) Identify the sources of Data sets / elements with a view of authenticating the data.  Discussion around each use case will focus on answering the following types of questions (illustrative, not comprehensive):  1) What data (spatial and temporal resolution) is needed for the use case to be deployed for a farmer? 2) What data is currently available with central Govt. or the state Govt. or private enterprises? 3) What are the data gaps for this use case to be enabled at the desired level of scale and granularity? 4) How can these data gaps be filled? Does the Govt. need to revamp or adapt existing data collection methods or incorporate  secondary or private data sets to fill these gaps? 5) What are the building blocks for each use case which can developed in open source as a Digital Public Good (DPG)? 6) How to build the Agri Data Stack while being cognizant of data governance standards – access, privacy, interoperability, quality and incentive for the data owners? 7) Who are the diverse stakeholders who could play a role in each of the thematic areas? 8) What are the policy measures required to make the data based digital tools deployment beneficial for the Indian farmers?   Integrating State Govt’s Use cases with Public & Private data sources through an Agri Data Stack:  Some key areas of interest to the Government of Uttar Pradesh:  1) Credit and Rural finance for the smallholder farmers. 2) Actionable and context specific advisory for farmers, especially to prevent pest and disease. 3) Market Linkages and Price forecasting to reduce food wastage.  Process steps for UP State Govt to AgTechs and Data Stack for different types of use cases:  Adopting a use-case-led approach requires identifying and mapping data sets needed for Agri technologies provided by start-ups. Identification and validation of these use cases and the shortlisting of startups to implement solutions in turn needs thorough research and review of the market dynamics, the existing startup landscape, and their tech capabilities/solutions. Scoping of the Use case, identifying strategic levers associated to the use case, technology/capabilities maturity and the adoption of emerging technologies can be a few parameters in evaluating startups to participate in a Data Stack Project.

 pg. 4  Based on these parameters, and feedback from other Stat es, we suggest three categories of use cases that require slightly different approaches in evaluating and selecting the right technology partner for the pilot and eventually the implementation. These categories are briefly described below:  1. “Broad Scope” Use Cases: These are problem Identification and selection of start-ups to work on Broad Scope Use Cases can be done by floating a request for proposal. The scope can be narrowed down to suit the requirements of the use case. Advanced validation is needed to identify the top 2 or 3 start-ups post the evaluation and shortlisting of proposals. An example of a broad-scope Use Case can be Farmer Credit, Market access, Actionable Advisory, Irrigation, etc.  2. Narrow Scope Use Case: Use Cases that are narrow in scope are those that typically could serve to be building blocks as a part of several other use cases. For instance, Electronic Farm Records, Crop acreage etc are relatively narrow in scope and could be used as building blocks for several “Broader” use cases. These would require a request for a limited “discover pilot” to assess the specific usability and technical capabilities of the start-ups. Working with a limited number of start-ups who could carry out a pilot to meet the requirements is a way forward.   3. Emerging Tech-Based Use Cases: Solutions on emerging technologies require considering various use cases to apply the technology. This can help review and narrow down the capabilities and also allows the start-ups in showcasing and demonstrating their technologies. An example can be the use of Robotics for various use cases like the plucking of cotton, precision seeding, removing weeds, etc  The process steps for all three categories of use cases in the implementation of a Data Stack are shown below (refer to Diagram 1).

 pg. 6  Annexure1: Strategic considerations for an Agri Data Stack:   Digitization of Agriculture and Agri Data often raise questions about Data Interoperability (standardisation, calibration, certification), policies, privacy, regulation, data sharing, scope, sources (including govt and private), farmer trust, data confidentiality, and data governance. Even though these are initial days for the State Govt of UP’s work on Agri Data Stack, below are some important considerations that merit discussion in the context of a Data Stack:  • Agricultural Data Interoperability:  Given the overall potential for the Agri sector, it is important for us to ensure an enabling, transparent and well governed  framework for data, information, and domain knowledge sharing to allow all players to succeed and grow. Agriculture’s economic viability will improve via democratized and streamlined access to finance, advisory, supply chain, and markets.   The Agriculture sector is plagued by dozens of siloed software applications and islands of data, providing little benefit. Disaggregated and non-standardized data is deemed un-trustworthy and rendered partially ineffective for further processing. Standardization will help improve “data-trust” furthering automation using AI models, also avoiding real-world biases creeping into AI prediction. Agri data interoperability across the Government and the private sector will incubate new business models (Agri and non-Agri) providing transformative impact similar to how Aadhaar with UPI transformed digital payments..    • Involve the AgTech Ecosystem into creating an Agri Data Stack: Like in any digital innovation, digital agriculture also flourishes within an ecosystem. The existence of a spectrum of data is the key to spurring innovations in digital agriculture. The concepts of data hubs, data stacks, and data exchanges have emerged to enable a frictionless way of aggregation (data from different sources), organization, management, distribution, sharing, and sub-letting of data while enforcing data governance.    • Data governance will be crucial to engender Farmer and AgTech Trust A key challenge lies in finding a balance between leveraging the Data potential for the sector’s growth and farmers’ economic interests by fostering greater trust through carefully drafted State policies for monetisation, access, usage etc-  while protecting the Farmer privacy and confidentiality of agricultural data.   State level Data usage policies should be framed for several tricky issues like personal vs public ownership, shared monetization, portability, oversight and protection, processing rights, inter-operability standards, etc., keeping these in context of newly introduced terms in the centrally drafted “Data Protection Bill” like Data “Controller”, “Processor”, “Principal”, “Trustee or Custodian”.    These issues have been grouped below for simpler understanding and discussion:     1) Data Usage (ownership, access, monetization etc.),  2) Data Trust through data Interoperability (standardization, calibration certification), and enhanced focus on digital literacy. 3) Data Portability (across digital Agri service providers to enable a competitive environment)  For long term sustenance of these efforts, while we inject digital technology and innovation into Agriculture to drive growth and enable Farmers and Farming to become profitable, resilient, and sustainable - we must adopt sound data governance.  Much of this data pertains to small and marginal Farmers largely at the bottom of the financial and digital pyramid and hence we need to ensure they are not unknowingly exploited, financially bypassed by others using their farm data, for selfish business benefit and market manipulation.   • Regulatory Agri Sandbox can streamline Regulation and Innovation needs of the Government of Uttar Pradesh. An Agri Sandbox suitably designed can be a catalyst to help synthesise the often conflicting regulatory and Innovation requirements between the State Govt along and the Ag Tech Start Ups. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) / The World Bank Group, aspires to partner with the Government of Uttar Pradesh, to build and run India’s first Hybrid Regulatory Sandbox for Agriculture, created in a unique “Hub & Spoke” arrangement.   This will help scale-up AgTechs by removing inhibitors and advancing key policy, regulatory, innovation enablers that enhance AgTech competitiveness, scale and impact to the State’s Agriculture within a four-year project period.   Within this project we will seek to:  a) increase the number of AgTechs in the State, across the entire agricultural value chain b) increase revenue for AgTechs operating in the State,  c) increased number of AgTechs graduating from early stage to commercial scale.   • Data Partnerships will accelerate innovation  Efforts to harness this dataflow and facilitate “data partnerships” between Government of Uttar Pradesh and AgTech Start-ups, Corporates, Research, Academia based on either direct or indirect business benefit will accelerate the penetration of innovation.

 pg. 7 This will create new business models and partnerships across the value-chain (insurance, market access, assaying etc.)that help monetise data further contributing to improved productivity and profitability of  Agriculture and other sectors as well.   Annexure2: Illustrative Approach using Use Case: Credit and Rural finance for the smallholder farmers  Problem Statement  Simplify Agri loan assessment for Small/Medium farmers to facilitate loan products at minimal cost in the shortest period and help lenders mitigate their risk, monitor credit usage, and improve loan recovery.  Context • A holistic approach towards Agri Finance and credit to extend purpose-neutral Loans based on digital assessment, backed by insurance. • Consider cash flow lending acknowledging the collective economic need of rural households. • Streamline process by leveraging tech to democratize farmer outreach and minimize touch points by embedding all regulatory & KCC requirements in the system.  Aspects to consider • Creating a Digital Profile/Identity of the Farmer (reliable, digital, private, anonymous) • An end-to-end approach - farmers avail loan/credit, secure crop insurance and exit by selling produce  loan repayment. • Use data from multiple sources – farmer, government, autonomous, digital, manual, to assess the farmer after consent. • Credit assessment of the farmer to be linked to the farmer's household’s credit history including loans from microfinance, NREGA, NBFCs, banks, savings, insurance, and cash flows, to increase visibility of savings and assessing financial discipline. • Credit/Loan products to be created based on history of loan payments and savings. • Cash flow lending; and direct payment to supplier (vs cash to farmer) and recover dues in bullet repayments (vs EMI) • Motivate lenders to expand the loan book and reduce NPAs by improving usage visibility. • Validate the Risk Scores with assessment on the ground. • Break current barriers of physical proximity of a branch/office of the lender in managing the credit lifecycle.

One of the key components of this project  is “Access and Benefit Sharing” (ABS). As part of the project, a policy study was done with the  aim of gathering experiences and perceptions on different access and benefit sharing regimes in  partner countries and the institutional networks for ABS with the aim of harmonizing ABS across the  region and establishing a network for sharing in situ genetic resources (of wild plant species) including  CWRs. The study involved a review of existing policy frameworks and a survey of key actors in 22 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa. This  harmonization  report  presents  findings  of  the  study  and  is  aimed  at  providing  common  information base for participants attending the Virtual Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) Workshop.  The study revealed that there are different policy regimes for ABS of CWRs that are governed by  principles of both the Nagoya Protocol and the ITPGRFA. As such, it is important for countries to  implement both international policy instruments in a mutually supportive manner.

 Executive Summary  
 
The Darwin Initiative funded project “Bridging Agriculture and Environment: The Southern African 
Crop Wild Relatives Network” aims at establishing strategic partnerships  and networks of protected 
areas for Crop wild relatives ’ (CWR) conservation and use . One of the key components of this project 
is “Access and Benefit Sharing ” (ABS) . As part of the project , a policy study was done with the 
aim of  gathering experiences and perceptions on different access and benefit sharing regimes in 
partner countries and the institutional networks for ABS with the aim of harmonizing ABS across the 
region and establishing a network for sharing in situ  genetic resou rces (of wild plant species) including 
CWRs.  The study involved a review of existing policy fram eworks and a survey of key actors  in 22 
countries in East ern and Southern Africa.  
This harmonization report presents findings of the study  and is aimed at provi ding common 
information base for participants  attending the Virtu al Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) Workshop . 
The study revealed  that there are different policy regimes for ABS of CWRs that are governed by 
principles of both the Nagoya Protocol and  the ITPGRFA . As such , it is important for countries to 
implement both international policy instruments in a mutually supportive manner . Few countries have 
harmonized their laws to implement both th e ITPGRFA  and N agoya Protocol  in a mutually inclusive 
man ner, Madagascar presents such an example. Other countries have also established institutional 
coordination measures to simplify the process of accessing CWRs and in situ plant materials . The 
results of this paper have been  discussed to  stimulat e discussion on knowledge gaps and next steps in 
ABS harmonization in the  SADC  region.

 1. Introduction  
The primary purpose of this discussion  paper  was to provide a  common information base for 
participants attending the Virtu al Access and Benefit Sharing  (ABS)  of crop wild relatives in southern 
and eastern Africa Workshop  (ABS workshop, in short) , which was held on 21st and 22nd of February 
2022 .  
The objective s of ABS workshop were  to: 
• raise awareness about the influence of ABS laws on the availability and use of  crop wild 
relatives  (CWR ) for agricultural research and development.  
• identify options for  promot ing the implementation of both the Nagoya Protocol and ITPGRFA  
from organization al and community to subregional levels, i n ways that support for the 
conservation, availability and use of CWR and equitable sharing of benefits derived from those 
uses.  
This document also i dentif ies knowledge gaps  about ABS laws and policies at national levels in SADC 
and eastern Africa regions  that participants  were expected to fill both during the workshop , and 
afterwards if necessary . As you will see below, in preparation for this workshop, organizers have 
gather ed and synthesized a lot of  useful information . However, they have also identified some areas 
where it would be very useful to have more information . These issues or gaps are flagged at the end 
of the paper and have  been addressed , at least in part, during the workshop.    
The remainder of th is discussion paper is divided into the following sections. Section 2 describe s the 
status of CWR in southern  and eastern  Africa , and challenges associated with their conservation and 
sustainable use . Section 3 introduces access and benefit sharing laws, with a particular focus on the 
Nagoya Protocol1 and the multilateral system created by the ITPGRFA2. This section also provides a 
checklist of issues that need to be addressed in national measures implementing the ITPGRFA  and the 
Nagoya Protocol to ensure that the  boundary between their respective scopes is clear, and to ensure 
coordinated, mutually supportive implementation in ways that s upport the conservation and 
sustainable use of crop wild relatives . In Sections 4 and 5 , we present the results of our research 
concerning the actual state of national level implementation of both agreements in 22 countries in 
the SADC region and East Africa.  In Section 4, we present the results of a desk study of those countries ’ 
relevant laws and regulations. In Section 5, we present the results of a survey we conducted of 
relevant stakeholders in the countries concerning their experiences working in compliance with 
national access and benefit sharing measures . In Secti on 6, we set out conclu sions based on the 
forgoing sections, including some options for ways forward at the sub regional level . 
The research activities described in this paper, and the ABS workshop are suppo rted by the project 
entitled “Bridging Agriculture and Environment: the Southern African Crop Wild Relatives Network” 
which is funded by DEFRA UK/ Darwin Initiative and coordinated by the  Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT, 
in cooperation with SADC Plant Gene tic Resources Centre  (SPGRC)  and University of Birmingham . 3

3The objectives of “Bridging Agriculture and Environment: the Southern African Crop Wil d Relatives Network” 
are: to establish strategic partnerships/networks of protected areas/genetic reserves for crop wild relatives 
(CWR) conservation and use; to design incentive mechanisms to enhance the benefits farmers from conserving 
CWR; to increase t he availability and use of  CWR germplasm and sharing of derived benefits through mutually  
supportive implementation of the  Nagoya Protocol and the Plant Treaty’s multilateral system of access and

 One of the key objectives  of th is project has been to establish a regional network for the in situ  
conservation and use of CWR within the SADC region. A white paper  for the establishment of this 
network  was developed that has been  endorsed by the SADC Joint meeting of ministers of agriculture 
and food security, fisher ies and aquaculture at their May 2021 sitting  (Dulloo et al., 2021) . The SADC 
CWR n etwork aims to increas e the c onservation and sustainable use of CWR diversity by fostering 
complementary connections between the in situ  network and the ex situ  conservation network of 
national gene banks and the SPGRC.  The function s of the network are to  enhance conservation an d 
sustainable use of CWR diversity,  enhance partnership  between holders and users of CWRs and 
address ABS policies to facilitate access to in situ  conserved materials and benefit sharing governed 
by the Nagoya Protocol and the ITPGR FA, as well as to facilitate access to and exchange of data and 
information . 
2. Crop wild relatives in Southern  and Eastern  Africa   
Crop wild relatives (CWR)  are wild plant species that are closely related to domesticated species, 
include crop progenitors and are a potential source of traits beneficial to our crops  (Maxted et al., 
2006) . Given their importance for agricultural research and development, their conservation is of high 
priority, in particular their in situ  conservation that allows c ontinued evolution of new adaptive traits 
as well as the maintenance of the breadth of genetic diversity present in the many CWR species 
(Thormann et al., 2013) . CWR are either mostly conserved in formally or informally designated 
protected areas (PAs) tha t are either privately or publicly managed; they can also be found outside 
PAs and in private and public ex situ  collections of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture 
(PGRFA).   
The eastern and southern African regions are home to many CWR species that have a  relatively close 
genetic relationship to crops that are cultivated for food, beverage, forage, fodder, forestry, 
ornamental, medicinal, environmental,  and other uses . The sou thern Africa region alone hosts  nearly 
1,900 wild plant species related to crops such as coffee, cucurbits, eggplant, lettuce, millets, okra, 
pulses, rice, sorghum,  and watermelon (Allen et al., 2019) , while East  Africa hosts about 1,600 wild 
plant species  of most sorghums, finger millets, beans, bananas, sweet potatoes and cowpeas (e.g. , 
Ahmad et al., 2021; Edwards, 1991; Okeno et al., 2012) . Untended by humans, CWR continue to evolve 
in the wild , developing traits – such as drought tolerance or pest resis tance – that farmers and 
breeders  can cross with domesticated crops to produce new varieties  (Maxted et al., 2006)  and have 
been recognized as a vital resource for crop improvement and ensuring the food and nutrition and 
economic security by several countries in the region (e.g. Ethiopia, (Edwards, 1991) , Malawi, (Mponya 
et al., 2020) , Mauritius (Bissessur et al., 2019) , South Africa (Holness et al., 2019) , Zambia (Ng’uni et 
al., 2019) . Of the 1,900 taxa in southern Africa, 745 CWRs have been identified as related to the 64 
crops and forages that are included int the multilateral system of access and benefit sharing 
(multil ateral system) created by the I TPGRFA  and 100 of these are of immediate priority for 
conservation action  (Allen et al., 2019) . 
There are two levels of challenges relat ed to the conservation and sustainable use of CWR , where the 
SADC CWR network could play an important role  in address ing them . First ly, there is the risk  of loss or 
extinction of CWR  species  in the region , driven by climate change, anthropogenic habitat conversion 
and degradation and impacts of invasive alien species (Allen et al., 2019) . These CWR species  are 
generally not wel l-known to  protected areas managers and other  land managers and are not targeted 
or consider ed in the  management plans and  site management  practices.  Thus, active conservation of 
 
benefit -sharing; and to increase capacity of organizations  in Southern Africa to work together on in situ  
conservation and sustainable use of CWR .

 populations in their natural habitats and in genebanks has not received due attention , leading to 
erosion . There is a need to raise awareness of land managers about the CW R species  generally and 
their importance to food security  to ensure that the CWR diversity is safeguarded . Secondly , the lack 
of access to diversity of CW R in the wild and in genebanks has greatly limited the use of these genetic 
material of CW R for crop improvement  by breeders, who generally obtain  their germplasm from 
genebanks. In fact, a gap analysis undertaken by Mag os Brehm et al. ( in press ) has shown that CWR s 
are generally not  well conserved in  the regions ’ national and regional (SPGRC) genebanks. 
Consequently, there is a need to create incentives for conservation of these species.  One important 
means of creating such incentives is to require  R&D organizations to equitably share the benefits they 
derive fro m their use of those materials with organizations and farmers who conserve them (Sirakaya, 
2019).  Access to CWR (both  in situ  and ex situ ) is vital to support sustainable agricultural development.  
However, breeders and other genetic resources users often are unable to access them.  
3.0 Overview of the International legal  and policy  frameworks for 
access and benefit sharing of PGRFA4 
Acces s and benefit sharing laws are meant to ensure that b enefits that arise from conducting research 
and development on genetic resources  -- especially commercial R&D  -- are shared equitably  with 
provid ers of those  resources (Greiber  et al., 2012) . The benefits may be monetary or non -monetary  
(including, potentially technology transfer, capacity development, exchange of information ). As we 
shall see, the CBD and its Nagoya Protocol  on one hand, and the ITPGRFA  on the other, adopt very  
different approaches to access  and benefit sharing.     
Access to CWR within a country, and sharing benefits derived from their use, could potentially be 
governed by a wide range of laws and policies, including purely home -grown access and benefit 
sharing rules, rules for management of conservation areas, and so on. In this paper, we will focus 
primarily on measures developed to participate in the ITPGRFA ’s multilateral system of access and 
benefit -sharing, and national measures to implement the Nagoya Protocol. As we will see below, the 
answer to the question ‘do national measures implementing the Nagoya Protocol or the ITPGRFA  
apply to crop wild relative s?’ depends upon a combination of factors. The most fundamental factor is 
whether the country has measures in place to implement either  or both of those international 
agreements. Thereafter, assuming they do have implementing measures  for both agreements , the 
answer depends upon a detailed consideration of the following factors: the species involved, the 
purpose for which they are being accessed, where they are located, who is managing them, and the 
conditions under which they may have previously been trans ferred. All these factors will be 
considered in more detail below. But first, we want to provid e an introductory overview of the most 
important aspects  of the Nagoya Protocol and the ITPGRFA ’s multilateral system. Many of the 
workshop participants will alr eady be familiar with these two international legal instruments, and a 
great deal has been written about them already , so our review here will be brief, just to make sure 
everyone is familiar with the critical aspects of both agreements.  
3.1 The C onvention on Biological Diversity  and Nagoya Protocol  
The natural starting point for an historical overview of international access and benefit sharing laws is 
the Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD) which came into  force in 1993. The CBD has three ma in 
 
4 Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture  consist of diversity of seeds and planting materials of 
traditional varieties and modern cultivars,  crop  wild relatives, and other wild  plant  species. These  resources  are 
used as  food , feed for domestic animals, fibers, textiles, and energy.

 objectives : the conservation of genetic resources; the sustainable use of genetic resources and its 
components , and the equitable sharing of benefits arising from utilization of resources.  CBD 
contracting parties agree to take measure s to conserv e genetic resources in both in situ and ex situ5 
conditions . Article 15 of the CBD sets out rules which govern access to genetic resources and benefit -
sharing  whereby contracting parties agree to put in place systems that facilitate access to genetic 
reso urces for environmentally sound purposes and ensure that the benefits resulting from their use 
are shared fairly and equitably between users6 and providers. To gain access, users must first get prior 
informed consent (or PIC) on mutually agreed terms (MAT ) from the provider cou ntry.  The CBD 
currently has 196 contracting parties . Dissatisfaction with the impact of the CBD on benefit -sharing in 
particular led to the ne gotiation of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair 
and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) to the Convention on Biological 
Diversity  (Nagoya Protocol) . The main two new things that the Na goya Protocol does is: 1) provide a 
framework for international monitoring and enforcement of  users ’ compliance  with the access and 
benefit -sharing laws of the countries where they accessed genetic resources ( and/ or associated 
traditional knowledge) , 2) require users to obtain PIC and MAT from indigenous peoples and local 
communities (subject to national laws) when acquiring traditional knowledge associated with genetic 
resources.  The Nagoya Protocol on ABS was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan and 
entered into force on 12 October 2014  (CBD 2011).  Utilization is defined as  
“To conduct research and development on the genetic and/or biochemical composition of 
genetic resources, including through the application of biotechnology ”.  
Article 6 deals with ‘Access to Genetic Resources’. It states that in the exercise of its sovereign right , 
each contracting party agrees that access to genetic resources for ‘utilization ’ shall be subject to PIC 
granted by the provider country, unless otherwise de termined . “Unless otherwise determined”  mean s 
that contacting parties may opt out of regulating access to genetic resources in their countries – and 
many have done so, primarily European countries and Canada.  
Article 6(2) addresses  access to genetic resou rces managed by indigenous peoples and local 
communities (IPLCs) in particular “ where they have the established right to grant access to such 
resource” . The quoted disclaimer in the last sentence means that, in some counties, IPLC’s may not 
have such rights.  
Article 6(3) requires countries that regulate access to GR subject to PIC to  
“(a) Provide for legal certainty, clarity and transparency of their domestic access and benefit -
sharing legislation or regulatory requirements.  
(b) Provide  for fair and non -arbitrary rules and procedures on accessing genetic resources.  
(c) Provide information on how to apply for prior informed consent.  
(d) Provide for a clear and transparent written decision by a competent national authority, in 
a cost -effec tive manner and within a reasonable period;  
 
5 In situ conditions are where the genetic resources exist within ecosystems and habitats where they have 
developed distinctive properties (Article 2 of the CBD) and ex -situ where genetic resources are conserved 
outside their natural habitats such as in gene banks or botanical gardens (Article 2 of the CBD).  
6 Users of genetic resources include research institutes or co mpanies seeking access for basic scientific 
research or product development.  
Page 11:
5 
 (e) Provide for the issuance at the time of access of a permit or its equivalent as evidence of 
the decision to grant prior informed consent and of the establishment of mutually agreed 
terms, and notify the Acces s and Benefit -sharing Clearing -House accordingly ; 
(f) Where applicable, and subject to domestic legislation, set out criteria and/or processes for 
obtaining prior informed consent or approval and involvement of indigenous and local 
communities for access t o genetic resources; and  
(g) Establish clear rules and procedures for requiring and establishing mutually agreed terms. 
Such terms shall be set out in writing and may include, inter alia:  
(i) A dispute settlement clause;  
(ii) Terms on benefit -sharing, incl uding in relation to intellectual property rights;  
(iii) Terms on subsequent third -party use, if any; and  
(iv) Terms on changes of intent, where applicable. ” 
Article 8  on ‘Special Considerations’ states that  
“In the development and implementation of its a ccess and benefit -sharing legislation or 
regulatory requirements, each Party shall: […] (c) Consider the importance of genetic resources 
for food and agriculture and their special role for food security.”  
This provision exists to reflect the fact that it may be justifiable to adopt expedited procedures for 
granting access to PGRFA when important for food security. We will consider this possibility more 
below.  
The Nagoya Protocol establishes an ABS Clearing -House for the sharing of information on ABS. 
National competent authorities may submit ABS agreements (which include a prescribed set of fields) 
to the ABS Clearing -House .  
The Nagoya Protocol require s contracting parties to establish one or more “checkpoints ” to monitor 
users ’ compliance with ABS agreements and provider countries’ access and benefit sharing laws 
(Article 17.1). The checkpoints are meant to collect information from users about the sourc es of the 
genetic resources they are using, and assurance that they are using them in ways that comply with 
ABS agreements and laws. Parties are meant to establish mandatory disclosure requirements by users 
at these checkpoints.  There is considerable flexibility concerning what kinds of organizations can be, 
or should be, designated as checkpoints. They could be national patent offices, plant variety 
protection offices, or seed regulatory authorities. They could be organizations regulating the release 
of new products on commercial markets. They could be national agencies providing funding for 
research and development projects. The checkpoints submit information they gather to the Clearing 
House Mechanism created by the Nagoya Prot ocol. That information is then passed on to the 
competent authority in the country that granted access subject to an access and benefit sharing 
agreement  concerned.  
Under Article 13 of the Nagoya Protocol, each Party is obliged to designate a national foca l point (NFP) 
on access and benefit -sharing (ABS). Each Party has the liberty to decide which national institution will 
serve in that capacity. According to Paragraph 1 of Article 13, the NFP is responsible for making 
information on ABS available. It infor ms potential users of the procedures that are to be followed in 
applications for access to genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic 
resources. The NFP is also responsible for sharing information on competent national authorities 
Page 12:

 (CNAs) and relevant stakeholders. It is also the primary contact between the Party on behalf of which 
it acts, and the Conference of the Parties acting as the Meeting of the Parties (COP -MOP) to the  
Nagoya Protocol  (CBD, 2011).  
Article 13 further obliges each Party to designate at least one competent national authority (CNA) on 
ABS. The CNA has the responsibility to determine, authorize, and certify access in accordance with 
national ABS frameworks.  It is not mandatory to have both a NFP and a CNA (or CNAs ). A Party is free 
to designate only a NFP that will also serve as and carry out the responsibilities of a CNA – or vice 
versa. Whichever approach a Party opts for, it is important to notify the Secretariat about the 
designated NFP and CNA(s) as well as th eir responsibilities, and the information is then made available 
(by the Secretariat) through the Access and Benefit -sharing Clearing -House (ABS CH), as established 
under Article 14 of the Protocol.  
Where indigenous and local communities (ILCs) have the e stablished right to grant access to genetic 
resources, a Party is obliged in accordance with Article 6(3)(f) of the Nagoya Protocol to set out criteria 
and/or processes for obtaining their PIC or approval and involvement. It is the task of the NFP to make 
information available on such criteria and processes to applicants seeking to access genetic resources.  
The provision furthermore indicates that a CNA is the State institution that exercises the authority 
granted under Article 6(1) of the Nagoya Protocol t o determine access as well as conditions attached 
thereto on behalf of the Party that nominates it. The CNA(s) are thus charged with carrying out 
administrative duties in accordance with national legislation and regulatory requirements. According 
to Paragr aph 2, they perform the following functions:  
- Grant access – this will include fulfilling the obligations under Article 6(3)(d) of the  Nagoya  
Protocol.  
- Issue written evidence that access requirements have been met – for example, that PIC has

It unanimously adopted two resolutions welcoming CGIAR's capacity strengthening for NARES, and calling for additional support from donors for more.  The resolutions focused particularly on CGIAR's capacity strengthening for NARES a) to develop policies and b) to use digital sequence information (DSI) for agricultural R&D.  

Genebanks Initiative informed the Governing Body about CGIAR's capacity strengthening by:
-submitting a 20 page report to the Governing Body describing the assistance NARES need, and get, from CGIAR Centers to use DSI
-submitting another report describing CGIAR capacity strengthening for NARES'  genebank operations, and policy development 
-meeting with all the regional groups attending GB10 in the two days immediately before GB10 started, consulting about their capacity development needs,

 1. Introduction  
CGIAR submits this report in response to an open request from the Plant Treaty Secretar y, received June 
1, 2023 , for submissions regarding , a) contracting parties ’ and stakeholders ’ capacity building needs for 
accessing and using digital sequence information ( DSI)/genomic sequence data ( GSD ) and b) ‘technical 
assistance’ and ‘ actions taken ’ by stakeholders (including CGIAR) ‘ to reduce the existing gap on capacity 
regard ing DSI/GSD’.  
The primary objective of this paper is to respond to the second part of the request by shar ing information 
about how CGIAR Centers and Initiatives have  been assist ing organizations outside CGIAR to access, 
generate, share, analy se, and use DSI for the conservation of plant genetic resources for food and 
agriculture (PRGFA) and for the use of PGRFA in pre -breeding and breeding .1 This paper does not provide 
an exhaustive account of all of the Centers’  relevant activities, but it does provide a  general overview  of 
the kinds of activities in which the Centers have been engaged . CGIAR very much appreciates the 
Governing Body’s initiative, as expressed in Resolution 16/2022, to ask the Plant Treaty Secretariat to 
gather and synthe size information about both demand for, and supply of, capacity strengthening related 
to DSI  linked to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture , with the overall objective of working to 
close the capacity gap between developed and developing countr ies. It is our hope that, based on the 
outcomes of this exercise, CGIAR will be able to further adapt and improve its own approach to capacity 
sharing  in respon se to needs prioritized by the Governing Body.    
CGIAR has already submitted , to the Plant Trea ty’s Governing Body, the Conference of the Parties to the 
Convention on Biological Diversity (C BD) and the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and 
Agriculture ( CGRFA ), detailed reports concerning how CGIAR scientists are using DSI in their own 
conservation and crop improvement programs.2 We will repeat only as much of that information here as 
 
1 This paper does not address the unresolved issue of the definition of the term Digital Sequence Information (DSI). For the 
purposes of this submission, we are using the  term to refer to sequences derived from DNA or RNA ,  includ ing short and 
long reads an d all derived molecular markers such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Presence Absence 
variations, insertions and deletions (InDels), chromosomal translocations and rearrangements detected through 
sequencing and associated annotations setting out  current knowledge of the functions of different parts of the genome. 
This corresponds to the narrowest potential definition of DSI as set out by the CBD Secretariat (2020a), and comprises a 
subset of potential broader definitions . We have adopted this def inition for matters of convenience, because it 
corresponds to the scope of activities described in this paper. We do not want to be understood as taking a position on the 
scope of information that can or should be included in a definition of DSI that the i nternational could possibly adopt in the 
future. From this point forward in this paper, we will refer to DSI and not DSI/GSD.

 is necessary to set the context for our capacity strengthening engagement with organizations outside 
CGIAR .  
2. CGIAR  
CGIAR is a global research and innovation s partnership ;3 its mission is to deliver science and innovation 
that advance the transformation of food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis . The primary focus of 
CGIAR’s research and development are  resource -poor farmers and consumers  in developing countries . 
CGIAR seeks to  scale up  research  outputs and innovation s through capacity development  and policy  
advice, delivered through regional and global initiatives  in close  collaboration  with  partners  around the 
world , including national and regional research institutes, civil society organizations, academia, 
development organizations and the private sector.  
CGIAR includes 15 international agricultural research Centers, as depicted in Figure 1, with more than 
9,000 scientists working with more than 3,000 partner organizations in 90 countries around the world . 
Eleven of the Centers maintain, collectively more than 750,000 accessions of ‘in trust’ crops and forages , 
pursuant to agreements that those Centers signed with the Plant Treaty’s governing body in 2006. CGIAR 
Centers coordinate breeding programs for more than  25 crops , forages and trees.  
 
Figure 1 : map showing CGIAR Centers ’ locations  
As of January 1, 2022, CGIAR research is organ ized under three Action Areas: System Transformation, 
Resilient Agrifood Systems, and Genetic Innovation. Each Action Area is made up of Research Initiatives .

 Most research and development activities working directly with genetic resources for food and agr iculture 
and associated information (including DSI) take place under the Genetic Innovation  Action Area . This 
Action Area includes  the CGIAR genebanks , genomics research  and the plant breeding  programs.  
In the following sections  of this submission , we describe how the generation and use of DSI can be useful 
for the conservation and sustainable use of PGRFA , and we include examples of how CGIAR Centers 
provide assistance to other organizations to use DSI , either as partners  in CGI AR Research Initiatives , 
participants in training courses, or  as downstream use rs of the tools, technologies, methods, knowledge 
and data that CGIAR Centers have generated.  
The following sections of this paper are organized around fundamental activities o r steps that involve DSI , 
from deciding what materials to sequence and how  to sequence them , to using genomic tools in genebank 
operations , pre -breeding  and plant breeding  activities . Of course, in reality, these activit ies are usually not 
discrete. Most  of the efforts of CGIAR to assist other organizations using DSI do not focus on a single step  
as presented below , but address knowledge and technology gaps along comprehensive research and 
development chains.  
3. Generating DSI  
DNA sequence information is e xtremely helpful  for understanding genetic variability among cultivars and 
populations across and within species , and for  identifying  and deploying  key genes controlling important 
agronomic traits.  
Sequencing  and annotating  a genome accurately from scratch is time consuming and expensive. Although 
time and costs have been reduced dramatically in recent years, it remains expensive to undertake on a 
large scale. A single genome that has been sequenced with high accuracy and re liability may be used as a 
“reference genome” enabling cheaper low-cost high -throughput genotyping or resequencing ( using next 
generation sequencing  -NGS - approaches ) of many related genomes  to identify genetic diversity . This low -
cost genotyping and  reseq uencing data then becomes a recurrent and dynamic resource; new data can 
be added incrementally over time and re -used by multiple researchers simultaneously around the world 
for a wide variety of purposes including trait  discovery, mapping and incorpo ratio n into breeding 
programmes .  
In order to build the knowledge that they need in an efficient manner, research organizations must first 
address fundamental questions such as what to sequence and what for , and whether or not the desired 
genetic information ha s been already generated and is available . Depending on the answers to these 
questions, sequencing efforts may need to cover whole collections of PGRFA or subsets ; they may focus 
on whole genome resequencing or targeted sequencing; they may require more or less sequencing 
coverage and hence different technologies and expertise. Many research organizations located in  the 
developing countries lack the necessary infrastructure, expertise and knowledge to address these 
questions in an informed manner.

 CGIAR Centers and Initiatives deliver courses that include  training sessions aimed at improving decision -
making in relation to DSI generation and use in conservation and breeding activities. We present som e of 
these courses in subsequent sections of this paper. In addition  to these courses, medium to long term 
partnerships and collaborations between CGIAR Centers  and Initiatives , and national agricultural research 
organizations  often help strengthen the ca pacity of those partners to make informed decisions about 
what sequencing practices and genomic tools to use as part of their countries’ national conservation and 
plant breeding programs. Example s of these collaborations are presented below , in Box 1.  
Box 1: Supporting partner organizations with d ecision -making in relation to DSI generation and use  
Strategic advanced genotyping in Mozambique  
Collaborative activities between the CGIAR  (through the ‘Excellence in Breeding ’ Platform) , the International 
Cente r for Maize and Wheat Improvement ( CIMMYT ), the Instituto de Investigação Agrária de Moçambique 
(IIAM)  and Zambeze University have sought to implement effective genotyping  practices in the context of 
diversity characterization and crop improvement in the Zambezia, a central province of Mozambiqu e where 
periods of drought have become longer and more frequent.  
The collaboration included heterotic group characterization from the Mozambi que Genebank for 
improvement of ri ce, cowpea, and maize  populations in view of current production challenges.  
The collaboration contributed to better prioritization of genotyping efforts, faster delivery of results, and 
avoidance of work duplication among  institutions.  
Genotyping activities  in West Africa  for yams  (Nigeria, Ghana, Benin and Cote d’Ivoire)  
As part of the  ‘Excellence in Breeding ’ Platform of CGIAR, CGIAR Centers carried out the AfricaYam project , 
which  was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , and implemented together with national 
agricultural research organizations  in West Africa such as National Roots Crop Research Institute (NRCRI), 
Nigeria; Ebonyi State University, Nigeria; CSIR -Crops Research Institute  (CRI) , Gha na; CSIR -Savannah 
Agricultural Research Institute  (SARI) , Ghana; University of Abomey -Calavi, Benin Republic; and Centre 
National de Recherche Agronomique  (CNRA), Cote d’Ivoire . The project  developed strategies to select 
samples (both landraces and breeding lines ) for genotyping using advanced NGS technologies with the 
objective to advance  pre-breeding and breeding of yam in thes e countries.  
Through this collaboration, several yam genotypes  have been selected and genotyped and trait -marker  
associations have been established using GWAS (genome -wide association studies) and QTL (quantitative 
trait analyses) for several targeted traits . Several training programs have been organized for sample 
collection, sample preparation and data analyses for NARS partners. This coll aborative effort has provided 
platform to NARS partners to strategize their sampling efforts including selection of genotypes for genotyping 
and identification of duplicates across  different institutes.  
Not all organizations involved in PGRFA conservation and use can afford to have their own sequencing or 
genotyping platforms. In addition to acquiring the sequencing equipment and paying for its maintenance, 
organizations need to c over the costs of instruments, reagents and work that are necessary to process  
each sample (including, for example, instruments for n ucleic acid quantitation, quality analysis and 
isolation; instruments and expertise for library preparation ; and sequencing  reagents).  Moreover , to keep 
up with the rapid evolution of sequencing and genotyping technolog ies and avoid becoming dependent

 on old, slow, expensive equipment , they need to invest frequently in upgrading the equipment . 
Contracting external services is often more effective than ‘in-house ’ options, b ut the public genebanks 
and breeding programs do not always have access to the optimal services , lacking know ledge about 
providers, and not having sufficient demand for  sequencing or  genotyping to be able to negotiate 
advantageous terms. To address these gaps, CGIAR Centers and Initiatives offer sequencing and 
genotyping services , both  in-house and  through agreements with external providers , at low financial and 
administrative costs. Box 2 provides some details.  
Box 2: Sequencing services  
Center of Excellence in Genomics and Systems Biology  
The Center of Excellence in Genomics and Systems Biology of the International Crops Research Institute for 
the Semi Arid Tropics (CEGSB  of ICRISAT; https://cegsb.icrisat.org/ ) offers genomics and informatics services 
to CGIAR programs  and national research organizations on  a cost-to-cost basis.  The CEGSB houses genomics 
platforms including HiSeq 2500, MiSeq, ABI3730, Microarray Spotter & Scanner, and more. It also has a high -
performance computational analysis platform with 600 cores, 6 TB RAM, and 830 TB storage capacity. The 
services offered inc lude De novo  and re -sequencing of genomes, RNASeq/Transcriptome sequencing and 
small RNA sequencing, ChiP -Seq, Methylation/Bisulfite sequencing, SNP (KASPar assay) and SSR genotyping, 
DArT genotyping, qRT -PCR analysis, Sequence alignment and variant callin g, basic genome and transcriptome 
analysis and Genotyping -by-sequencing analysis. Until  now, CEGSB has generated 56 TB data  through 
sequencing DNA/RNA and 22 million datapoints from more than 16000 samples  using  different genotyping 
platforms. The objectiv e is to scale -up genomics applications in breeding and research at ICRISAT and partner 
organizations . 
ILRI's Genomics and Bioinformatics platforms  
The Genomics Platform of the International Livestock Research Institute  (previously the BecA -ILRI Hub) , 
which  is based in Kenya, offers standardized protocols and last -generation technologies to Africa -based 
research organizations and researchers. A wide range of services on offer  include nucleic acid extraction, 
quantification and amplification, library prepara tion, RT-qPCR analysis and DNA/RNA sequencing using 
Sanger, Illumina (MiSeq, HiSeq & NextSeq) and Oxford Nanopore (MinION & Flongle) technologies. In terms 
of molecular biology, the platform also offers DNA cloning, bacterial transformation, and transfection,  and  
random mutagenesis services and single -cell sequencing and gene expression analysis.  
ILRI’s Genomics platform is complemented with a Bioinformatics platform offering services which include 
data storage and data analysis using an on -site High -Performance  Cluster equipped with four  compute nodes 
totalling 128 CPU cores and 5,120 GPU cores for massively parallel computing. The team has developed a 
strong capacity in whole -genome sequencing and assembly at chromosome level, using various tec hniques to 
aid scaffolding (long reads, chromosome conformation capture) and to enhance genome annotation 
(transcriptomics, repeat analysis and masking, annotation transfer, etc).  
SAGA  
The Genetic Analysis Service for Agriculture (SAGA)  located at CIMMYT i s a research and service laboratory 
that uses the DArTseq method of genotyping, offering high, mid and low density DArTseq services for 
agriculture. The sequencer at SAGA can read up to 100,000 samples annually and generates large quantities 
of data at a c omparatively low price. SAGA provides genotyping services to national and international 
collaborators, including CIMMYT, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas 
Page 8:

 (ICARDA), the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT),  the Mexican Instituto Nacional de 
Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias (I NIFAP ), national genebanks in Latin America, private 
companies and universities. In addition to genotyping service , staff at SAGA offer support to clients to 
explore, un derstand and interpret data generated, facilitated through workshops, small group and 1:1 
training focusing on the appropriate generation, use and interpretation of genotypic data for research and 
germplasm development.  
CGIAR Initiative ‘Breeding Resources ’ 
The CGIAR Initiative ‘Breeding Resources’ negotiates contracts with  validated DNA extraction and genotyping 
service vendors based on anticipated bulk demand across eligible CGIAR and national agricultural research 
organizations. The Initiative receives a nd aggregates demands for genotyping to negotiate competitive 
genotyping prices with vendors, using one centralized administrative and contracting process. This simplifies 
paperwork and reduces the price of genotyping considerably. The CGIAR Initiative ‘Br eeding Resources’ has 
published manuals and video tutorials explaining how to make use of this service  effectively.  
The low -density genotyping service is based on Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP). Low -KASP genotyping 
is highly specific to a target: i t can be used for QC analysis, dropdown selection, marker assisted selection and  
forward breeding. The markers are known, validated and in use. They are in the public domain and accessible 
at https://excellenceinbreeding.org/module3/kasp . The list of markers is continuously updated and 
improved.  To illustrate the volume of this service, Figure 1 shows that 13,000 samples of 10 crops in 8 African 
countries were genotyped from September to December 2019.  
 
Figure 2. Number of samples, crops they belong to and provenance of the request for genotyping  through the 
Low-density KASP genotyping service in Sept ember -December 2019.  
The mid -density genotyping service is based on DArTag method  providing a fixed, pre -defined set of markers 
for select species . The service is primarily intended for genomic selection applications, but mid density panels 
can also be us ed for background recovery in marker assisted selection .  
By June 2023  mid-density DArT Ag panels have been implemented for co mmon bean , cowpea, groundnut, 
maize, pigeonpea , potato, rice, sorghum and wheat .  
Recently, h igh-density genotyping services have s tarted to be provided through a service agreement with 
Texas A&M University. This is being used for example in generating 3x skim -sequencing data on  rice samples 
for approximately $35/sample.

 4. Maintaining and analyzing DSI 
Bioinformatics tools to manage and analyze DSI data are essential for plant genome research. Many plant 
genome databases have been established and continue  to expand . Analytical methods based on 
bioinformatics are also well developed in many aspects of pla nt genomic research including comparative 
genomic analysis, phylogenomics, transcriptomics, genome -wide association stud ies, etc . The need to 
constantly upgrade computational infrastructures including high -capacity data storage  and high 
performing analysis  software , and the need to count on a skilled bioinformatics workforce  are challenges 
for the effective use of DSI . Many research organizations, often those located in developing countries, 
lack the necessary expertise and infrastructure to process large genomic datasets .  
Bioinformatics training in most parts of the world occurs primarily in university  programs which  are usually 
tailored for those who want to specialize in bioinformatics . To gain proficiency in programming languages , 
data management  and pr ocessing , which are essential for effectively handling various genomics -related 
tasks, bioinformatics training typically spans several months or even years. This comprehensive approach 
may not be optimal for individuals seeking to concentrate on a specific  area, such as analyzing genotyping 
data in plants. In such cases, it becomes crucial to have tailored training materials and tools that do not 
necessitate extensive bioinformatics expertise . Some CGIAR Centers provide short training s that equip

Bioinformatics and modern breeding methods courses at  ICRISAT by the Center  of Excellence in Genomics 
& Systems Biology (CEGSB)  
CEGSB of ICRISAT (https://cegsb.icrisat.org/ ) has continuously been engaged in building expertise in 
bioinformatics and computa tional biology to effectively analyse and interpret large scale sequencing and 
genotyping datasets. So far, CEGSB has conducted 16 training programs in the area of crop genomics and 
sequencing data analysis for national agricultural research organizations,  and trained  in total 492 participants 
from 36 countries  in the area of  crop breeding modernization and improvement . These training programs 
have also fostered collaborations and partnerships with different universities  and institutes to promote 
knowledge exchange, and resource and expertise sharing.     
Bioinformatics course s at ILRI  
Since 2013, ILRI has regularly organized short training courses on bioinformatics for African researchers in 
collaboration with other expert organizations, where participants are provided some form of scholarship.  
Capacity development in the  Genomics Platform of the International Livestock Research Institute  (previously 
the BecA -ILRI Hub ) includes  annual hands -on training workshops in key skill areas; research placements 
enabling early career scientists to spend up to six months at the Hub; and institutional support to key 
laboratories and individuals in the region. As part of network building, the hub has established 13 
communities of practice, linking African scientists of different disciplines with similar interests, some of them 
related to genomics.  Recently, two  unique and in -depth bioinformatics training programs have been 
implemented at ILRI Genomics Platform which aimed at helping early -career African res earchers harness the 
power of long -read DNA sequencing to unlock the genetic potential of crops and livestock in Africa. The 
second iteration of these training programs was entitled ‘3rd Generation Genomics and Bioinformatics in 
Page 10:

 Africa' and was jointly org anized by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI, Kenya), the John Innes 
Centre (JIC, UK) and the Earlham Institute (EI, UK) with support from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) 
Biotechnological and Biological Science Research Council (BBSRC) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It was 
delivered in three phases: ‘Develop’, ‘Demonstrate’ and ‘Deploy’. The 'develop' phase was a two -month long 
hybrid (residential and online) training program that introduces all the major steps in long -read sequencing  
from DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics analyses. The 'demonstrate' phase 
allowed for project -based learning where trainees got hands -on experience from three short projects. The 
'deploy' phase will extend the impact of th e training to the home institutions of the trainees across the 
continent. In this phase, the trainees will implement a long -read sequencing project they design themselves 
and will also train others in their home institutions.  
As a tangible output of these two in -depth training programmes in bioinformatics, the trainees have led an 
effort whose outcome  was the publication of the first chromosome -level genome for Lablab purpureus  
(hyacinth bean), and they are working on assembling and annotating complete genomes for two other 
neglected African crops, Sphenostylis stenocarpa  (African yam bean) and Dovyalis caffra  (kei apple). The 29 
early -career trainees of these two cohorts are no w occupying prominent positions in institutes with regional 
or continental reach in Africa and the Middle East, or completing their PhD studies.  
Bioinformatics Training Courses at IITA  
The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA ) conducts two  bioinformatics workshops annually, one 
as ‘Basic Bioinformatics Workshop’ and the other as ‘Advanced Bioinformatics Workshop’ . These workshops 
target research scientists, lecturers  and teachers, graduate students, technicians, and all those who require 
knowledge of bioinformatics within Africa and beyond. These workshops are being provided from 2019 and 
through applications from interested participants after the announcements is made every year twice. The 
registration fees for these courses are $100 for ea ch course and covers tuition fees, course materials and 
training certificate. The aim of these training workshops is to equip participants with the basic knowledge and 
skills of bioinformatics. These training comprises of 3 -day workshop that includes theor etical and hands -on 
training in basic bioinformatics techniques. Participants are also introduced to online repositories and trained 
on how to work with them. The ‘Basic Bioinformatics training course’ includes the following sessions: 
Introduction to Bioin formatics, Hands -on training on DNA repositories ( National Center for Biotechnology 
Information of the National Institutes of Health  -NCBI, the European Nucleotide Archive  -ENA , Hands -on 
training on protein repository (U niProt ), BLAST sequence alignment, H ands -on BLAST search, PCR primer 
design and evaluation, Phylogenetics tree construction, Introduction to next generation sequencing, and 
Introduction to RNA -seq data analysis. At the end of the training, the participants are evaluated based on 
their experi ence in the use of online tools like BLAST for sequence search, knowledge and experience in 
primer design and evaluation, and knowledge and experience in the use of online repositories. Similarly, the 
‘Advanced Bioinformatics training course’ includes sess ions such as Analysis of next -generation sequencing, 
RNA -sequence analysis, Metagenomics analysis, De -novo sequencing, and Gene annotations. At the end of 
this training, participants are evaluated based on their knowledge and experience on analyzing and 
interpreting genetic data and information.  
CABANA project  
The project ‘Capacity building for bioinformatics in Latin America’ (CABANA) was designed to strengthen local 
capacity for data -driven biomolecular research by creating a sustainable capacity -building  program focusing 
on three challenge areas – communicable disease, sustainable food production and protection of 
biodiversity. CABANA was orchestrated by an international consortium of ten organi zations - nine in Latin 
America (including the International Potato Center - CIP) and one in the UK. The project promoted 
Page 11:

 networking, collaboration and open sharing of information. CABANA activities included: 1) Secondment of 
Latin American scientists to the European Bioinformatics Institute; 2) Train the trainer ac tivities to 
disseminate knowledge; 3) Workshops/short courses – one per participating country per year – to build a 
community of practice; and 4) E -learning resources to catalyze the roll -out of bioinformatics education and 
support ongoing collaboration.  By the end of the project , over 100 bioinformatics trainers were trained and 
more than 800 scientist s attended one of the project’s bioinformatics workshops . Bioinformatics positions 
had increased by over 80 % amongst participating institutions, whereas the number of projects generated by 
partners rose by an average of 5 per year  compared to baseline ; internation al collaborations of partner 
institutions increased by almost 30% . The project generated 20 publicati ons and 95% of partners reported 
submitting all their data to publicly available databases. After the project ended, the community of practice 
continued and managed to generate a follow up project ‘CABANAnet’ . 
Bioinformatics courses from South Green platfo rm  
The South Green platform delivers a wide range of courses in genomic data analyses on an annual basis. 
These courses cover various topics such as transcriptomics, genome sequencing, scientific programming, and 
reproducible research. The platform is str ongly supported by French institution s IRD, CIRAD, INRAE, and the 
Alliance of Bioversity International  & CIAT . 
Most of these courses are conducted in Agropolis, Montpellier, France, where a rich pool of expertise is 
available. However, South Green has expa nded its reach beyond France and has successfully organized 
courses in other countries as well, including Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Vietnam. This global outreach has 
allowed the platform to engage with diverse scientific communities and foster collaborati on on an 
international scale. Over the past 10 years, South Green has organized more than 50 courses. These courses 
are designed to be hands -on and offer practical training experiences to participants.  
In addition to the courses, the platform also serves as a hub for hosting students and visiting scientists who 
wish to undertake longer training periods. This facilitates the exchange of knowledge and expertise between 
researchers from different background s. These individuals have the opportunity to engage in joint research 
activities, enabling them to collaborate on cutting -edge projects and contribute to the advancement of 
genomics research.

1. INTRODUCTION  
The Republic of Zambia Ministry of Green Economy and Environment has appointed Mamadi International 
Limited (hereafter referred to as Mamadi) to undertake the Development of a National Framework for 
Weather, Water and Climate Services (NFWWCS -ZM). The NFWWCS -ZM is an institutional tool that aims 
to enhance collaboration among national institutions. 99Its goal is to improve the co -production, tailoring, 
delivery, and utilization of science -based weather, water, and climate forecasts and services. This is achieve d 
through focusing on the five pillars of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS).  
The NFWCS was developed in cooperation with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to strengthen 
the production, availability, delivery, and application of science -based climate monitoring and prediction 
services. During the Sixteenth World Meteorolog ical Congress, Resolution 47 (Cg -16) mandated that WMO 
lead the development of the GFCS Implementation Plan with the active involvement of relevant stakeholders, 
including United Nations bodies. To produce and apply climate services, the GFCS addresses the  entire 
value chain. This Framework is designed to mainstream climate science into decision -making at all levels 
and ensure that every country and every climate -sensitive sector of society can access and use relevant 
climate information. Through the develo pment and incorporation of science -based weather and climate 
information and prediction services into planning, policy, and practice, the Framework seeks to enable better 
management of climate variability and change at all levels.  
The Government of Zambia strives to reduce the vulnerability of the country to climate change. The frequency 
and severity of floods and droughts are expected to increase in various parts of Zambia in the future. Small 
farmers in rural areas of Zambia are h ighly vulnerable due to their reliance on agriculture which is dependent 
on rainfall. To enhance Zambia's resilience to climate change, the Ministry of Green Economy and 
Environment through the Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD) is working in partnersh ip with the 
Accelerating the Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research in Africa (AICCRA) project to create a National 
Framework for Climate Services for Zambia. Through this joint initiative between ZMD and AICCRA, Mamadi 
is undertaking the Development of a Natio nal Framework for Weather, Water and Climate Services.  
It is against this background that the stakeholders’ consultative workshop was held to facilitate the 
development of the NFWWCS for Zambia with full participation of all identified stakeholders.  It brought 
together all identified key stakeholders to draw consensus on the urgent need for improved weather, water, 
and climate services in the country and to identify the gaps and key elements for development of a national 
strategic plan and costed action plan for implementation of the NFWCS, focusing on areas fo r joint action.  
The main aim of the workshop was to involve experts from the NMHS and relevant regional/global climate 
centres in the country, government departments, universities and research institutions, key decision -makers, 
partners, and practitioners. The workshop fa cilitated identification of appropriate mechanisms to improve and 
sustain the flow, co -production, and delivery of user -salient climate information for different users. 
Specifically, it will result in:

• Enhanced understanding of the needs for weather, water, and climate services in different user 
sectors;  
• Improved knowledge of the existing interface and communication mechanisms and 
recommendations for improvements where needed;  
• Clear understanding of capacity development needs to implement GFCS at the national level; and  
• Strategic guidance on the institutional arrangements, partnerships and processes required to 
operationalize the NFWCS at the national level.  
Mamadi’s consultants with assistance from ZMD provided secretariat services for the 3 - days workshop for 
the following key sectors:  
• Disaster management and risk reduction;  
• Health;  
• Water resource management;  
• Agriculture and food security;  
• Human settlements (rural, and urban);   
• Biodiversity; and  
• Energy, etc.;  
2. OPENING REMARKS  
The workshop was opened by Mr. Edson Nkonde – Director of the Zambia Meteorological Department, Dr. 
Inga Jacobs -Mata, AICCRA Zambia Lead . 
Dr. Ernest Afiesimama, representative of the World Meteorological Organization , and Mr. Mamadi Mabu - 
Lead Consultant and Chairman  of Mamadi and Company .  
The workshop was officially opened by the guest of honor Hon. Eng. Collins Nzovu, MP, the Minister of the 
Green Economy and Environment.  
During their opening remarks, the speakers pointed out key issues that are summarized as follows:  
• Closer coordination - The National Framework for Weather, Water and Climate services is necessary 
as it will develop an institutional mechanism to coordinate, facilitate and strengthen the collaboration 
among national institutions that will improve the co -production, tailoring, delivery and use of science -
based climate predictions and services for decision -making in climate -sensitive socio -economic 
sectors such as agriculture and food securi ty, water, energy, disaster risk reduction, health, aviation, 
among  others.

• Review current status of weather, water and climate services provided in the country and recommend 
further improvements.  
• The workshop has brought together different stakeholders with a role in weather, water and climate 
services’ value chain pointing to needs of closer coordination.  
• Hopeful that once developed, the framework will promote strong partnerships at national level that is 
needed for successful provision of climate services which inform climate -sensitive decision -making, 
and effectively contribute to sustainable development and resilience -building of communities and the 
country’s economy.  
• The role of the NFWWCS will be to strengthen and facilitate weather, water and climate services not 
to duplicate the already happening services.  
• Bring together all the available provisions and share resources towards the NFWWCS.  
• Government commitment critical to the establishment and operationalization of the NFWWCS  
• Strengthening the climate service capacities - The opportunity to evaluate the status of weather, 
water and climate services in Zambia and propose ways and means of improving the services.  
• There is need to build a climate sensitive society as climate change poses serious threats.  
• Timely and accurate information - People informed early and act early  
The progress in the implementation of a National Framework for Climate Services (NFWWCS -Zambia) was 
given by Mr. Mamadi Mabu who gave a background on the development of the GFCS and how it evolved 
from global to national level with the establishment of NFCSs that has been developed under the umbrella of 
the GFCS, established to harness both scientific and technologic al advances to enhance the development 
of tailored climate forecasts and predictions in support of climate risk management and adaptation plann ing 
to climate change decision -making, Went on to explain why Zambia needs the NFWWCS to improve the 
country’s preparedness and resilience to impacts of climate variabilities and change, outlined the process of 
developing it and where it is now.  
3. WORKSHOP  
The Ministry of Green Economy and Environment (MGEE) through the Zambia Meteorological Department 
(ZMD) hosted a three -day national Stakeholders’ Consultation Workshop at Urban Hotel in Lusaka, Zambia 
from 14 to 16 November 2023 to develop a National Framework for Weather, Water and Climate Services 
(NFWWCS) for Zambia. This workshop was held in accordance with the NFWWCS steps as provided by the 
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Step -By-Step Guidelines for National Framework for Weather, 
Water and Cl imate Services.  
Most identified key stakeholders drawn from government, and private organization as well as ZMD’s local 
and international partners attended the workshop. Seven national priority sectors were considered for the

workshop, six of them were represented and these were the Water, Agriculture and Food Security, Energy, 
Health, Human Settlement and Disaster Risk Reduction while there was no representative from Biodiversity.  
On day one of the workshop, selected institutions out of each sector were tasked to present an overview of 
the national sector -based climate -sensitive user landscape and share the impact of climate change on the 
sector. The presentations were divided into two sessions. Each session comprising of three sectors as 
follows:  
• Session One - Water, Agriculture and Food Security, and Energy  
• Session Two - Health, Human Settlement and Disaster Risk Reduction  
After each session’s presentations, followed a panel discussion that gave opportunity to sector panelist to 
hear inputs and answer questions from other participants. It allowed a very healthy participation from all the 
representatives that were present. In  line with the guest of honor’s words to the participants: “I encourage 
you to analyze all priority sectors and the climate challenges our country faces and ask as many questions 
as needed to address them” . The panel discussions that followed the section p resentations were so engaging 
and participants analyzed the information given and gave suggestions that were needed. The discussions 
further gave the participants an opportunity to share and compare notes within and across sectors.  
Day two started with the presentations of session two of the previous day thereafter, the participants were 
then set up in Breakaway Groups (BaGs) aimed at streamlining thematic climate change priority sector 
discussions and preparing inputs into the devel opment of the NFWWCS.  
Five Breakaway Groups (BaGs) were eventually formed in accordance with the priority climate change 
sectors participating in the workshop and Each BaG nominated one chair and one rapporteur. The human 
settlement sector, fell out due to lack of participants in the sector.  
The BaGs’ overall objective was to come up with the priority needs of the country in climate services to 
support effective climate risk management and adaptation. As a guideline, they were to identify climate 
change disasters that were experienced by the sector and how they were dealt w ith or managed. Secondly, 
come up with Weather, Water and Climate services that will be useful for managing climate risks and enabling 
better climate disaster preparedness and response and thirdly, the development of the sector action plan.  
3.1. SECTOR PRESENTATIONS  
Presentations were written by institutions that were earlier selected from each sector and presented by their 
representatives. They were to give an overview of the national sector -based climate -sensitive user landscape 
focusing on the impact of climate cha nge on the sector.  
3.1.1. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE WATER SECTOR  
Climate data requirements for water resources (Chizya Mvula - WARMA)  
The presentation highlights the four mandates of WARMA as to: regulate water utilization, water quality, 
water quantity; manage water planning, water assessment and flood forecasting; develop identification and

protection of potential freshwater sources and conserve, protect and preserve water dam s, wetlands, 
quarries, marshlands and head waters.  
It further gives the WARMA data stations covering the main water bodies in Zambia and the data products 
the institution produces. Then lists the sector’s requirements in terms of weather and climate data as well as 
capacity building.  
In conclusion, it states that:  
• Water resources monitoring is largely dependent on climate/weather data,  
• Improving the spatial and temporal resolution of climate products is critical to enhancing water 
resources information (water balance quantification & water allocation, flood forecasting & 
forecasting for future water availability/reservoir filling),  
• Enhancement of  Early Warning System  (EWS ) will lead to improvement in the accuracy of the issued 
alerts . 
3.1.2. THE IMPACT O F CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY SECTOR  
(Department of Agriculture)  
The Eighth National Development Plan (8NDP) 2022 – 2026 recognizes agriculture as one of the key sectors 
to achieving economic transformation and job creation in the Country. Most of the agriculture production in 
Zambia is by subsistence farmers (70%) who are dependent on rain fed agriculture.  The presentation points 
out that out of about 523,000 ha of land suitable for irrigation, currently about 200,000 ha of these (38%) are 
equipped for irrigation and under large scale farmers while the small scale farm ers remain at the mercy of 
climate variability and climate change.  
The presentation then focuses on the impacts of weather variability and climate change in Zambia that leads 
to: 
• Increased crop failure( Crop suitability shifting more and more to Agro ecological region III)  
• Reduced availability of irrigation water (underground and surface water)  
• Increased pests and disease outbreaks  
• Reduced pastures for livestock  
• Reduced production and productivity  
All put together puts of lot of stress and pressure on food security and the livelihoods of vulnerable 
communities.

3.1.3. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON T HE ENERGY SECTOR  
Overview of the energy sector in Zambia (Agnelli Kafuwe – Ministry of Energy)  
This presentation brought in another dimension of impacts of weather variability and climate change. With 
inter-seasonal rainfall variations, water for power generation reduced resulting in reduced power generation 
from the national hydropower stations. Po wer load -shading came in. The presentation demonstrates how 
reduced generation from hydropower stations triggered an increased consumption of charcoal and Liquified 
Petroleum Gas  resulting  with a reduction in household electricity demands.  It did not stop at households 
changing their types of energy use but further stimulated the government to revise energy Sector policies in 
2019.  
It concluded that the energy sector has not been spared from the adverse effects of climate change. 
Developing a diversified energy mix in the energy production portfolio will help reduce the dependence on 
hydro generation which is vulnerable to climate ch ange. It is imperative that climate change adaptation and 
mitigation measures are to be undertaken for a viable and sustainable energy sector.  
3.1.4. THE IMPACT O F CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE HEALTH SECTOR  
(Ngala Florence – Ministry of Health)  
The Health sector is vulnerable to climate change as the accompanying changes in climatic conditions affect  
human health directly or indirectly, leading to illness and death from extreme weather events, such as 
drought, storms, floods, temperature change , the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and 
food-, water - and vector -borne diseases.  
Zambia has a National Health Adaptation Plan (HNAP) which  is a health sector -oriented  climate change -
related  plan which addresses issues of the effects of climate change on human health, as a result of 
interactions of environmental, social and health system conditions. It is further a fulfillment of the obligations 
under the United Nations Framework Convention o n Climate Change (UNFCCC) and it’s inputs to the 
National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The overall objectives of the HNAP are to provide a broad framework for 
the health sector:  
• Mainstream climate adaptation in the health sector;  
• Strengthen the development and availability of evidence, building the data and reducing knowledge 
gaps, and inform relevant policies  
The health sector further highlighted its Climate change actions as follows:  
• Project on reducing UPOPs and mercury use in HFs. Introduced non -incineration methods - aimed 
at reducing carbon emissions  
• Conducted a Vulnerability Adaptation and Assessment (VAA) for climate sensitive diseases  
• Strengthened governance structures and promoting healthy cities concept

• Developed the Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP)  
The presentation listed the priority of its capacity building requirements as:  
• Logistics for the review of the National Health Adaptation plan  
• Development of Climate Change implementation guidelines  
• Development of Climate Change contingency plans  
• Training  at various levels in setting up early warning systems using climate change data  
• Training  in use of geographical data to map areas and predict  vulnerabilities to climate change  
In conclusion, climate variability and change is a major global health concern. Most of the outbreaks are easy 
to prevent, but the epidemic is becoming more out of control due to global warming and we need to take 
control of global warming not only for the  environment but for our lives.  
3.1.5. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON T HE HUMAN SETTLEMENT SECTOR  
(Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development)  
Human settlements are important because these are where the majority of the population live but some of 
them are in vulnerable places for example, areas prone to flash floods. The presentation labored to 
demonstrate how policies and regulations for human s ettlement in Zambia evolved with time to address 
challenges in the development of Human Settlements. In addition to other stresses on human settlements, 
climate change has not spared them, large and small, they are vulnerable to impacts that can be exacerb ated 
by direct climate changes (e.g., severe storms and associated riverine flooding) The following are highlighted 
as some of the impacts of climate variability and change:  
• Displacement due to flooding and droughts -some settlements are water -stressed  
• Increased intensity of winds thus blowing off roofs and destroying infrastructure  
• Failure in Agriculture leads  to increased rural -urban migration, further leading to unplanned 
settlements  
In terms of capacity building, the presentation goes for capacity building through their Local Authorities -City, 
Municipal , and Town Councils. They require Capacity Building skills to mainstream Climate Change data i n 
the Integrated Development  Plans  (IDPs).  
3.1.6. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON T HE DISASTER MANAGEMENT SECTOR  
Miyoba Musale (Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit)  
Zambia has experienced some climate variability and change -related  disaster effects  as a result of severe 
storms, floods, landslides, and prolonged dry spells. The presenter indicated that, DMMU projections shows  
Page 14:

14 
 
that as of September, 2023, approximately 1.5 million people representing 17% of the population were 
exposed to hydro -meteorological hazards.  
Further, a list of sectors that are affected by disasters was given as:  
• Health and Nutrition - The outbreak of communicable and non - communicable diseases is evident 
due to flooding and extreme temperatures. The health system is usually overwhelmed with increased 
disease.  
• Agriculture and food security - Most of the people in Zambia depend on rain -fed agriculture and 
flooding may wash away crops. Prolonged dry spells and delayed onset of the rainy  season usually 
cause  crop loss resulting in a decrease in production resulting in food insecurity.  
• Livestock and fisheries - The livestock and fisheries sector are equally impacted by outbreaks of 
diseases, displacement , and loss of livestock. The pasture for livestock in most cases equally 
diminishes  due to prolonged dry spells.  
• Human settlement and Shelter - The houses made of fragile materials (mud and poles ) are highly 
affected by floods due to compromised structural integrity.  
• Infrastructure - Extreme flooding usually affects  various critical infrastructures  such as health centers, 
schools, water points, sanitation facilities, roads, culverts , and dams. Some areas become 
inaccessible due to washed -away  bridges, culverts , and roads. Most of the infrastructure is not 
climate resilient, making it highly susceptible to extreme weather patterns.  
• Education - The education sector experiences increased absenteeism of school -going  children due 
to, among other reasons destruction of school infrastructure like blown -off roofs. Some schools may 
also become inaccessible during the rainy season because of surging rivers forcing learners to stay 
away from school. In cases where there is food insecurity, school -going  children , especially the girl 
child may be more vulnerable to the impacts of flooding.  
• Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) - Water sources such as boreholes and shallow wells as 
well as pit latrines are usually flooded. This usually results in outbreaks  of waterborne  diseases. Dam 
infrastructure for drinking water also collapses especially those that were built a long time ago. Most 
households in flood -prone  areas, usually have challenges accessing  clean water for domestic use.  
To improve community preparedness and resilience to climate variability and change disasters, the sector 
recommended the following capacity -building  programs:  
• There is a need for communities to be equipped with knowledge of early warning systems and how 
to operate them  
• Training programs on first aid and emergency response  
• Training of Satellite Disaster Management Committees (SDMCs) in weather analysis and 
interpretation

ZAMBIA  
  
 
15 
 
• Training in resilience -building  programs especially in agriculture and infrastructure, in communities 
which are disaster -prone . 
In its recommendations and conclusion, the presentation advocates for the inclusion of (i) disaster risk 
reduction as a core feature of sustainable development and adaptation to climate change in all sectors, and 
undertake awareness -raising to change public perceptions to see disasters as preventable; (ii) undertake 
awareness -raising in disaster risk reduction as an essential element of strategies and (iii) enhance early 
warning systems to inform the relevant authority and population on time for quick decis ion making.  
3.2. REPORTS FROM BREAKAWAY GROUPS (BAGS) 
Breakaway sector groups began meeting in the afternoon of day 2 and concluded in day 3. BaG lead ers were 
asked to give feedback  after every session for discussion with all participants. Below are the reports from the 
BaGs.  
3.2.1. WATER SECTOR BREAKAWAY GROUP  
The water sector breakaway group built their discussion on the happening of (e.g. 2018, 2021 , and 2022) 
recent years when severe storms resulted in flash floods that affected both rural and urban settlements , 
contamination of drinking water , and outbreak of water bone diseases. The sector is sensitive to climate 
variability and change with critical consequences to human society as a result of events such as droughts, 
floods and long -term water resources may end up in destruction  to ","8128"

Background  
FARA, as a continental organization, has been leading the strengthening of the Knowledge 
Ecosystem agenda for the African Agricultural Research and Innovation Institutions (FARA, AFAAS, 
CCARDESA, CORAF & ASARECA) over the past years. This aim is to build synergies, deliver on our 
mandates and sustain the gains made.  As part of this wider collaboration, DSpace was identified by 
the CAADP -XP4 Consortium members and experts as a very robust tool for the integration of Library 
resources within these institutio ns.  
Recognizing the leadership roles and experience that ILRI has taken convening and building the 
CGIAR-wide ‘CGSpace’ platform on DSpace, there is strong interest to convene an initial scoping and 
design exercise to share experiences and help formulate a ‘ro admap to DSpace’ and project for the 
CAADP -XP4 Consortium.  
Meeting objectives  
1. Expose CAADP -XP4 Consortium members to DSpace and the CGSpace collaboration, sharing 
practical insights and lessons as well as strategic choices and options that were followed.  
2. Develop a joint outline and ‘road map’ to establish a joint repository of CAADP -XP4 
Consortium information and knowledge products and assets.  
3. Agree collaboration priorities and modalities to link the new repository with CGSpace and 
draw in relevant CGIAR expertise via ILRI and partners. 
 
Meeting outputs  
The main product from the meeting was an outline for an ‘ Africa Agri-Knowledge explorer and 
repository ecosystem ’ that could serve the shared goals of the partners and advance the wider 
science, innovation and transformation agenda of the continent.  
Preamble 
Transforming and sustaining African food, land and water systems is a complex challenge. Knowledge is a critical enabling factor for healthy agri-food innovation systems, m aking science 
accessible to stakeholders, validity of different knowledge systems and f ostering collaboration. It 
requires different stakeholders working together using spaces for them to share their knowledge, 
expertise and experiences ; to facilitate this, knowledge management will be essential.  
 
Building on existing high -level collaborations such as  
• The High -Level Consultative Forum on Strengthening Africa's Agricultural Research and 
Innovation in the Context of the CGIAR Reforms”  
• Action Plan for the Operationalization of the Abidjan II Communique  
• The joint implementation of the CAADP -XP4 -CGIAR-AUC MOU on KM Partnership 
Framework  
 The joint KM Working group of the Africa Agricultural Research and Innovation Institutions (AARII) 
i.e FARA, AFAAS, ASARECA, CCARDESA, CORAF, NAASRO a s well as  RuFORUM and AATF and the 
CGIAR represented by ILRI, IITA and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT agree to 
Page 4:
collaborate to implement a shared, value -adding project to expose and highlight and communicate 
Africa’s rich  agricultur e and food system knowledge .  
 
This will be achieved through a shared knowledge ecosystem that facilitated inter -operability, is 
based around a DSpace repository that drives and powers diverse organizational knowledge hubs as 
well as a joint continental knowledge explorer that gives acc ess to the knowledge resources of the 
partners as well as, potentially, others.   
Project vision  
Make Africa Agricultural knowledge and Innovations available, accessible, inter -operable and usable 
through a sustainable knowledge ecosystem on inclusive and resilient Food Systems leading to a 
healthy and food secure continent . 
 
Project strategy  
Develop and implement a one-stop -shop  digital ‘explorer’ and repository  for continent -wide 
agricultural knowledge and innovations for Africa , based on shared:  
• Human resources  
• Technical expertise  
• Infrastructure  
• Financial resources  
• Opportunities of available Knowledge hubs  
• Lessons from CGSpace

A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Philippines Department of Agriculture, through the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice), and the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC), was signed on October 19, 2023, to collaborate on the development and testing of area-based yield index insurance (ARBY) for rice, based on satellite data. This collaboration aims to bring about institutional changes in delivering crop insurance, protecting 2.4 million farmers from climate risks such as tropical cyclones, droughts, and floods in the Philippines. The collaboration resulted from a series of discussions and engagements with PhilRice, operating under the Philippines Department of Agriculture, and PCIC on ClimBeR's de-risking activities, including the use of PRISM products, such as yield. This was followed by a feasibility assessment of an initial ARBY product developed for selected ClimBeR sites, and pilot sites were chosen to initiate the engagement.  ","366"

Farmers may fail to recognize the importance of these complements, leading to unsatisfactory crop yields and outputs and, eventually, dis-adoption of the variety. We provide a simple model of biased expectations, complementary input use and technology adoption and test its predictions using a field experiment among smallholder maize farmers in eastern Uganda. We find that pointing out the importance of complementary investments using a short, engaging video effectively deters some farmers from using commercial improved varieties. Consistent with the theoretical model, we find some evidence that this behavior change emanates from increased knowledge and expectations that are more in line with realized outcomes.

Taking maize seed embodying genetic gain as a case, we train random agro-dealers to test whether under-adoption by farmers is caused by low quality due to sellers' lack of knowledge about proper storage and handling. In a second hypothesis, we randomly introduce an information clearinghouse similar to popular crowd-sourced review platforms such as yelp.com or trustpilot.com to test whether information asymmetries crowd out quality seed. We find that the information clearinghouse treatment improves outcomes for both agro-dealers and farmers, with agro-dealers receiving more customers and reporting higher revenues from maize seed sales, and farmers reporting significantly higher use of improved maize seed varieties obtained from agro-dealers, leading to higher maize productivity after two seasons. The primary mechanisms behind this impact appear to be an increased effort to signal quality by agro-dealers and a general restoration of trust in the market for improved seed. The agro-dealer training does not have a clear impact on agro-dealers, nor on farmers in associated catchment areas. However, we do find that the information clearinghouse increases agro-dealer knowledge about proper seed storage and handling. Upon exploring interaction effects between the training and the clearinghouse treatment, we also find that the training becomes effective for agro-dealers that are also in the clearinghouse treatment group. This underscores the importance of incentives to make supply side interventions such as trainings effective. Author ORCID identifiers David J.

If well designed and implemented, the legal and regulatory framework can facilitate market diversification, supervision and quality control of seed and other forms of planting material, promotion of private sector participation, farmer access to improved seed varieties, reduced barriers for the movement of seeds across borders, and food security.
This study uses Regulatory Systems Maps (RSMs), a mapping tool for legal and regulatory processes and procedures, as a primary comparative method to assess the progress and dynamics in Uganda’s seed system along four key dimensions of the seed systems regulatory value chain: (i) early generation seed (EGS) production and distribution, (ii) varietal registration and release processes, (iii) seed quality assurance systems, and (iv) seed trade. The RSMs document and illustrate the processes and procedures contained in Uganda’s seed legal and regulatory systems, analytically isolating intervention points, proposed legal and regulatory changes, good practices and legal innovations, and systemic shifts over time, while also integrating important dimensions such as gender, inclusion, and flexibility that can address farmers’ needs, reduce costs, and increase participation in seed systems. The data and information used to compile the Uganda RSMs were developed and validated through a series of consultations with an array of stakeholders spanning both the public and private sectors.
The findings of the RSMs showed that, despite the comprehensive nature of Uganda’s seed rules and regulations and some notable innovations, implementation is a persistent challenge, and regulatory gaps and inconsistencies continue to exist. The RSMs indicate the need to take various measures to improve the enabling environment for seed trade in Uganda, including reviewing the current seed law, which is largely outdated; updating the existing seed regulations; adopting plant variety protection (PVP) regulations to implement the PVP Act; developing guidelines on agricultural research; and building capacity in both the public and private sectors.

However, previous research has indicated that female run business may be perceived less favorably compared to their male counterparts. In this paper, we examine potential consequences of these biased perceptions on business transactions. In particular, we test whether the gender of the seller has an impact on buyers’ negotiation strategies and eventual outcomes in bilateral price negotiations. We use a lab-in-the-field experiment in eastern Uganda, where a representative sample of smallholder maize farmers are offered the opportunity to bargain over a bag of improved maize seed variety from a male or female seller. We find that buyers confronted with a female seller are less likely to accept the initial offer price and respond with a lower counter-bid price than farmers faced with a male seller. Negotiations take an average of one round longer when the seller is a woman and the transaction price is almost 9 percent lower. For comparison, we also look at the effect of the starting price on the same bargaining outcomes and find that the gender disadvantage is roughly equal to a 20 percent higher starting price.

1 In tro duction
T o feed a gro wing p opulation in an en vironmen tally sustainable manner and in the midst of a long-
term climate crisis, farmers throughout the dev eloping w orld are exp ected to gro w more fo o d on less
land with greater e_x001E_ciency (Tilman et al., 2011; Garnett et al., 2013). T o ac hiev e this goal, m uc h is
exp ected from new tec hnologies, esp ecially from higher-yielding v arieties that are resilien t to p ests,
diseases, and other biotic stresses and are toleran t of drough ts, _x001D_o o ds, heat, and other abiotic stresses
(Ev enson and Gollin, 2003; Lybb ert and Sumner, 2012).
Unfortunately , the adoption of suc h tec hnologies is lagging in areas where they ma y ha v e the largest
impact. Recen t trends in agricultural pro ductivit y gro wth in Africa sho w that tec hnological progress
has largely stagnated on the con tinen t (Suri and Udry, 2022). Ho w ev er, signi_x001C_can t heterogeneit y
underlies this general stagnation. F or instance, at the micro lev el, w e often observ e dis-adoption
patterns and trends, where farmers c ho ose to switc h bac k to tec hnologies and inputs they ha v e b een
using for decades after trying out a new tec hnology once or t wice (Moser and Barrett, 2006; Chen,
Hu, and My ers, 2022). In man y cases, these patterns and trends cannot b e explained b y a lac k of
a w areness or information ab out, for example, impro v ed cultiv ars or inorganic fertilizers (Sheahan and
Barrett, 2017).1
There are man y reasons wh y farmers ma y not mo v e in to a state of sustained adoption of a giv en
tec hnology . An ob vious one is that farmers cannot access the tec hnology through lo cal mark ets or other
means of supply , or ma y ha v e enjo y ed access only for a limited time as part of a promotional campaign
or pro ject in terv en tion (Shifera w et al., 2015). Another reason ma y b e that farmers learn o v er time
that a particular tec hnology is not suitable for them or do es not meet their exp ectations (Custo dio
et al., 2016). Heterogeneit y in the qualit y of the tec hnology , coupled with the fact that it is often
di_x001E_cult to assess qualit y prior to purc hase or application, ma y also result in dis-adoption (Bold et al.,
2017; Miehe et al., 2023). F armers that face credit or liquidit y constrain ts, or additional uninsured
risk ma y also reconsider past adoption b eha vior and tend to w ards dis-adoption (Karlan et al., 2014 ).
In the longer run, general equilibrium e_x001B_ects that accrue as more farmers adopt a new tec hnology ,
thereb y increasing supply of the commo dit y and reducing output prices, ma y also lead farmers with
higher marginal costs to exit the mark et and dis-adopt (Co c hrane, 1958).
In this pap er, w e consider the p ossibilit y that farmers hold in_x001D_ated exp ectations of new tec hnologies
as an explanation for their dis-adoption. These in_x001D_ated exp ectations result from the p ossibilit y that
farmers ma y b e una w are (or fail to recognize) the need for substan tial complemen tary in v estmen t.
Indeed, for the new h ybrid seeds suitable for East African maize farmers that came on the mark et
a few decades ago, the promise to double or ev en triple yields could t ypically only b e ac hiev ed in
fa v orable climatic conditions and with the addition of fertilizer and other inputs (Quiñones, Borlaug,
and Do wsw ell, 1997). Chen, Hu, and My ers (2022) sho w that farming with impro v ed maize v arieties is
far more costly than farming with unimpro v ed maize v arieties. The additional pro duction costs include
not just the (higher) cost of seed but also higher fertilizer costs required to ac hiev e exp ected yield
impro v emen ts, as w ell as higher costs of lab or for farm tasks that are asso ciated with the cultiv ation
of higher-yielding maize.
In_x001D_ated exp ectations ab out tec hnology p erformance can ha v e lasting impacts on adoption if farm-
ers attribute p o or outcomes to the tec hnology , instead of to insu_x001E_cien t complemen tary inputs and
e_x001B_ort. This learning failure is often understandable: if m ultiple factors sim ultaneously a_x001B_ect yields
and outputs, then learning ab out the causal impact of a new tec hnology from a single exp erience is
di_x001E_cult, esp ecially if the tec hnology p erforms only under sp eci_x001C_c or sto c hastic circumstances suc h as
abiotic stress (Lybb ert and Bell, 2010), or if the farmer is unable to learn in a Ba y esian manner b e-

This pap er w as motiv ated b y evidence suggesting that man y farmers are una w are that agricultural
tec hnologies suc h as impro v ed v arieties require substan tial complemen tary inputs and e_x001B_orts to reap
b ene_x001C_ts. Indeed, it is theoretically p ossible and quite reasonable to b eliev e that farmers o v erestimate
the returns to a tec hnology and are disapp oin ted when they compare realized yields with what they
exp ected at the time of plan ting. Because it is hard for farmers to learn ab out the yield resp onse
of a single input, farmers ma y decide that the tec hnology itself is to blame. This is consisten t with
the observ ation that farmers think inputs are often coun terfeit or of lo w qualit y , ev en when ob jectiv e
assessmen ts of input qualit y _x001C_nd them to b e acceptable (Barriga and Fiala, 2020; Mic helson et al.,
2021).
Man y researc hers w orking in dev eloping-coun try agriculture will ha v e their o wn anecdotal evidence
of in_x001D_ated exp ectations that illustrate the presence of biased exp ectations, sub-optimal complemen tary
in v estmen ts, and subsequen t dis-adoption when disapp oin ting outcomes are attributed to the tec hnol-
ogy itself. F or instance, researc hers ma y b e familiar with farmers' b elief that using inorganic fertilizer
for one cropping cycle will lead to long-lasting soil fertilit y impro v emen ts. Others ma y b e familiar with
another common b elief among farmers_x0016_often promoted b y extension agen ts and agro-dealers_x0016_that
an impro v ed v ariet y is a _x0010_miracle seed_x0011_ that can b e plan ted without additional inputs or manage-

b een written on the singular p o w er of genetic impro v emen t, from the semi-dw arf _x0010_Green Rev olution_x0011_
v arieties of wheat and rice to genetically mo di_x001C_ed crops (Lipton and Longh urst, 1989; T ripp, 2002;
Sum b erg, Keeney , and Dempsey, 2012). An example the learning failure and its consequences w as
pro vided b y extension agen ts w e w ork ed with. Seed of impro v ed maize v arieties need a lot of n utrien ts,
often lea ving soil more depleted than when farmer-sa v ed seed is used. In the areas where our researc h
is situated, Striga ( Striga hermonthic a ), a parasitic w eed that feeds on the ro ots of maize plan ts and
cause stun ted gro wth, is a serious problem. Unfortunately , Striga proliferates in p o or soils and as
a result some farmers no w b eliev e that impro v ed seed v arieties are resp onsible for increased Striga
infestations on their _x001C_elds.
T o dev elop our theory of in_x001D_ated exp ectations, w e presen t a simple mo del of tec hnology adoption
that incorp orates the ideas discussed ab o v e. In this mo del, farmers compare the exp ected returns of an
impro v ed tec hnology to their business-as-usual c hoices. The new tec hnology comes at a cost, while the
unimpro v ed tec hnology do es not. Both tec hnologies, though, require complemen tary inputs and e_x001B_orts
that directly a_x001B_ect pro ductivit y , with pro ductivit y gains from the new tec hnology only materializing
when complemen tary inputs and practices exceed business-as-usual lev els for the unimpro v ed tec h-
nology . F urther, recognizing that farmers ma y b e heterogeneous, w e de_x001C_ne sev eral farmer t yp es and

These _x001C_ndings ha v e implications for our understanding of smallholder tec hnology adoption dynam-

v arieties b ecause they b eliev e in _x0010_miracle seeds_x0011_, their yields are lik ely to b e disapp oin ting. Often,
disapp oin tmen t ab out the p erformance of a tec hnology is then erroneously attributed to the tec hnol-
ogy itself, p oten tially leading to dis-adoption. _x0010_Correcting_x0011_ incorrect b eliefs ab out the needed inputs
and e_x001B_orts ma y result in farmers dis-adopting tec hnologies in the short run. Ho w ev er, if farmers'
exp ectations b ecome more realistic, the ones that k eep adopting (or start adopting in ligh t of the

whic h in turn could lead to e_x001E_ciency gains and p ositiv e spillo v er e_x001B_ects. Our _x001C_ndings also imply that
public and priv ate actors in the agriculture sector need to promote new tec hnologies as highly site- and

2 Related literature
Agricultural tec hnology adoption is at the heart of a ric h b o dy of researc h on fo o d securit y , p o v ert y
reduction, economic dev elopmen t, and structural transformation. Studies on the economics of tec hnical
c hange in agriculture go bac k to at least Grilic hes (1957) and are review ed in widely cited articles suc h
as F eder, Just, and Zilb erman ( 1985) and Sunding and Zilb erman (2001). More recen tly and with
the proliferation of _x001C_eld exp erimen ts and randomized con trolled trials, economic theories that explore
alternativ e driv ers of tec hnology adoption ha v e receiv ed greater empirical atten tion.
Most of these studies (implicitly) assume that some kind of graduation mo del underlies the tec hnical
c hange pro cess, wherein farmers switc h from a lo w-lev el equilibrium to a high-lev el equilibrium in
whic h tec hnology use is sustained once initial conditions_x0016_t ypically , access to information or _x001C_nance_x0016_
are satis_x001C_ed or binding constrain ts remo v ed (Karlan et al., 2014 ; Shifera w et al., 2015 ; Abate et al.,
2016 ). Y et most of these studies follo w farmers across a limited n um b er of agricultural seasons, and
are unable to fully appreciate the dynamics of tec hnology adoption o v er time. Only a few studies o_x001B_er
a long-term p ersp ectiv e, with sev eral do cumen ting signi_x001C_can t lev els of dis-adoption (e.g. Ainem babazi
and Mugisha, 2014 ), or transien t tec hnology use o v er time (Moser and Barrett, 2006 ; Chen, Hu, and
My ers, 2022 ).
A t the core of our theoretical framew ork describ ed in Section 3 is a mo del of learning failures where
farmers ha v e in_x001D_ated exp ectations ab out the returns to a new tec hnology , but fail to unco v er the true
form of the pro duction function through exp erience, leading to disapp oin tmen t and subsequen t dis-
adoption. Indeed, heterogeneit y in farmer c haracteristics implies that farmers need to learn whether
using a new tec hnology is optimal for their sp eci_x001C_c con text giv en costs and b ene_x001C_ts ( Suri , 2011 ).
F armers learn through a com bination of o wn exp eriences and observing others (F oster and Rosenzw eig,
3
Page 8:
1995 ; Conley and Udry, 2010 ). Ho w ev er, learning ab out a new tec hnology is often di_x001E_cult for reasons
related to the tec hnology's complexit y and the observ abilit y of its qualit y or p erformance (i.e., its
exp erience go o d nature) (Lybb ert and Bell, 2010 ; Bold et al., 2017 ; Ashour et al., 2019 ), or the so cial,
psyc hological, and b eha vioral attributes of the farmer and her learning pro cess (F oster and Rosenzw eig,
1995 ; Hanna, Mullainathan, and Sc h w artzstein, 2014 ).
One strand of the literature argues that sequen tial adoption leads to exp erien tial learning b y farm-
ers. In cases where tec hnologies are bundled in pac k ages, it is often observ ed that farmers sequen tially
adopt comp onen ts of the pac k age, rather than adopting the en tire pac k age at once (e.g., By erlee and
De P olanco, 1986 ). Leathers and Smale (1991) argue that this o ccurs when farmers emplo y a Ba y esian
approac h to learning in whic h they try to isolate the impact of one comp onen t of the pac k age at a
time. Ho w ev er, there are circumstances under whic h this strategy is not optimal b ecause it can prev en t
farmers from iden tifying p oten tial synergies b et w een tec hnologies, inputs, and practices. Indeed, the
reason wh y man y in terv en tions are presen ted as a pac k age is b ecause these in teraction e_x001B_ects are not
trivial. F or instance, Kabunga, Dub ois, and Qaim (2012) _x001C_nd that banana tissue culture, a tec hnology
to ensure that banana plan tlets are free from p ests and diseases, leads to a sev en p ercen t yield gain
in Ken y a. Ho w ev er, they also _x001C_nd that impro ving access to irrigation can lift yield gains ab o v e 20
p ercen t. If man y complemen tarities lik e this exist, it seems unlik ely that farmers are in a p osition to
follo w a sequen tial learning path that allo ws for all p ossible in teractions b et w een the di_x001B_eren t tec h-
nologies within a reasonable time frame. F urthermore, as men tioned ab o v e, farmers ma y face certain
b eha vioral constrain ts that inhibit their abilit y to learn ab out in teraction e_x001B_ects if, for example, they
pa y atten tion to minor or tangen tial attributes of the pac k age and miss the more imp ortan t attributes
(Hanna, Mullainathan, and Sc h w artzstein, 2014 ). Our study con tributes to this literature b y pro vid-
ing additional evidence on the limits of Ba y esian learning in the con text of agricultural tec hnology
adoption.
Another strand of the literature addresses the tec hnology learning pro cess in terms of ho w farmers
compare realized yields against exp ected yields to inform their subsequen t, longer-term adoption de-
cisions. The e_x001B_ect of incorrect exp ectations ab out future returns on decision-making has b een studied
most in the con text of education, but is readily applicable to learning in agriculture. F or example,
b oth Nguy en (2008) and Jensen ( 2010 ) _x001C_nd that pro viding accurate information ab out the returns to
education signi_x001C_can tly increases in v estmen t in sc ho oling (in Madagascar and the Dominican Republic
resp ectiv ely). V an Camp enhout ( 2021 ) _x001C_nds that a video in terv en tion that informs Ugandan farmers
ab out the returns on in tensi_x001C_cation in v estmen ts in rice gro wing impro v ed practices and increased input
use and pro duction. Note that across these studies, it is assumed that the individual underestimates
the returns in question. In our study , as a result of under-in v estmen t in complemen tary inputs, farmers
are in a sense o v erestimating returns to a new tec hnology , leading to o v er-in v estmen t in tec hnologies.
Finally , the in terv en tion w e use to test our h yp othesis builds on a strand of the literature that
fo cuses on the role of video-mediated messaging to con v ey salien t information to farmers. This lit-
erature explores the w a ys in whic h informational videos can c hange b eha vior in a v ariet y of settings
and through a range of mec hanisms. F errara, Chong, and Dury ea (2012) sho w ho w teleno v elas ha v e
an impact on fertilit y in Brazil. Riley (2022) _x001C_nds that in Uganda, studen ts that w atc hed a Disney
feel-go o d mo vie called _x0010_Queen of Kat w e_x0011_ ab out a c hess pro digy gro wing up in the slums of Kampala
do b etter on their exams, particularly in math. In the con text of agricultural tec hnology adoption,
V an Camp enhout, Spielman, and Lecoutere (2021) sho w that farmers that w ere exp osed to videos
similar to those w e use in the presen t study p erform signi_x001C_can tly b etter on a kno wledge test, and
are more lik ely to apply recommended practices and fertilizers than households that did not view the
video. These same households also rep ort maize yields 10.5 p ercen t higher than the con trol group.
In Ethiopia, Abate et al. (2023) assess the impacts of video-mediated agricultural extension service
pro vision on farmers' adoption of impro v ed agricultural tec hnologies and practices using data from
a t w o-y ear randomized exp erimen t. Our study uses a ligh t touc h in terv en tion where treatmen t and
con trol videos w ere v ery similar, exp ect for one small piece of information. Our study th us con tributes
to this literature b y testing if videos are also e_x001B_ectiv e in con v eying subtle messages.

3 Theoretical framew ork
In our theoretical framew ork, w e describ e farmers as solving an in tertemp oral problem in whic h they
allo cate resources at t in order to maximize pro_x001C_ts at t+1.4In line with Suri (2011), w e assume that
farmers (indexed i in the mo del b elo w) are risk-neutral and c ho ose to plan t seed whic h is either of a
V ariet y H, a new v ariet y that is sto c hastically dominan t in yield and other attributes in all states, or
of a V ariet y L, an old v ariet y that is sto c hastically inferior in yield and other attributes in all states,5
to maximize their pro_x001C_ts p er area of land. In doing so, they compare the exp ected pro_x001C_t functions of
V ariet y H π∗H
it and V ariet y L π∗L

F armers adopt the sto c hastically dominan t V ariet y H if they exp ect it to b e more pro_x001C_table than

Equation 3 sho ws that adoption decisions fundamen tally dep end on yield comparisons. W e assume

Yield for V ariet y H follo ws the same function, but adds a p ositiv e and constan t adoption premium

4F or simplicit y , w e assume a discoun t factor of 1, but another discoun t factor will not alter the results.
5The mo del is applicable to a v ariet y of cases as V ariet y H and V ariet y L can b e in terpreted as impro v ed and
unimpro v ed, farmer-sa v ed and commercially-purc hased, mo dern and traditional, new er and older, h ybrid and op en
p ollinated v arieties, etc.
6In a coun try lik e Uganda, where most grain is com bined, milled, and sold without v arietal denomination, this is a
reasonable assumption. In other coun tries suc h as Mala wi or Mexico, where consumers ha v e distinct v arietal preferences
related to taste, texture, and color, this assumption migh t not alw a ys hold.
7Seed of V ariet y L ma y not b e free but ha v e a shado w price of at least the grain price, whic h could b e subtracted
from the exp ected rev en ue in Equation 2 , so that the adoption decision in Equation 3 w ould not only dep end on yield
comparisons but also on cost comparisons. Suri ( 2011) tak es this in to accoun t but also notes that the cost of, in her case,
farmer-sa v ed seed is lik ely to b e lo w, if not zero. Rather than complicating the mo del b y explicitly mo deling the price
of the sto c hastically inferior v ariet y , w e decide to set it to zero. Setting it to a small p ositiv e v alue w ould not c hange the
predictions deriv ed from the mo del.
8F or simplicit y , w e assume that farmers ha v e only one plot and mo del the decision to adopt as a binary pro cess,
instead of expressing sit in kilograms of seed used. As suc h, bt refers to the cost of plan ting an en tire plot with seed of
V ariet y H.

If farmers are able to predict yields_x0016_at least on a v erage_x0016_in t+1, suc h that E(Yit+1) =Yit+1 +ε
andε∼N(0, σ ), their decision to adopt w ould dep end on the di_x001B_erence in yield b et w een V ariet y H
and L, on the relativ e prices of inputs, and on the yield resp onses to the inputs.
Next, w e in tro duce farmer heterogeneit y in to the mo del b y assuming that at least some farmers are
not a w are of the true relationship b et w een YH
it andXit , but instead b eliev e that the adoption premium
is alw a ys presen t, that is E_x0000_
YH
it+1_x0001_
=A+Yit_x0000_
XH
it_x0001_
. As a result, some farmer will use V ariet y H but
not enough complemen tary inputs, leading to disapp oin ting outcomes.
This v ariation in the mo del leads to di_x001B_eren t farmer-t yp es based on their dynamic pro_x001C_le and
kno wledge, as summarized in T able 1. Some farmers are kno wledgeable ab out the true relationship
b et w een YH
it andXit in Equation 5, and as a result mak e correct in v estmen t c hoices. F or at least
some of these farmers, referred to as T yp e 1 farmers in T able 1, the marginal cost of adoption will b e
lo w er than the exp ected marginal return in Equation 3, and as a result they adopt (and will con tin ue
to do so in the future unless there is a c hange in fundamen tals suc h as the cost of seed). F or another
subset of these farmers, referred to as T yp e 2 farmers in T able 1, the marginal cost of adoption will
b e higher than the exp ected marginal return, so they will not adopt (and are unlik ely to adopt in the
near future).
Another group of farmers is not kno wledgeable ab out the true relationship b et w een YH
it andXit
and b eliev es there is alw a ys an adoption premium. A subset of these farmers ma y adopt b ecause their
marginal cost of adoption is lo w er than their exp ected marginal return. W e refer to these farmers in
T able 1 as T yp e 3 farmers. Another subset of this group of farmers that is not kno wledgeable ab out
the true relationship b et w een YH
it andXit , referred to as T yp e 4 farmers in T able 1, do es not adopt at
baseline b ecause, ev en though they ha v e in_x001D_ated exp ectations of V ariet y H's yield, the marginal cost
of adoption still exceeds the exp ected marginal return.

This publication is part of a factsheet series reporting on the findings of the CGIAR FOCUS Climate Security Observatory work in Africa (Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Uganda, Zimbabwe). The research is centered around 5 questions: 1. How does climate exacerbate root causes of conflict? 2.

How does climate exacerbate root 
causes of conflict in  Ethiopia ?
Climate Security Pathway Analysis
PHOTO J. VAN DE GEVEL_BIOVERSITY INTERNATIONAL
This factsheet gives answers on how climate exacerbates root causes of conflict in Ethiopia, using a climate security 
pathway analysis. Two main pathways are identified: 
1. Livelihood and Food Insecurity: The majority of Ethiopia’s land is vulnerable to climate extremes, which affect 
the availability of food. Local hotspots of food insecurity in the Tigray, Somali and Afar regions correlate with a 
higher occurrence of conflict, making them prone to climate security risks. Vulnerability to climate and conflict 
also differs along gender and age lines, while pastoralist livelihoods are particularly affected by the compounded 
pressure of climate effects and political marginalization. Natural disasters and biophysical changes have led to 
the displacement of people, adding to the large number of internally displaced people due to conflict, which are 
leading to further tensions with host communities in the areas of refuge.
2. Resource Access and Availability: Climate variability and extreme events are putting pressure on Ethiopia’s 
natural resources of land and water. This is leading to an increase in conflict rooted in resource competition, 
particularly in border regions. These conflicts, particularly those around land, exacerbate ethnic violence between 
communities as they vie for territory and power within the context of ethnic federalism. Complicating matters 
further are conflicts arising between pastoralists and farmers over different land use options, including the 
transition towards large-scale farming and conservation programmes. These affect the availability and accessibility 
of pasture and water. Conflicts around water manifest at local, national and international levels. Such conflicts can 
concern issues related to access to water at boreholes, unequal distribution of water among industries and rural 
communities, as well as national water security among the riparian countries of the Nile River Basin.Niklas Sax, Gamal Mohamed Hassan, Abdimajid Nunow Abdi, Tanía Ferrè Garcia, Ignacio Madurga-Lopez,

Climate Security Observatory Series: Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIA1. CONTEXT
Climate Profile 
Ethiopia is characterised by its climatic and topographic heterogeneity. Conditions vary from semi-
arid desert in the northeast, east and southeast lowlands to high rainfall and high humidity in the 
south and southeast equatorial rainforests (UNFCCC 2015). The country has a significant degree of 
inter-annual variability, characterised by three rainy seasons: June to September (‘kiremt’), October to 
January (‘bega’) and February to May (‘belg’), the first accounting for 50 to 80 percent of total annual 
rainfall (UNFCCC 2015). Mean average temperatures range from above 25 °C in the lowlands to below 
15 °C in the highlands (UNFCCC 2015). Since 1960, average temperatures have risen by 1 °C, particularly 
from July to September, with a 20 percent increase in the number of hot days (WBG 2021). Similarly, 
there has been up to a 20 percent decrease in rainfall during the spring and summer seasons in areas 
situated in south and central Ethiopia between 1950 and 2010 (UNFCCC 2015). Due to highly variable 
precipitation patterns, there has also been a pronounced increase in heavy rainfall events (UNFCCC 
2015). Projected future trends indicate an increase in extreme climate events, such as droughts and 
floods (UNFCCC 2015). Recent floods in several regions of the country, particularly in Somali, affected 
240 000 people (ECHO 2023). Meanwhile, Ethiopia continues to suffer one of the most severe La 
Niña-induced droughts in recent decades, with four consecutive failed rain seasons since late 2020 
affecting more than 8 million people, mostly in the southern and southeastern parts of the country 
(OCHA 2022; IOM 2023).
Future projections of rainfall and temperature patterns in Ethiopia remain highly uncertain (FDRE 
2011). Climate models point to an increase in temperatures ranging between 1.5 °C and 3 °C by 2050 
(UNFCCC 2015). In the case of rainfall, there is greater uncertainty as to whether or not it will increase 
or decrease, as estimates range from increases of 30 percent to possible declines of up to 25 percent 
(FDRE 2011). Overall, rainfall projections indicate a reduction in rainfall (from minus 30 to minus 50 
mm) in eastern parts of the country from the southeast to northeast, with southern regions suffering 
the greatest declines, ranging from minus 50 to minus 100 mm (UNFCCC 2015). Reductions of more 
than 150 mm per year during the belg and kiremt rainfall seasons are expected to strongly impact 
the southern and western areas of the Somali and Oromia regions, characterised for being the most 
densely populated and largest crop growing areas in Ethiopia (UNFCCC 2015). 
Conflict and Fragility 
Never colonized and ruled by successive emperors until 1974, Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries 
in the world (UCDP 2022). Its political and conflict history and present realities are shaped by relations 
between its heterogeneous ethnic groups, as well as challenges imposed by the complex interplay 
of climatological and topographic conditions. Long droughts induced by El Niño events, like those in 
1972-73 and 1982-83, have led to famines that contributed to ethnic rebellions, political turmoil and 
radical changes of government (Comenetz and Caviedes 2002). Consecutive droughts in the mid-
1974s triggered social unrest that was used by the pro-Soviet Marxist-Leninist military junta known 
as the ‘derg’, to overthrow the regime of emperor Haile Selassie (Comenetz and Caviedes 2002; UCDP 
2022). The even more devastating famine of 1984-85 stemmed from a combination of drought and 
military counterinsurgency that denied food aid to Tigray and used food as a major element of a 
strategy to combat secession movements, with devastating effects on the population (de Waal 2018).

Climate Security Observatory Series : Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIAThe derg’s mismanagement of the 1984-85 famine and loss of international credibility due to their 
mishandling of relief aid contributed to their fall in 1991 (Fullerton Joireman 1997; ICG 2009).
Ethiopia’s diverse population comprises more than 70 ethnolinguistic groups, many of whom have a 
long history of separatist sentiment and interethnic conflict (UCDP 2022). The unitary  imperial state 
(1930 to 1974) and the Marxist derg regime (1974 to 1991) both aimed to maintain ethnic cohesion 
by promoting nation-building with the arms of the state (Yusuf 2019). Numerous opposition groups 
– including the Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF), Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), Eritrean 
People’s Liberation Front (EPLF), and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) – joined forces to 
coordinate military efforts and organise offensives to overthrow the derg regime (Fullerton Joireman 
1997). From 1976 to 1991, Ethiopia was in an intra-state conflict on various fronts. Tensions with Somalia 
over ideas of a “Greater Somalia”, as well as marginalization of the Somali region within Ethiopia, led 
to the Ogaden War in 1977-78, which Ethiopia won with the help of the Soviet Union, but grievances 
of Somali-speaking peoples in Ethiopia remain (Nkaisserry 1997). Eritrea’s long war for independence, 
fought since 1961 to break out of the then Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea under the Ethiopian 
crown, finally saw victory in 1991 when the EPLF defeated the Soviet-backed Ethiopian army and took 
control of Eritrea´s capital Asmara, paving the way for an independent Eritrea (Lyons 2018). The fall of 
the derg regime in 1991 culminated in the rule of the Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic 
Front (EPRDF), a broad political movement dominated by the TPLF and characterised by ethnic-based 
opposition parties and a decentralised constitution with a commitment to federalism (ICG 2009; 
UCDP 2022). Among Ethiopians there remains no consensus concerning the effectiveness of ethnic 
federalism, particularly because under TPLF rule it had been grafted onto a history of centralised 
statecraft that worked to undermine disparate elements of self-rule within the federation (Yusuf 2019; 
ICG 2019). A major conflict faultline remains within Ethiopian politics and society, revolving around 
the level of autonomy given to ethnic groups, which needs to find a balance between opposing 
sentiments of Ethiopian nationalism and ethnic nationalism (Yusuf 2019).
From mid-2010, competing ethno-nationalism led to a weakening of party and state structures, 
leading to intensified ethnic mobilisation (Yusuf 2019). After four years of street protests, and following 
the resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn, the EPRDF elected Abiy Ahmed Ali as prime minister, (ICG 
2019; UCDP 2022). The new political dispensation under Ahmed Ali came at the cost of bringing 
long-simmering conflicts, which had been under the tight 27-year grip of the EPRDF, to the surface 
(Yusuf 2019). Inter-communal violence significantly increased from November 2020 due to a dispute 
between the federal and TPLF leadership, which escalated into civil war, mainly concentrated in the 
northern Tigray region (ICG 2022a). In November 2022, following peace negotiations sponsored by the 
African Union, both parties signed the Pretoria Deal, initiating a reconciliation process focused on the 
facilitation of humanitarian aid delivery and protection of civilians (ICG 2022b; UNICEF 2022).
 
Socio-Economic Profile
Situated in East Africa, Ethiopia is sub-Saharan Africa’s second-most populous state (UNFCCC 2015). 
Production in the primary sector of agriculture is key to Ethiopia’s economy, contributing around 44 
percent of the national GDP, 73 percent of employment and 90 percent of total export earnings, linked 
to the commercialization of livestock products: skins and hides, coffee as well as pulses and seeds 
(CIAT and BFS/USAID 2017; CGIAR 2018). Agriculture is the sector most vulnerable to the impacts of 
Page 5:

Climate Security Observatory Series: Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIAclimate change, as it is predominantly dominated by small-scale subsistence farmers dependent on 
rain and traditional technology (CIAT & BFS/USAID 2017; CGIAR 2018; WBG 2011). The negative effects 
of climate change on the national economy are expected to reduce GDP by up to 10 percent by 2045 
(UNFCCC 2015). Likewise, Ethiopian agriculture is predicted to decline by 6 to 32.5 percent between 
2030 to 2050, making the country more dependent on food aid (Belay et al. 2021). Combined with 
declining soil fertility and lack of financial resources to adopt technologies, increased pressure over 
natural resources, mainly driven by a growing population and food demand trend, is one of the biggest 
challenges faced by the agricultural sector (CIAT & BFS/USAID 2018). Further compounding the 
challenges faced by the country, population growth has exacerbated Ethiopia’s land tenure system, 
characterised by state ownership of land, leading to increased insecurity of tenure and fragmentation 
of landholdings (FAO 2021a).  
While unemployment rates remain low (3.4 percent) and food consumption has improved in recent 
decades, poverty and food insecurity remain a problem in the lowlands,  as well as in the pastoral 
and drought-prone highlands (FAO 2021a; WB 2021). Recent survey data indicates that 68.7 percent 
of the total population in Ethiopia is multidimensionally poor (UNDP 2022). The prevalence of food 
insecurity across the country remains high and figures indicate one in every three children under 
five years old is undernourished and, even in wetter, more favourable times, up to 10 per cent of 
households still experience food insecurity and rely partly on food aid (FAO 2021b; FAO 2016; ODI 
2015). Access to food remains limited, with figures indicating 48 percent of household budgets are 
spent on food and only 14 percent of roads are paved (CIAT & BFS/USAID 2017). In 2022, prolonged 
drought, together with conflict and cholera outbreaks, severely undermined household food security, 
leading to a deteriorating humanitarian situation with 29.7 million people in need of assistance and 
4.51 million people internally displaced (UNICEF 2022).  
2. CLIMATE SECURITY PATHWAYS 
Ethiopia is ranked 161 out of 182 nations by the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) 
Climate Vulnerability Index for 2022, indicating current vulnerability to climate disruptions. Climate 
variability and extreme events are exacerbating inter-communal competition over natural resources 
and are having detrimental effects on rural livelihoods, which both contribute towards violent conflict 
in the country. The connection between climate and conflict are being identified through the I) 
Livelihood and Food Insecurity Pathway, and the II) Resource Access and Availability Pathway.
The identified pathways represent logical mechanisms of how the climate-security nexus may 
operate in Ethiopia, based on an approach combining: I) systematized search and interpretation of 
existing understanding in academic and grey literature; II) verification of identified linkages and key 
points of discussion emerging from the “IGAD–CGIAR: Climate Vulnerability and Impact Pathway 
Analysis Workshop” with participation by several governmental and non-governmental stakeholders 
from Ethiopia (March 2023, online).

affected by the compounded pressure of climate effects and political marginalization. Natural 
disasters and biophysical changes have led to the displacement of people, adding to the large 
number of internally displaced people due to conflict, which are leading to further tensions with 
host communities in the areas of refuge.PATHWAY #1: Livelihood and Food Insecurity
Agriculture constitutes a crucial role in Ethiopia, with around 85 percent of the population living in 
agrarian areas relying on agricultural production to sustain their livelihood (Zewudie et al. 2021). The 
major crops grown in the country are teff (22.9 percent of crop area / 16.8 percent of grain production), 
maize (16.9 percent / 26.8 percent), sorghum (14.8 percent / 16.2 percent), wheat (13.3 percent / 15.8 
percent ) and barley, which together form the core of Ethiopia´s agriculture and food economy, 
accounting for around three-fourths of the total cultivated area (Evangelista et al. 2013; Taffesse et 
al. 2011; Yang et al. 2020). Even though most arable land is already used for agriculture and Ethiopia 
being one of the largest cereal producers in Africa, it is not self-sufficient and needs to fill the large 
gap remaining between crop production and domestic demand with high investments in food 
imports (Zewudie et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2020). Given Ethiopia´s diverse geographic, topographic and 
climatologic conditions, climate variability has different agricultural impact in different regions. As 
a general contrast, in water-abundant western Ethiopia crop yields are positively correlated with 
solar radiation and maximum temperature, while yields are negatively correlated with these factors 
in water-scarce eastern and southeastern Ethiopia, with the correlation between crop yields and 
precipitation showing the opposite pattern (Yang et al. 2020). Ethiopia is extremely exposed to the 
impacts of climate change and variability, with close to 90 percent of its surface area is vulnerable 
to severe or extreme climate stress and nearly all of the country’s agriculture dependent on rainfall 
(Pacillo et al. 2021; Evangelist et al. 2013). Effects of climate impact on agricultural production within 
the three rain seasons are diverse and pose several further implications.
The most prevalent drying trends can be witnessed in the belg season, due to a reduction in rainfall 
and temperature-induced soil drying (Temam et al. 2019). Agriculturally the belg season is important 
to grow the staple crop teff as well as for long-cycle crops such as corn and sorghum, with drought 
in this season having profound implications for food security (Temam et al. 2019). Aside from drought 
induced by a lack of rain, Ethiopia also experiences what is known as ‘green famines’, which describes 
unfavourable seasonal shifts in rainfall patterns leading to crop failure due to disruptions in the critical 
germination periods (Evangelist et al. 2013). Teff is strongly affected by climate change, with future 
distribution changes and yield reductions leading to an average loss of about 24 percent of the 
current suitable cropping area by 2050 (Kiambi and Yao 2014). Given the estimation that ‘enjera’, a food 
staple made from teff, provides up to two-thirds of food consumed in Ethiopia, this has considerable 
implications for food security (Zewudie et al. 2021). The already huge deficit between teff production 
and national demand are further exacerbated by the effects of climate change and population growth, 
leading to increases in the price of Ethiopia´s staple food (Zewudie et al. 2021). 
Page 7:

Climate Security Observatory Series: Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIAThe main rain season, kiremt, which is dependent on location of the intertropical convergence zone 
(ITCZ), is important for the main season ‘meher’ cultivation period, when most crops are grown (Temam 
et al. 2019). Here also, worrying trends both from rainfall declines as well as seasonal warming, are 
found in most parts of the country and pose a threat to the production of cereal crops such as barley, 
teff and wheat (Temam et al. 2019). Particularly during El Niño years, summer rainfall in some parts of 
the country is low, which has often led to food security crises (Lewis 2017). Extreme drought conditions, 
like that in 2015 during an El Niño event, affect the crop health of barley, corns, millet, sorghum and 
wheat (Qu and Hao 2018). The reduction in crop production caused by these  extreme events amplifies 
existing stress on food insecurity and imposes significant demographic, social, economic, physical 
and psychological challenges on households that rely on agriculture for their livelihood (Gebre and 
Rahout 2021). Erratic crop production caused by unpredictable and unfavourable rainfall and other 
shocks is combined with the steady growth of human population and an increasing demand for food 
(Mekuria et al. 2018). Different exposure to drought between regions of Ethiopia suggests that the 
availability of food is not the only factor for food insecurity, as drought incidents are, in many cases, 
local (most often reported in Tigray, Afar and Somali), while national cereal production during the 
same years has been stable, suggesting challenges in the distribution of food (Lewis 2017). 
Effects on cash crops, such as coffee, further impacts the economic livelihood of farmers as well as 
the national economy in general. Coffee contributes to around one-quarter of Ethiopia’s total export 
earnings and its cultivation provides a livelihood income for around 16 percent of the population (SCIP 
2017). Rapidly increasing temperatures in Ethiopia are destroying coffee plants at an alarming rate 
and land suitable for the prominent Arabica coffee is projected to reduce by 65 percent due to climate 
change (Iscaro 2014). Some of the current growing areas are already poorly suited for the cultivation of 
coffee and are markedly impacted by climate change. However, substantial areas that were previously 
unsuitable will become suitable under current climate projections, which would make assisted 
migration to new areas a key component for ensuring the resilience of Ethiopia’s coffee economy, 
as existing adaptation options for smallholder coffee farmers are overburdened (SCIP 2017; Eshetu 
et al. 2021). As coffee production is decreasing, many farmers are choosing to grow ‘khat’ (a mildly 
psychoactive leafy shrub) as a cash crop to generate income (IGAD-CGIAR 2023). 
The bega season, while having the lowest amount of rainfall compared to the other two seasons, is 
crucial for on-farm soil moisture as well as for maintaining grasses in rangelands (Temam et al.  2019). 
Projected drought intensification rates of 10 percent per decade will have devastating impacts on 
both farmers and pastoralists (Temam et al. 2019). With more than 80 million head, Ethiopia has the 
largest livestock population in Africa (Gashaw et al. 2014). Changes in temperature and patterns of 
rainfall indirectly affect livestock through factors such as feed availability, grazing ranges, feed quality 
as well as directly due to heat stress and disease incidents (Gashaw et al. 2014). Rhodes and buffel 
grasses remain the most suitable species for forage grass production under future climate scenarios, 
but Ethiopia has a negative feed balance and cannot meet future feed demand as land availability 
for natural pasture has been substantially decreased in favour of agricultural land (Brychkova et al. 
2022). Most livestock production is already located in marginal lowland ecosystems, where climate-
induced disasters, such as increasingly recurrent drought, floods, erratic rainfall patterns and high 
temperatures add significant stress on viable grazing areas, making pastoral communities highly

Climate Security Observatory Series : Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIA“vulnerable to these disaster risks (Gashaw et al. 2014). Decision-makers are sometimes unaware of the 
specific challenges faced by pastoralists in Ethiopia in achieving and maintaining their livelihood, due 
to there being only a few mechanisms for local communities to transmit their knowledge (Chinasho 
et al. 2017). Pastoral systems have over centuries gone through cycles of coping and adaptation 
to extreme weather condition in semi-arid lands but the fragility of their systems becomes more 
apparent in severe droughts when crop failure and massive livestock death lead to famine, such as in 
the early 1970s and 1980s (Gebeyehu et al. 2021). 
“Climate change is affecting each and every sector, especially the livelihood sector with food 
security, but also education, health and everything fundamental to human wellbeing. Most of 
our people are living in rural areas, and the current drought is affecting people, livestock and 
nearly all regions. Many have lost their livelihood and are moving to IDP camps or towns.”
(IGAD-CGIAR Workshop participant 2023)
Livelihoods are threatened by major droughts and floods that reduce agricultural productivity, 
decrease food availability and increase food prices (Milman and Arsano 2013). The impact of climate 
change on rural livelihoods becomes visible through a decline in crop yield, diminishing livestock 
productivity, livestock and human disease outbreaks, reduction in water availability and conflict over 
resource competition (Mihiretu et al. 2021). In addition to the impact of climate variability on food 
security, droughts and floods disrupt transportation and other infrastructure, leading to a loss of 
household assets and negatively affecting the Ethiopian economy (Milman and Arsano 2013). Drought 
frequency is coupled with other environmental challenges, such as land degradation, deforestation 
and loss of biodiversity (Mekonen and Berlie 2021). Household vulnerability is increased due to low 
education level, limited infrastructure and lack of access to the enablers of adaptive capacity, such 
as information, technology or economic resources (Mihiretu et al. 2021; Mekonen and Berlie 2021). 
Land in Ethiopia is allocated by the state to farmers but as almost all land is occupied, scarcity of 
arable farmland and landlessness are increasing, particularly in the highlands (Yigezu Wendimu 
2021). The fragmentation of small farmlands through inheritance by children further increases 
household poverty, leading to greater food insecurity and vulnerability, particularly of youth who have 
to rely on decreasing land quantity and quality (Yigezu Wendimu 2021). Ethiopia has made strong 
commitments to strengthen its social protection system and support to food insecure households 
through: 1) boosting agricultural productivity; 2) assisted resettlement on voluntary basis; 3) income 
diversification; and 4) employment creation offering credit access to poor households. However, the 
programme faces significant challenges in implementation (Lemma and Cochrane 2019). Climate 
change and variability compounds these existing socioeconomic risks connected to food security, 
which generates insecurities over multiple dimensions of poverty, inequality, agricultural productivity, 
conflict and crisis exposure (Pacillo et al. 2021). 
In the local hotspots of Tigray, Afar and Somali, the persistent dry climate conditions co-occur with 
moderate to severe conflicts and different socioeconomic vulnerabilities, making them the regions 
most exposed to climate security risks (Pacillo et al. 2021). Discontent with food prices, exacerbated 
by insufficient rainfall, encourage citizens to challenge authorities through protest, particularly in 
already historically marginalized communities in the regions of Oromia, Somali and Afar (Yishak 2019). 
The governmental agenda to shift the economy away from an agricultural to a manufacturing base 
Page 9:

Climate Security Observatory Series: Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIAhas gained little traction for most of the rural population and grievances have arisen against foreign 
investors and state-led projects that did not generate enough jobs (ICG 2019). The widespread poverty 
of the unskilled labour force who did not profit from Ethiopia´s impressive growth in GDP contributed 
to the buildup of protests in 2015 that led to further inter-communal violence in the following years 
(Yusuf 2019). Pastoralists are among the most affected by climate impacts, and are also one of the 
most disadvantaged groups regarding the provision of formal education. This significantly limits their 
participation in the labour market and lowers the opportunity to transition their livelihood (Debebe 
2016). Efforts to mobilize ethnic groups to protest and take part in violent confrontations in various 
parts of the country gained resonance among angry youth who are lacking opportunities in a still 
largely agriculture-dominated economy, which is heavily impacted by climate change (Yusuf 2019).
Livelihood and Gender
The impact of both climate change and conflict is not equally distributed across society and differs 
according to gender and age, among other factors. Ethiopia has a patriarchal society with gender 
norms biased in favour of men, though variations exist between different ethnicities (Mersha and 
Van Laerhoven 2016). Being two-thirds poorer, less educated, and mostly not involved in political and 
household decision-making, women are inevitably more vulnerable to climate impacts (Herman 
2016). Women are also more likely to be killed by climate-related hazards and experience hunger 
after such events, which is partly because they are culturally expected to eat only after they have 
fed their families (Devonald et al. 2022; Herman 2016). Furthermore, during times of drought, when 
mobility increases, gender-based violence increases (IGAD-CGIAR 2023). It has also been found that 
the barriers to adaptation in Ethiopia are much higher for women engaged in agriculture (Mersha and 
Laerhoven 2016). 
Restrictive norms against women ploughing leads to their de facto exclusion from reciprocal 
labour support systems. The reliance on sharecropping arrangements makes on-farm adaptations 
almost unattainable for female-headed households given their low bargaining power (Mersha and 
Laerhoven 2016). Conflict further affects women disproportionately, with an increased risk of violence 
during climate-related conflict and displacement and being highly insecure while collecting water or 
firewood (Devonald et al. 2022). Adolescents and youth are also highly vulnerable to climate impacts 
as climate-related hazards disrupt services needed for their long-term development and education 
(Devonald et al. 2022). Droughts can triple the time needed for the collection of water, and as fetching 
water is predominately a task of girls this can affect their ability to remain in school (Gemechu 2022). 
Youth are often also unable to voice their concerns and ideas in community discourses due to age

Livelihood and Mobility
Ethiopia’s population can be divided into the central highlands, where the majority live; the relatively 
unpopulated and arid south; and the northern and central areas with moderate population density 
(Comenetz and Caviedes 2002). Long droughts, especially those associated with El Niño events, have 
historically contributed profoundly to the distribution of Ethiopia’s population, both through voluntary 
migration and government responses to emerging famine-induced political crises. A notorious 
example of latter came in 1978 in the form of relocations to poorly planned and hastily implemented 
agricultural villages, which later became known as the first process of villagization (Comenetz and

 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
Following the launch of the “Building Systemic Resilience Against Climate Variability and 
Extremes (ClimBeR )” Project in Zambia, last year (2022) in August, whose implementation is 
being coordinated by the Agricultural Consultative Forum (ACF), a multi -stakeholder technical 
Working Group has been constituted. The Working Group is expected to provide advocacy 
support to the ClimBeR Project by leading advocacy efforts to promote the integrated Future 
Estimator for Emissions and Diets (iFEED) to national policy audiences and development 
partners, under Work Package 3 (WP 3) of the Project. To kick start the work of  the ClimBeR  
Working Group,  ACF in partnership with the University of Leeds  held an inception workshop, in 
Lusaka, on Tuesday, 7th March 2023.  
The Workshop was aimed at introducing iFEED, as an integrated assessment framework that can 
explore the risks an d opportunities associated with agricultural policy decisions, through 
modeling of policy -relevant future scenarios of various policy priorities, such as what crop and 
livestock diversification, irrigation and land use changes would imply for Zambia’s futu re 
agricultural productivity, production, and food and nutrition security. The Workshop also aimed 
at soliciting contributions and reflections from the Working Group, on iFEED and how the 
Working Group will be operating, including the interpretation and us e of iFEED outputs or 
results to inform policy development.  
A total of 20 stakeholders attended the meeting drawn from members of the iFEED ClimBeR 
Project’s Working Group WP3, FoSTA -Health, FSNet and other stakeholders.  
 
2. PRESENTATIONS  
 
2.1 iFEED and ClimBeR  
Introductory presentations of iFEED and ClimBeR  were made by Dr. Rebecca Sarku and Dr. 
Stewart Jennings from the University of Leeds. In their presentation, the emphasis was on how 
iFEED can be used as a tool for building pathways towards a climate -resilient, nutrition -secure 
future in Zambia. Another talking point was on how Zambia ’s previous AFRICAP results can be 
explored  and utilized. Last but not least, the meeting was informed on how the ClimBeR project 
work can be explored and utilized to bui ld pathways towards a climate -resilient, nutrition -
secure future in Zambia. The presentation also gave the objectives of the workshop as well as 
some timelines events for the project.   
2.2 Food System Transformations in Southern Africa for One Health  and Linkage with ClimBeR  
Dr. Russell Cain from the University of Leeds gave a brief presentation on FoSTA -Health and the 
linkages with ClimBeR. The meeting was informed that ClimBeR focuses on the current weather 
Page 4:

 extremes and how they affect food security  while FoSTA focuses on food systems 
transformation. Further, the meeting was informed that iFEED is a tool that can be used to 
inform policy decisions in order to respond to the climate risks and ensure food systems 
transformation.  
2.3 Summary of Previou s Policy Engagements  using iFEED Evidence  
Dr. Frank Kayula the previous AFRICAP -iFEED Champion in Zambia gave some highlights of how 
iFEED evidence was used to engage with policy makers. In his presentation , he informed the 
participants that with the iFEED evidence, he engaged policy makers at a high level such as 
ministers and permanent secretaries in the relevant ministries  on the implications of the iFEED 
results . Following those engagements, there have been some short -term to long -term changes 
that have been realized in the agricultural sector. One example is th e removal of trade 
restrictions on regional agricultural trade. He also made mention of how iFEED can be used as a 
strong supporting case for resource mobilization to transform the agricultur al sector.  
2.4 Key Questions, Comments and Observations from the Presentations  
The following were some of the questions, comments and observations that stakeholders made 
after the various presentations:  
a) What key policy changes or transformations resulted  from the policy engagements using 
iFEED evidence?  
 There is currently an on -going process of transforming the agricultural sector through 
the Comprehensive Agricultural Transformation Support Programme.  
 New ministries have been created to respond to climate risks such as the Ministry of 
Green Economy and Environment.  
 There is an open -door policy in agricultural trade (border s remain open for trade with 
other countries).  
 The national budget now reflects i nvestment s in irrigation.  
 Organic fertilizer is being considered to reduce use of synthetic fer tilizer.  
 There has been an appreciation by stakeholders including government on the use of 
empirical evidence to inform policy  
b) There is need to conduct some re search on the residual effects of using selective and 
none selective herbicides and weed killers  on the safety of livestock and crops .

 3. BREAKOUT GROUPS:  USING IFEED EVIDENCE TO CREATE IMPLICATION STATEMENTS FOR 
ADDING EVIDENCE -BASED INFORMATION TO POL ICIES  
 
The objectives of the breakout session were to:  
a) Agree on policies that we will focus on using iFEED evidence to influence.  
b) Agreement on content of the iFEED evidence that the Working Group will co -
create with WP3.  
c) Agree on next steps / work timeline.  
The following is a summary of the policy and implication statement outcomes from the Working 
Group meeting. This is based on each of the three sub -groups used in the breakout: irrigation, 
diversification, livestock and land use change.

Modeling  info required:  
Mapping of climate impacts on crops and mapping of where both crops and livestock pasture 
expanding. Present information using agro -ecological regions.  
 
Potential implication statements:  
a) Where should we expand agricultural lan d? Specifically,  farm blocks are the likely/better 
areas or one of the areas where agricultural land should be expanded, as identified in 
policies. Does evidence suggest this is a good idea? Could also overlay current protected 
areas / forests / urban with  where land is said to expand?  
 
b) Livestock expansion - agro eco regions I and II - historically. Does future expansion into 
agro -eco region 3 make sense? There are cultural dietary issues as to why it hasn't 
expanded in region III previously.

 Potential implication statements:  
The following are some of the potential implication statements arising from the group 
discussions.  
 Assessment of the challenges and need to expand in each a gro-ecological region. This 
could include  where irrigation is most water efficient? (e.g. water that is used for 
multiple purposes), and where is irrigation most energy efficient? (e.g. pumping water). 
Combine modelling  information (demand) with this qualitative assessment of water 
supply / availability for assessment of where irrigation is most needed and where it 
realistically could increase.  
There was overlap in the policies identified in each of the three groups. The se two policies were 
identified in the top four of all three groups:  
 Second National Agriculture Policy - could input in the implementation plan (under review)  
 National policy on CC (2016) - could input in the implementation plan (under development)  
 
4. NE XT STEPS AND CLOSING REMARKS  
 
There will therefore be a need to coordinate activities when planning how we contribute evidence to 
policies.  
- Agree date for April meeting between WP3 team and each sub -group . This meeting will present 
the latest modelling  results, finalise the implication statement questions, finalise the policies we 
are targeting within each sub -group, and continue discussing how to go use evidence to inform 
these policies.  
- Before April meeting: each sub -group to check that suggested IS content will be useful additions 
to identified policies, and that these policies are definitely up for review / potentially going to be 
able to incorporate our evidence  
In closing, Mr. Nawiko thanked all the participants for taking time out of their busy s chedules to 
participate in the equally important activity. He urged them to continue with the same commitment and 
support when ever called on for their expertise.

Transformation pathways are explorative scenarios to transform Guatemala's food system. These pathways were developed with the Disruptive Seeds approach and by a community of 23 grassroots organizations and NGOs, termed ""disruptive seeds"", that are challenging the unsustainable and unjust status quo, showing that people and nature-based solutions can cause power shifts that are necessary to transform food systems. CCDA represents 20,000 rural families in 95% of the national territory. Since 1982 they have legally retrieved 79 indigenous community lands of 500 hectares. Their new strategic plan aims to guide future proposals, enable them to increase their climate resilience, scale efforts to train communities in the defense of their territories, as well as their political lobby for indigenous rights, and more.

Introducción  
 
Este reporte  tiene como objetivo informar sobre los resultados de trabajo derivados del primer Taller de 
Semillas Disruptivas, organizado del 17 al 19 de mayo, 2023 en Panajachel, Guatemala, como parte del 
Paquete de Trabajo No. 3 de la Iniciativa de CGIAR sobre Resiliencia Climática (ClimBeR). En primer lugar, 
el informe presenta un marco general para el enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas: ¿por qué se desarrolló?,  
¿de qué trata?  y ¿qué pretende lograr?  En segundo término, se presenta una descripción general de los 
antecedentes de la Iniciativa ClimBeR y del proyecto Semillas Disruptivas en particular. A continuación, 
el informe se enfoca en la metodología y el programa del Taller, brindando luego una descripción 
general de los resultados alcanzados. El informe finaliza con un recuento de los próximos pasos para el 
proyecto.  
 
1. Semillas Disruptivas : inspiración para la imaginación de futuros 
más sostenibles y justos  
 
Los desafíos ambientales globales que enfrentamos actualmente (degradación ambiental, pérdida de 
biodiversidad, inequidad y cambio climático en particular) exigen un cambio sistémico significativo y 
radical, es decir, transformaciones de sostenibilidad. Tales transformaciones implican inevitablemente 
un cambio de las estructuras de poder actuales e insostenibles a otras nuevas y sostenibles. Sobre la 
base del trabajo de Bennett et al. (2016), presentamos, en este sentido, un nuevo enfoque de escenarios 
que nos permite visualizar transformaciones de sostenibilidad y explorar el papel crucial de las 
dinámicas de poder: el enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas (Rutting et al. 2022). Dicho enfoque fue 
desarrollado en respuesta a la necesidad de un enfoque novedoso para pensar en el futuro, que  
enfatiza elementos “esperanzadores” y se concentra en iniciativas que desafían activamente -desde sus 
fundamentos - a las estructuras y prácticas insostenibles e injustas vigentes, para generar escenarios 
creativos, desarrollados de abajo hacia arriba.  
 
Usamos el término ´ semillas ´ como una metáfora para referirse a iniciativas sociales, tecnológicas, 
económicas o socio -ecológicas que existen, al menos en forma de prototipo, y desafían activamente o 
muestran una alternativa para prácticas  insostenibles o injustas, y representan a una diversidad de 
cosmovisiones, valores y regiones, pero que no  son dominantes en este momento . Estas semillas tienen, 
sin embargo, el potencial de crecer en términos de impacto y eventualmente de reemplazar prácticas y 
estructur as insostenibles, pudiendo de esta manera, ser consideradas como potenciales promotores del 
cambio transformacional. Aunado a eso, dichas semillas pueden representar perspectivas y visiones de 
mundo que difieren en sus fundamentos de los marcos dominantes a nivel mundial, a menudo 
originados en el Norte Global. Esto último es clave por dos motivos. En primer lugar, las perspectivas y 
visiones de mundo que desafían el marco dominante pueden ofrecer formas alternativas de abordar los

5 retos globales antes mencionados y ayudar a romper los bloqueos o “puntos muertos”. En segundo 
lugar, ayudan a que los procesos de toma de decisiones sean más justos y equitativos.  
 
2. La iniciativa ClimBeR de CGIAR en R esiliencia C limática  
 
El proyecto Semillas Disruptivas se lanzó en el año 2022 como parte de la iniciativa Resiliencia Climática 
(ClimBeR por sus siglas en inglés)  de CGIAR. ClimBeR  es una de las iniciativas de la nueva cartera de 
investigación del CGIAR que aportará ciencia e innovación para transformar los sistemas alimentarios, la 
tierra, y el agua frente a una crisis climática. ClimBeR trabajará en Guatemala y otros cinco países, con el 
fin de aumentar la resiliencia de los sistemas de producción de los pequeños agricultores para soportar 
los graves efectos del cambio climático, como las sequías, las inundaciones y las altas temperaturas.  
La variabilidad y los extremos climáticos están teniendo un impacto significativo y adverso en los países 
de ingresos bajos y medios, y este impacto no hará más que empeorar. Los sistemas alimentarios y 
agrícolas se enfrentan a un riesgo especial, con amenazas de pérdidas económicas y de empleo e 
incertidumbre en las inversiones. Los pequeños agricultores, y en particular las mujeres y los jóvenes, se 
han visto afectados en sus esfuerzos por mejorar sus medios de vida, mientras que la pobreza y las 
tensiones sociales aumentan.  
La demanda se ha desplazado desde la comprensión de los impactos del cambio climático hasta el 
diseño de innovaciones y la dirección de los flujos financieros para alcanzar objetivos ambiciosos en 
materia de clima y sistemas alimentarios. Las soluciones de adaptación deben ir más allá de la 
tecnología y tener en cuenta también las consecuencias sociales, medioambientales y económicas: las 
intervenciones aisladas ya no son suficientes. En Guatemala, estas soluciones de adaptación son 
necesarias para hacer frente a las amenazas de los impactos de los fenómenos meteorológicos 
extremos, como las sequías y las altas temperaturas. Trabajar para asegurar la transformación a nivel de 
sistema mejorará la resiliencia, la productividad y la equidad. Trabajando en estrecha colaboración con 
los socios a nivel local, nacional, regional y mundial, el enfoque audaz y único de ClimBeR aborda la 
vulnerabilidad al cambio climático en sus raíces utilizando un marco de adaptación transformadora. El 
trabajo se basa en la trayectoria del CGIAR en materia de investigación agrícola para el desarrollo, que 
incluye diez años de trabajo sobre el cambio climático y la agricultura en el marco del Programa de 
Investigación del CGIAR sobre el Cambio Climático, la Agricultura y la Seguridad Alimentaria (CCAFS), con 
actividades centradas en las siguientes áreas:  
1. Reducción del riesgo para los medios de vida de los productores y las cadenas de valor  
2. Comprender los riesgos de seguridad relacionados con el clima e identificar los caminos hacia la 
paz 
3. Garantizando que los formuladores de políticas tengan la evidencia necesaria para desarrollar 
políticas urgentes, holísticas y específicas del contexto  
4. Desarrollo de capacidades para el desarrollo de políticas que reúnan las necesidades locales y las 
herramientas disponibles para permitir la gobernanza hacia la resiliencia

6. Garantizar la equidad de género y social

3. El Proyecto Semillas Disruptivas  
 
Como un enfoque innovador, el proyecto Semillas Disruptivas complementa otros paquetes de trabajo 
de ClimBeR e inicitiavas de CGIAR, compartiendo el foco en la agricultura climáticamente inteligente, y 
el empoderamiento de comunidades marginadas, mujeres y jóvenes. En este proyecto, combinamos el 
enfoque de ´ semillas ´, que esencialmente es un enfoque de visualización y retrospectiva, con un 
enfoque de escenarios exploratorios de una manera innovadora. El Proyecto consta de cuatro fases 
principales:  
1. La identificación de semillas disruptivas en Guatemala  
2.  El desarrollo de rutas de desarrollo transformativo para el sistema agroalimentario, enfocado 
particularmente en la seguridad y soberanía alimentaria de grupos vulnerables ante la 
variabilidad climática y los eventos extremos, especialmente mujeres, jóvenes y comunidades 
rurales campesinas empobrecidas  
3. El desarrollo de un conjunto de escenarios exploratorios sobre el futuro de Guatemala para 
tomar en cuenta la incertidumbre a futuro (tanto sociopolítica como relativa al cambio 
climático)  
4. Una prueba de robustez de las rutas de desarrollo transformativo utilizando escenarios 
exploratorios para hacerlos más robustos frente a la incertidumbre futura  
En la primera fase se identificaron las semillas disruptivas y otras semillas con capacidad transformadora 
en Guatemala a través de búsquedas en línea, así como a través de la participación y consulta con 
agentes clave, medios de comunicación, y organizaciones nacionales e internaciones en Guatemala. Los 
criterios de selección de semillas disruptivas eran que las semillas se centran en la agricultura sostenible; 
que desafían activamente el régimen agrícola vigente (centrado en la producción, monocultivos, 
dominado por multinacionales, descuidando los valores y prácticas locales/regionales y los aspectos 
ecológicos); y tienen potencial transformador. Con estos criterios, se desarrolló una base de datos de 
más de cincuenta semillas disruptivas en Guatemala. Posteriormente, se utilizó una serie de criterios 
adicionales para priorizar las Semillas que podríamos invitar a participar en el proyecto, siguiendo las 
siguientes preguntas:  
- ¿Desafía la semilla las estructuras de poder actuales?  
- ¿Ofrece alternativas más justas o sostenibles a los sistemas o prácticas actuales? (¿Proporciona 
ideas para la transformación?)  
- ¿Apunta (in)explícitamente a nuevas formas de gobernanza o cambio institucional?  
Page 7:
 
 
7 - ¿Está relacionado con los sistemas alimentarios o la nutrición?  
- ¿Está enfocada en mujeres?  
- ¿Está enfocada en jóvenes?  
- ¿Está liderada por o enfocada en pueblos indígenas?  
- ¿Está activa en áreas geográficas vulnerables ante la variabilidad climática y eventos extremos?  
La fase 2 se centra en e l desarrollo de las rutas de desarrollo transformativo para el sistema 
agroalimentario de Guatemala, y está descrito en este informe.  
Más adelante, en la fase 3, nos alejaremos de los futuros deseables, es decir, de la pregunta ""¿qué 
queremos que suceda?"" , y nos centraremos en los futuros posibles (""¿qué podría pasar?"" ). Con este fin, 
utilizamos un enfoque de escenarios exploratorios.  
Finalmente, en la fase 4, reuniremos los resultados de las fases 2 y 3. Esta última fase del proyecto se 
centra en la pregunta: ¿serían exitosas las vías de transformación en una variedad de escenarios futuros 
diferentes, cada uno de los cuales ofrece diferentes desafíos y oportunidades?  
 
4. Objetivos y programa del taller  
 
1. Co-crear rutas de desarrollo transformativo para el sistema agroalimentario de Guatemala 
basadas en semillas disruptivas. Estas rutas serán usadas para orientar la planificación y las 
inversiones a corto, mediano y largo plazo de organizaciones gubernamentales y /o no 
gubernamentales.  
2. Apoyar el fortalecimiento de semillas disruptivas en Guatemala, a través de la facilitación de un 
espacio de intercambio entre las personas representantes de éstas.  
 
Durante este primer taller, nos enfocamos en desarrollar vías de transformación generadas por agentes 
clave. Se invitó a una variedad de partes interesadas, principalmente representantes de Semillas 
Disruptivas de organizaciones de base, así como organismos no gubernamentales, medios de 
comunicación, actores del sector privado, actores gubernamentales, de investigación y  organizaciones 
internacionales . 
En relación al segundo objetivo del taller, se organizó un figurativo ´Mercado de Semillas´, donde 
representantes de Semillas presentaron lo que tienen para ofrecer a otras organizaciones presentes en 
cuanto a conocimiento o experiencia (oferta), y lo que necesitan para desarrollarse o crecer (demanda). 
De esta manera, el taller fue el inicio de un proceso para apoyar el fortalecimiento de las Semillas 
Disruptivas a través del intercambio de experiencias, experticia y conocimiento entre ellas.

5. Metodología del taller  
 
El enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas es, en esencia, un enfoque de visualización y retrospectiva, que tiene 
como objetivo imaginar futuros esperanzadores para, posteriormente, proporcionar orientación al 
desarrollo de un camino o una ruta política hacia tales futuros. El enfoque se basa en la premisa de que 
las transformaciones hacia la sostenibilidad probablemente no sean procesos de transición suaves. Los 
actores dominantes que se benefician del sistema actual ejercerán poder en defensa del status quo, y 
las semillas de cambio transformador tendrán que desafiar de alguna manera a estos sistemas y actores 
dominantes. Con este fin, incorporamos conocimientos clave de la literatura sobre dinámicas de poder y 
cambios de transición/transformación (Avelino 2017, Brisbois 2019, van Rijnsoever y Leendertse 2020, 
Feola et al. 2021, ver tabla 1). Este enfoque renovado, al que llamamos enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas, 
es un enfoque de investigación acción participativa (IAP), en el que los participantes contribuyen a la 
construcción nuevos conocimientos y colaboran en pequeños grupos que representan diferentes 
sectores, disciplinas, perspectivas y grupos de interés (Rutting et al. 2022).  
 
El enfoque consta de dos pasos principales: el primer paso es imaginar un futuro en el que una semilla 
disruptiva en particular se haya vuelto dominante y, por lo tanto, parte de un nuevo régimen. Durante 
este paso, los participantes pensarán en cómo se vería la semilla en su forma madura (es decir, cuando 
se haya vuelto dominante), así como lo que esto significa para el mundo en el que existe esta semilla: 
¿Quiénes son los ganadores y los perdedores de este mundo futuro en particular? ¿Qué otros impactos 
Page 10:
 
 
10 tendría esto?  Usaremos la denominada “Rueda del Futuro” para pensar en tales repercusiones (ver 
figura 1).  
 
 
 
Figura 1.  Ejemplo de una Rueda del Futuro que representa impactos de primer orden y ganadores y perdedores de 
una semilla en su forma madura  (en el centro)  (Rutting et al, 2022) . 
 
El segundo paso es explorar y explicar cómo se llevarán a cabo los cambios de poder necesarios para la 
transformación del actual régimen vigente al futuro visualizado durante el paso 1. Durante este segundo 
paso, el Modelo de Tres Horizontes (ver figura 2), que es una forma sencilla de visualizar las 
transformaciones, se utiliza para guiar la reflexión y discusión entre las personas participantes. Más 
importante aún, formulamos un conjunto de preguntas basadas en la literatura sobre 
transiciones/transformaciones de poder, que buscan ayudar a articular cómo se pueden desarrollar 
realmente tales transformaciones. Estas preguntas fomentan a hacer explícito cómo ocurren los 
cambios de poder (ver tabla 1).

Tabla 1: Conjunto de preguntas para guiar las discusiones sobre los cambios de poder en las 
transformaciones y hacerlos explícitos (Rutting et al, 2022)  
Preguntas atinentes al régimen  Preguntas atinentes a las semillas  
¿Cuáles son los elementos clave y las 
interacciones del sistema actual (el régimen)?  ¿Cuál es el enfoque de la semilla (sistema nicho);

¿Cómo ejerce y refuerza el régimen actual su 
poder?  ¿Qué estrategias utiliza para defenderse a 
sí mismo o a sus estructuras?  ¿Cómo ejerce la semilla su poder de transformación?

¿Qué recursos se utilizan o necesitan?  
¿Cómo puede este poder transformador alterar las 
estructuras del régimen actual?

¿Emplea el régimen la coerción o la 
manipulación? ¿Quién hace lobby por el régimen 
y cómo?  ¿Cómo se puede lograr el cambio ""ajustándose a las 
reglas"" del régimen?   
Preguntas generales: ¿Cómo ocurre este cambio de poder? Describa las luchas de poder y los cambios: 
¿cómo pasamos de la situación actual a la visión del mundo en la que la semilla es dominante? ¿Hay 
puntos de inflexión?  
 
Abordar estas preguntas proporciona importantes componentes para el desarrollo de un escenario 
futuro que describe el proceso de transformación del sistema actual en el presente hacia uno alternativo 
y sostenible en el futuro. Esto, a su vez, informa a la formulación de vías o rutas políticas de 
transformación. La combinación del enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas con la planificación de escenarios 
exploratorios puede ayudar a que tales vías o rutas políticas sean más robustas frente a la incertidumbre 
futura.  
En resumen, la metodología diseñada para el taller de Semillas Disruptivas en Guatemala  consta de 
cuatro pasos:  
1. La creación de una visión a futuro de la semilla en su forma madura: Este primer paso se centra 
en imaginar cómo se verían las semillas concentradas e n una t emática en su forma madura; 
cuáles impactos tienen en este mundo a f uturo; y quié nes son los ganadores y perdedores del 
nuevo régimen sostenible y justo.  Esto se visualiza en una ´ rueda del futuro ´ 
2. La creación de las rutas de desarrollo transformativo. Este segundo paso se centra en analizar 
cómo llegar a ese futuro, es decir, cómo sería la transformación y qué cambios de poder deben 
ocurrir para que la semilla se vuelva dominante y florezca como parte del nuevo régimen. Las 
rutas se crean de la siguiente manera:  
a. Para analizar a fondo el desarrollo transformador que es necesario, en primer lugar las 
personas participantes contestan una serie de preguntas sobre el régimen  injusto e 
insostenible establecido, y otra serie de preguntas sobre la Semilla Disruptiva, y cómo 
muestra alternativas al régimen .  
b. Luego, las respuestas a estas preguntas facilitan la formulación de  las rutas de desarrollo 
transformativo , cuales son visualizados en una línea de tiempo, y descritas en una 
narrativa. Adicionalmente, se usa el Modelo de Tres Horizontes  para guiar las 
discusiones.  
c. Finalmente, cada grupo de trabajo define objetivos de política  que pueden ayudar a 
realizarse la ruta de transformación. En esencia, se trata de un proceso de visualización y 
retrospectiva: en primer lugar, se evoca una visión de futuro deseable con base en las 
semillas y, en segundo lugar, se construye la trayectoria hacia este futuro en base a un 
proceso de razonamiento retrospectivo hacia el presente.  
3. El paso 3, posteriormente, se centra en identificar las sinergias entre las diferentes rutas de 
transformación. Esto se hace en plenaria, después de que cada grupo temática haya presentado 
su trabajo.

políticas  que pueden beneficiarse de las rutas de desarrollo transformativo.  
 
6. Resultados del taller  
 
Mercado de Semillas  
 
Al inicio del taller se organizó un figurativo ´Mercado de Semillas´, en que personas representantes de 
las organizaciones presentes (llamadas ´ Semillas Disruptivas ´) anotaron y presentaron lo que tienen para 
ofrecer a otras organizaciones presentes en cuanto a conocimiento o experiencia (oferta), y lo que 
necesitan para desarrollarse o crecer (demanda). De esta manera, el taller fue el inicio de un proceso 
para apoyar el fortalecimiento de las Semillas Disruptivas a través del intercambio de experiencias, 
experticia y conocimiento entre ellas.  
En este ejercicio los participantes notaron que hay muchísimo conocimiento y experticia para compartir, 
para así ayudarse y fortalecerse entre las Semillas Disruptivas. También se mencionó la necesidad de dar 
seguimiento posterior al taller al mercado de semillas, para asegurarse que las participantes estén 
conscientes de las posibles conexiones entre ellas; exploren cómo se pueden apoyar; y que el proyecto 
ClimBeR a su vez facilita estos intercambios y el escalamiento de sus iniciativas. Finalmente, los 
organizadores del taller también mencionaron que investigarán y comunicarán cuales necesidades en 
conocimiento pueden ser apoyadas a través de iniciativas de CGIAR presentes en Guatemala.

Ecological risks and risk mitigation 
measures related to water quality and 
agriculture Chapter8
Birguy Lamizana and Pay Drechsel
Freshwater ecosystem health is under multiple pressures (Fig 8.1) with water pollution and quality 
being a key factor. Farming is in this context an intrusion on the natural habitat and landscape of 
the environment. The farming of crops (particularly mono-cropping practices) is not only affecting 
biodiversity but also changes natural water flows and can negatively affect water quality (APO, 
2016). While pollution of the natural environment – and water bodies in particular – derives from 
various point and non-point sources including urban wastewater, this chapter focuses on pollution 
from agricultural activities, i.e., an aspect over which farmers have control. Possible impacts from 
pollution related to water quality can be various and relate to both irrigated and non-irrigated 
(rainfed) cropping, as well as fish and livestock farming.

United Nations Environment Programme.
The most common water pollution pathways in agricultural areas are erosion and water body 
siltation, farm surface runoff contaminated with fresh manure, fertilizers or pesticides, and saline 
irrigation drainage water affecting downstream ecology. Nitrogen and phosphorus overuse can also 
pose a significant threat to environmental health, biodiversity and ecosystem services, especially in 
locations with high fertilizer application rates.
This chapter briefly describes these risks as well as common indicators and risk mitigation 
measures of relevance to agriculture. In so doing, it aims to demonstrate the need for a systems or 
landscape approach when considering downstream impacts through good agricultural practices.

Water quality in agriculture: Risks and risk mitigation8.1. Risks of relevance to ecology
Rivers, streams and wetlands in general are the receptacle of all kinds of pollution, and constitute 
pathways for pollutants to coastal and marine waters or lakes. According to UNEP (2016), in Africa, 
Asia and Latin America, one-third of all rivers are affected by severe pathogen pollution, one-
seventh by severe organic pollution, and one-tenth by severe and moderate salinity pollution. 
Inorganic pollution represents a particular threat to ambient water quality occurring when an 
excess of easily biodegradable wastes (e.g. nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium 
from agricultural land, livestock farming or aquaculture) enters rivers and lakes through run-off 
and erosion (UN Water, 2016). Global estimates suggest that soil erosion by water is responsible for 
annual fluxes of 23–42 Mt of nitrogen and 14.6–26.4 Mt of phosphorus from agricultural land (FAO & 
ITPS, 2015).
Nitrates and phosphates can stimulate excessive plant growth and lead to eutrophication – the 
over-productivity of plant organisms in water – resulting in the creation of algal blooms and the 
depletion of oxygen concentrations, which in turn decreases aquatic biodiversity (UNEP, 2016; UN 
Water, 2016). Observed consequences of eutrophication in freshwater wetland systems include 
shifts in vascular plant species composition due to an increase in above-ground production, a 
decrease in local or regional biodiversity, growth in the competitive advantage of aggressive/
invasive species, loss of nutrient retention capacity (e.g. carbon and nitrogen storage, changes in 
plant litter decomposition) and shifts in macroinvertebrate composition along an eutrophication 
gradient (USEPA, 2008). Conservative estimates of the costs of eutrophication amount to USD  
1 billion in annual losses for European coastal waters and USD 2.4 billion for lakes and streams in the 
United States (Wurtsbaugh, Paerl & Dodds, 2019).
Aside agro-chemical transport through run-off and erosion, water quality problems can also arise 
from suspended soil particles themselves, which cause turbidity and siltation of water bodies, 
leading eventually to increased sedimentation of reservoirs, for example. While soil erosion and 
sediment transport are natural processes, deforestation, land clearance for agriculture and 
inappropriate agriculture practices can substantially increase the amount of suspended solids 
and turbidity in the water, which can lead to multiple undesirable effects for aquatic plants, algae, 
invertebrates and fish (Dunlop, McGregor & Horrigan, 2005). Increased turbidity may limit, for 
example, the growth of bottom-rooted aquatic plants and favour the growth of algae. It can result 
in reduced visibility for animals that use sight to find food or hide from predators, affect spawning 
habitats and provoke respiratory problems in fish. Increased sedimentation also leads to infilling of 
reservoirs, clogging of waterways and alteration of flow patterns (FAO, 2018). 
Some 30 percent of the world’s freshwater stocks are found beneath ground that is tapped to supply 
water for domestic and agricultural needs (UNEP, 2010). Depending on the characteristics of farm 
soils and their underlying geology, groundwater is less exposed to pollutants than surface waters; 
however, they can be heavily impacted when pollutants infiltrate coarse textured substrates with 
limited filtration. Contamination of soils and groundwater can be caused by irrigation practices 
leading to salinity through nitrate and pesticide leaching, or the accumulation of chemicals or 
pathogens where wastewater is used. 
Wetlands can function as natural “kidneys” that filter and improve water quality, attenuate and 
moderate floodwater flows, replenish groundwater and recharge underlying aquifers. In addition to 
110
Page 5:
Ecological risks and risk mitigation measures related to water quality and agricultureproviding multiple ecosystem services, wetlands also support biodiversity. However, many wetlands 
have been degraded by excessive volumes of contaminants, or encroachment, diminishing their 
capacity to improve water quality and provide other services.
8.2. Water quality and ecosystem health criteria
Aquatic life water quality indicators and criteria are essential for the protection of fish and wildlife. 
In general, indicators for freshwater ecosystems can be categorized in terms of quantity (e.g., flow 
volumes), quality (e.g., dissolved oxygen, specific nutrients or toxicants), habitat (e.g., substrates, 
bank stability or riparian vegetation), and biological criteria (e.g., fish, invertebrates, algae) (UNEP, 
2018).
Criteria, in particular those showing concentrations of pollutants, are typically expressed in two 
forms to address unacceptable adverse effects from both short-term (acute) and long-term 
(chronic) exposure, with the objective of protecting aquatic life from lethal as well as sub-lethal 
effects, like immobility, slower growth, or reduced reproduction. 
Acute and chronic criteria for aquatic life addressing magnitude, duration, and frequency are 
expressed with two terms (USEPA, 2021):
• Criterion Maximum Concentration (CMC). An estimate of the highest concentration of a  
 material in ambient water to which an aquatic community can be exposed briefly without   
 resulting in an unacceptable adverse effect. This is the acute criterion. 
• Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC). An estimate of the highest concentration of a   
 material in ambient water to which an aquatic community can be exposed indefinitely without  
 resulting in an unacceptable adverse effect. This is the chronic criterion.
The USEPA (2022) national aquatic life criteria recommendations represent specific CMC and CCC 
levels of inorganic and organic chemicals or conditions in a fresh and salt water body not expected 
to cause adverse effects to aquatic life. 
An alternative framework has been presented by UNEP (2018) based on various national and 
international guidelines. In Table 8.1 values for physical and chemical indicators of freshwater 
ecosystem quality are proposed which are indicative of (i) high ecosystem integrity, and (ii) extreme 
impairment, respectively. The first benchmark value will separate freshwater ecosystems of high 
integrity (Category 1) from ecosystems in worse quality status. The second benchmark demarcates 
the low end of the quality continuum: Ecosystem quality status should be above this threshold, 
otherwise the water body would lose with high probability aquatic diversity and beneficial use and 
ecosystems will face severe reduction or complete loss of Ecosystem Services (Category 4).

Ecological risks and risk mitigation measures related to water quality and agricultureAs Table 8.1 shows, there is often a grey area between good and highly impaired water quality. 
Indeed, some criteria depend on other water quality characteristics, such as alkalinity, hardness, pH, 
suspended solids and salinity, which alter inter alia the biological availability and/or toxicity of certain 
chemicals (see footnotes for Table 8.1). As a result, water quality varies naturally with a site’s specific 
physical, chemical and/or biological conditions, depending among others on geology and season (e.g. 
the sediment load is higher after rains than before). This natural variation constitutes a significant 
challenge for applying ‘generic’ thresholds to a local context. Thus, for any work with water quality 
criteria, USEPA (2000, 2008) and UNEP (2018) recommend to first define a natural baseline (Figure 8.2).

8.3. Risk mitigation measures
Applying an ecosystem health approach necessitates adopting precaution as a fundamental 
principle to enable water bodies to provide and secure their respective ecosystem services in a  
sustainable manner. The precautionary principle contrasts with the “impair-and-then-repair” 
paradigm, which remains common practice in water resources engineering and development (UNEP, 
2018). As water quality monitoring has a low coverage in many regions, a precautionary approach 
focuses first of all on preventing possible harm, which requires awareness about ecosystem 
services and downstream impacts. A key advantage of the precautionary approach is that farmers 
have no need to access laboratories or to understand the water quality parameters discussed 
above. This also represents an advantage where emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical 
residues are concerned, as laboratories in many low-income countries lack sufficient equipment 
and no thresholds are yet in place to quantify the associated risk.
To prevent erosion and pollution before they impact waterways and water quality, FAO, USDA and 
many others have developed critical control points (e.g. Table 8.2) and good agricultural practices 
(Table 8.3). These help avoid over-fertilization, increases in soil salinity and pesticide-related 
ecological trade-offs, among others (e.g. FAO, 2007, 2010). Similar guides exist for livestock (e.g. 
FAO & IDF, 2004; FAO & OIE, 2009) and fish farming (e.g. ASEAN, 2015). The spectrum of good 
practices is vast and requires adaptation to local circumstances and farmer’s limitations and 
opportunities (e.g. in view of the reduction or replacement of chemicals or the availability of plants 
for hedgerows to reduce runoff).

Where polluted water leaves livestock or fish farms, on-site water treatment should be considered, 
for example through the construction of artificial wetlands (Wang et al. , 2018). Farmers can also 
minimize pollution affecting their soil and crop health through low quality irrigation water, by 
adopting water efficient irrigation practices which minimize the volumes of water needed. 
Table 8.3 provides an overview of possible water quality impacts from agriculture on water bodies, 
and examples of good agricultural practices to avoid or reduce risks for water quality and ecology. 
Specific challenges for crops and soils and related mitigation measures are also addressed in 
Chapters 4 and 5 dedicated to pathogenic and chemical risks including salinity.
On-farm activities Challenges for water bodies Good agricultural practices for risk mitigation
Tillage/ ploughing Depending on topography and rainfall, increase of 
runoff, sedimentation and turbidity: phosphorus 
and pesticides adsorbed onto sediment particles; 
siltation of river beds and loss of habitat, spawning 
grounds, etc.Minimize erosion and farm runoff through cover 
crops, mulching, hedgerows, etc., consider zero-
tillage.
Fertilizer use and manure 
spreadingDepending on dosage, slope and soil conditions, 
possible runoff resulting in contamination of 
receiving waters with phosphorus and nitrogen, 
leading to water eutrophication, excess algal 
growth, water deoxygenation and loss of fish 
biodiversity), as well as contamination through 
pathogens and antibiotics from manure. Leaching 
of nitrates to groundwater potentially threatening 
public health.Use locally recommended fertilizer dosages. 
Prevent farm runoff, for example by building anti-
erosion structures and planting grass rows across 
slopes.
Pesticide application Runoff of pesticides leads to contamination 
of water bodies affecting their biota, including 
possible public health impacts from eating 
contaminated fish. Apply Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for 
pests and diseases, including the use of biological 
pesticides where possible. Use only locally 
recommended dosages and prevent farm runoff.
Irrigation infrastructure  Changing the natural patterns of river flow and 
the creation of irrigation dams can block the 
movements of fish and affect whole ecosystems.Adopt environmentally sound standards to make 
decisions regarding location, type and operation of 
future reservoirs and dams.Table 8.3. Agricultural impacts on water quality and related mitigation optionsChemical hazards Control points

Ecological risks and risk mitigation measures related to water quality and agriculture8.4. Adopting good agricultural practices 
To facilitate the adoption of good agricultural practices, farmers have to be trained, and their 
awareness as a community member on upstream-downstream impacts and ecosystem services 
increased. However, training alone might not translate into behaviour change (Drechsel, Qadir &, 
Galibourg, 2022). Incentive systems, like payments for environmental services (PES), might be 
required where without tangible benefits farmers do not accept responsibility for downstream Irrigation water 
management (effects 
on farm soils, crops and 
human health)Use of low-quality water, such as (diluted) 
wastewater affecting soil and crop health and 
potentially consumers; possible bioaccumulation 
of chemicals in crops or fish.
Runoff of chemicals to surface waters or 
infiltration into groundwater affecting downstream 
water bodies and communities
Too low/high irrigation amounts causing salt 
accumulation in the rooting zone or groundwater.Use safe irrigation practices and a multi-barrier 
approach to minimize contaminant transfer.
Prevent uncontrolled drainage. Build natural water 
filtration or sedimentation infrastructure (wetlands, 
bunds, ponds, terraces) to maximize on-plot water 
use (and minimize run-off).
Adjust irrigation techniques, intervals and amounts 
to water and soil salinity, reclamation of saline or 
sodic soils; use of more resistant crops.
Clearcutting, 
afforestation and 
reforestationChanges in land cover can increase soil exposure, 
compaction, runoff and sedimentation, alter 
hydrological flows and provoke a decline in 
riparian areas affecting water and land quality 
and biodiversity. Soil compaction limits water 
infiltration.Implement anti-erosion measures; ensure the 
conservation of valuable plants (e.g. fruit trees).
Use good silvicultural practices, such as the 
watershed management module of FAO’s 
Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) Toolbox (FAO, 
2017).
Animal husbandry, 
feedlots, animal 
corrals and their waste 
managementContamination of waterbodies with pathogens 
(bacteria, viruses, etc.) leading potentially 
to chronic public health problems. Also 
contamination by metals, antibiotics and other 
pharmaceuticals contained in livestock urine and 
faeces. Potential leaching of nitrogen, metals, etc. 
to groundwater.Use chemicals (fertilizers, agricultural and veterinary 
chemicals, pesticides, etc.). appropriately to avoid 
contamination of the local environment. 
Have a waste (water) management system in place. 
Capture and treat farm off-flow before it enters 
natural water bodies.
Aquaculture, fish feeding 
and waste managementRelease of pond water with high levels of nutrients 
(through feed and faeces) to surface water and 
groundwater leading to serious eutrophication. 
Within-lake cage farming is considered one of 
the major stressors on lake water quality. Organic 
and nutrient loading can easily result in organic 
accumulation in the sediment with lake water 
quality deterioration, accelerating the process 
of lake eutrophication and toxic cyanobacterial 
bloom. Introduction of exotic species can severely 
affect local biodiversity.Use chemicals (fertilizers, agricultural and veterinary 
chemicals, pesticides, etc.). appropriately to avoid 
contamination of the local environment.

guidelines for pond effluents. In the example of 
Thailand (ACFS, 2009), the law requires effluent to 
be treated prior to discharge. If farm size is over 1.6 
ha, the effluent parameters shall meet the following 
specification:
•   BOD not above 20 mg/l.
•   Suspension solid not above 80 mg/l.
•   NH3-N not above 1.1 mg/l.
•   Total Nitrogen not above 4.0 mg/l.
•   Total Phosphorus not above 0.5 mgP/l.
•   pH 6.5-8.5
Exotic fish species should not pose a risk to the 
natural biodiversity and ecosystem health.

impacts of their actions. What can trigger behaviour change has, however, to be explored in each 
local context. Another possible incentive for the adoption of good agricultural practices is the 
increasing availability of national and international certification programmes or schemes. Increasing 
consumer demand for confidence in safe and sustainable food, and the need among retailers for 
a dependable tool to evaluate suppliers underline the importance of certification. Such forms of 
certification can be voluntary or mandatory, as in the case of outgrowers or export crops farmers. 
Even where voluntary, local farms can request certification of their good agricultural practices. In 
such cases, farm audits are carried out to ensure that farms are complying with the certification 
requirements (SFA, 2019; APO, 2016; QUACERT, 2020). Some schemes ask for farm conservation 
plans (i.e. a written action plan on the conservation of flora, fauna and natural resources in the 
wider farm area). Certification can provide several benefits for farmers, such as better and easier 
access to the market and clear agreements and dialogue with retailers. However, where consumers’ 
ecological or risk awareness is low, certification might only reach domestic niche markets but 
remains an option for export crops (Keraita & Drechsel, 2015).

An accelerated programme of the finalisation has targeted the government launch of the NCCAP 2023-2027 at the Africa Climate Summit, in Kenya, in September 2023. The representatives of indigenous peoples, who included a representation of women, youth, and persons with disabilities, at the meeting for 3rd and 4th August 2023, discussed their experiences about environmental justice and its cross-cutting aspects within the 7 sectors. This discussion is geared towards generating data that will inform the development of the NCCAP 2023-27 and influence policy positions including the upcoming Africa Climate Summit, the UNFCCC processes and the national climate change policies and initiatives.

This provides opportunities to showcase and promote nature-based solutions (NBS) informed by
indigenous peoples' beliefs, value systems, and ways of knowing. This is critical because food security
and human rights of indigenous peoples, including pastoralist, forest, and fisher communities must be
protected, promoted, and always enjoyed and all places. the food systems approach provides a
comprehensive and holistic perspective on agriculture and food security in line with paragraph 14 (a) of
the SSJW on the implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security which underscores
that the joint work should aim at “promoting a holistic approach to addressing issues related to
agriculture and food security”. This  workshop provided a platform for indigenous peoples’ representatives to outline their priority
needs to input into Third National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP, 2023-27) that is led by the
Ministry of Environment and Forestry through the Climate Change Directorate. An accelerated
programme of the finalisation has targeted the government launch of the NCCAP 2023-2027 at the
Africa Climate Summit, in Kenya, in September 2023. 
The representatives of indigenous peoples, who included a representation of women, youth, and
persons with disabilities, at the meeting for 3rd and 4th August 2023, discussed their experiences
about environmental justice and its cross-cutting aspects within the 7 sectors. This discussion is
geared towards generating data that will inform the development of the NCCAP 2023-27 and influence
policy positions including the upcoming Africa Climate Summit, the UNFCCC processes and the
national climate change policies and initiatives. This meeting provided opportunities for translating
constitutional & policy gains in recognition of indigenous knowledge systems and practices related to
climate change into meaningful programs and actions at the county and country levels.
The NCCAP 2023-2027 provides a welcome opportunity to mainstream ownership and access rights
for indigenous communities, for them to effectively engage in sustainable livelihoods. This will
contribute to the country being able to meet other rights like the right to food, across a bigger section
of the population, considering that indigenous peoples are more than 20% of Kenya’s population.
Indigenous Peoples interventions seek to contribute to the four-year Sharm el-Sheikh Joint Work
(SSJW) on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security, especially by pushing for
the food systems approach, ensuring sustainability and hence deliver food security and nutrition for all
(especially indigenous peoples, including the disadvantaged gender groups), without compromising the
welfare of future generations through harmful economic, social, and environmental practices.

Page 3:
Indigenous peoples’ organised participation in the on-going development of the National Climate Change Action
Plan 2023-27 is of critical importance. These communities occupy areas that are most sensitive to climate change,
and being totally natural resource dependent for their livelihood, they are disproportionately affected by climate
change impacts. This is because climate change presents an added burden to them as they already disadvantaged
socially, politically, and economically by the fact that they are marginalised. Comprising of about 20% of the
Kenyan population, according to the most recent 2019 census, it is, therefore, imperative that any planned
decision likely to affect their livelihoods should include their priorities, views, dreams, and aspirations. Climate
change response is one such decision
The objectives
Ensure placeholders and anchors for the
promotion and application of indigenous
knowledge in climate change programming and
actions are integrated into the NCCAP 2023 - 27
Contribute towards operationalisation of
constitutionally guaranteed rights and affirmative
action principles in access to climate finance for
IPs ... ensuring those with the least Carbon
footprint, most negatively impacted by climate
change are safeguarded against further impact
and support for enhanced resilience/adaptation.  
Ensuring the legislative and policy gains with
respect to indigenous peoples’ representation and
consultation in decision-making arrangements
related to climate change include in the National
Climate Change Council, national oversight board
for REDD+, IPs action plan in REDD+ and FPIC are
integrated into the NCCAP.1.

Expected Output 
The output for this workshop is the Draft National
Climate Change Action Plan with inputs from the
indigenous communities. 
Expected Outcomes 
Indigenous people should with deep understanding of their roles
Voice out IP concerns through a public participation in the NCCAP process
An engagement for climate information, engagement,, and inclusion 
A partnership between the Kenya Human Rights Commission with CEMIRIDE Importance of indigenous peoples in the NCCAP process. 
Their participation is also envisaged under the
Constitution of Kenya 2010 as well as the Climate
Change Act of 2016. Indigenous people’s voices are,
therefore, critical in ensuring success of intervention
measures as well the needs, perspectives and
experiences they bring on board through their
indigenous and local knowledge.
“Indigenous peoples’ voices
are critical in revitalizing
traditional knowledge and
technologies in agriculture ,
bio diversity conversation,
and natural resource
management, which is key
to attaining climate
resilience” Nyang’ori
Ohenjo, CEMIRIDE

action through NCCAP to secure Indigenous Peoples'
Livelihoods- StellaMaris Mulaeh(Fasternaktion)
Key message
Indigenous Peoples' interaction with food systems,
has proved a dynamic innovator and co-creator for
knowledge for all humanity. Indigenous peoples
generate hundreds of food items from the
environment without depleting natural resources
and achieve high levels of self-sufficiency.
Enhance, protect and restore indigenous food ways
Continuous updating of knowledge on traditions, cultural systems and practices, including
rotational farming, gathering, fishing, trapping, food gardens and cultivation.Pastoralism and biodiversity
 Genetic Level: Pastoralists often rely on locally adapted livestock breeds and crop varieties that can resist
disease outbreaks, drought, and other pressures, including climate change.
Species Level:  By retaining species and management practices that have evolved in parallel with the local
environment, pastoralists retain important species interactions (e.g. herbivory, host-parasite, and nutrient
cycling), which benefit many wild species of plants, birds, and insects.
Ecosystem Level:  Many ecosystems have evolved because of interactions with grazers. For example,
pastoralism maintains a patchwork of habitats including open areas, which are important for nesting birds.
Furthermore, livestock are important contributors to food cycles.
 Traditional migratory and cross-border pastoralism: conservation of grazing territories and their utilisation
for meat, milk, fibre, fuel, and others
Core Principles in Climate Justice
• Self-determination
• Collective rights
• Gender equality
• Participation and inclusion
• Cultural rights
• Rights over lands and other natural resources

The Importance of Indigenous Voices in Climate Change Policy –
Nyang’ori Ohenjo 
Nyang’ori Ohenjo using the Voices for Change video explained why it was important to use documented
voices of indigenous peoples and their practices to influence policy discussions and negotiations in climate
change.
He noted that CEMIRIDE has partnered with CGIAR through IRRI, in its
Climber project to document the voices of pastoralists and forest peoples
on climate change, food security, and human rights, and these stories
were being used to communicate with policymakers. 
This was an interesting strategy since it provided the avenue for
communities to communicate more authentically, and with unadulterated
content to policymakers, drawing a more real picture of the situation,
especially where good practices that could be scaled up were concerned.
A video by Jane Chepkwony, on how she and her family navigated the
challenges of prolonged drought was shared. This story provides valuable
lessons about how indigenous knowledge and technology around
pastoralism can be adapted to design indigenous peoples' friendly
climate change adaptation programmes like pasture. He explained that in the current context where the impacts of climate change on IPs were intensifying, IPs
need to strengthen and diversify the strategies that they were using to reach out to critical audiences, to
secure their livelihoods (pastoralism, fisheries, and forest livelihood practices like beekeeping). 
Participants strongly related their experiences with the story of Jane. During the plenary discussion, many
participants expressed similarities between intensifying drought and reducing land spaces hence the need to
save the indigenous pasture seed and adapt other technologies like drought-resistant crops for enhancing
resilience to climate change impacts.

Climate Change Impacts
Kenya’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions represent less than
1% of total global emissions. 
Kenya's Economy is heavily dependent on climate-sensitive
sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, tourism, wildlife,
and health that are heavily impacted by climate change. 
The Economic Survey for 2017 reports that the economic cost
of droughts is estimated to create an average long-term fiscal
liability equivalent to 3% of GDP (equivalent to KES 230
billion per annum).
The floods in early 2018 claimed lives and displaced hundreds
of thousands. 
The flood was preceded by the 2014-18 droughts which were
declared a national emergency in February 2017 and affected

Strengthening the Engagement Framework to effectively voice the IPs' issues on Climate Change
deliberations in the national platform.
These are the agreed and adopted areas to be addressed in the NCCAP document to be
presented to the Directorate of Climate Change, Ministry of Environment, and Forestry
A recommendation was adopted to develop an indigenous word that is equivalent to the
word “Agroecology. 
Pastoralism was recognised as a livelihood in the country in 2007 but needs to be
supported in the national budget as an integral part of the economy.
The need to develop a curriculum for pastoralism through deliberate space in the NCCAP
document.
Capture the indigenous TIMPS
With the right there is political goodwill we need to see that the IDPs issue should be
included in all the 7 sectors/strategic objects of NCCAP 
That IPs should be on the validation table before the Plan is signed into operation. These  items listed were drawn from the strategic objects in the NCCAP 2017-2022.

Climate Action Implementation to Achieve Food Security
Slide 1
❑Agriculture, CC & marginalization are strongly connected. CC impacts on 
agriculture disproportionately affect marginalized= more exposed to hazards.
Indigenous communities need access to and control over their assets = must 
participate in decisions concerning the use of natural resources and the 
policies concerning food systems.
❑Women, youth, as well as persons with disabilities in particular are often not 
granted their rights and find themselves excluded from participation in decisions 
that concern their daily lives.

 Implementación del Marco Nacional de Servicios Climáticos (MNSC), paso 11
Este texto documenta y sistematiza la información de fuentes oficiales nacionales 
e internacionales, los resultados del taller interinstitucional Capacidades de los 
servicios climáticos en Guatemala y la identificación de los actores que están 
involucrados en la cadena de los servicios climáticos, tales como proveedores, 
investigadores y usuarios. 
La parte analítica del informe Capacidades de los servicios climáticos en 
Guatemala se basa en el documento Directrices detalladas para la creación 
de un marco nacional para los servicios climáticos publicado en 2018 por la 
Organización Meteorológica Mundial, el cual describe los lineamientos para la 
puesta en marcha de la creación de un MNSC, y define las responsabilidades, 
acciones y vinculaciones de las partes interesadas a nivel local, nacional y 
regional. 
El MNSC es relevante para la sociedad, porque plantea cómo enfrentar los retos 
de los sectores sociales, económicos y ambientales que son más sensibles a las 
condiciones climáticas. Presta especial atención a los aspectos de salud, agua, 
agricultura, seguridad alimentaria y la reducción de riesgo de desastres.
Actualmente, en el contexto global, existen múltiples amenazas naturales y 
antrópicas que, al interactuar con la vulnerabilidad, incrementan el riesgo de 
que ocurran daños directos o indirectos en diversos sectores. Por lo tanto, se 
prevé una mayor demanda de servicios climáticos accesibles y precisos que 
satisfagan las necesidades de la población guatemalteca, principalmente, la que 
habita en las regiones más desamparadas y que aún no cuentan con cobertura 
de los servicios climáticos (Naciones Unidas [UN], 2018).
Según el Banco de Guatemala (Banguat, 2019), la agricultura, ganadería, caza, 
silvicultura, pesca y explotación de minas y canteras conforman el sector 
económico primario en Guatemala. Durante 2019 representó el 10.9 % del 
producto interno bruto (PIB) del país y creció el 2.3 %. Esto es importante 
para el MNSC, pues los principales usuarios finales de los servicios climáticos 
corresponden al ámbito agropecuario que depende directamente de las 
condiciones meteorológicas y de la variabilidad del clima.PRESENTACIÓN

El objetivo de este documento es presentar un panorama general sobre los 
avances de la creación del Marco Nacional de los Servicios Climáticos (MNSC) 
en Guatemala, a partir de lo cual, se asume el compromiso de promover el MNSC, 
de manera que sea funcional y permita el crecimiento de todos los sectores 
productivos relacionados con los servicios climáticos, que son sensibles a las 
condiciones del clima.
Finalmente, se reconoce que la elaboración conjunta del informe ha significado 
una gran experiencia para las instituciones participantes, ya que integra la 
visión de diferentes actores y representantes del sector. También se valora el 
aporte del Sistema Guatemalteco de Ciencias del Cambio Climático (SGCCC), la 
Universidad Rafael Landívar (a través del Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias 
Naturales y Tecnología, Iarna) y de la OMM, quienes han asistido y confiado en 
el equipo de autores de este documento.

MENSAJE DE 
AUTORIDADES
La Organización Meteorológica Mundial expresa su reconocimiento a las instituciones 
guatemaltecas que, orientadas por el liderazgo del INSIVUMEH, han logrado avanzar 
en este primer paso para la implementación del MNSC. Los grandes desafíos actuales, 
así como la coyuntura social y económica de la región y el país, demandan la 
integración sistemática de esfuerzos que permitan optimizar las múltiples capacidades 
institucionales en cada uno de los componentes de la cadena de valor para la 
provisión de servicios climáticos. Este esfuerzo nacional constituye un empeño único 
de adaptación transformativa para enfrentar el cambio y la variabilidad climática y 
construir resiliencia. Se reitera nuestro compromiso para acompañar al Gobierno de 
Guatemala en la implementación total del MNSC.

Capacidades de los servicios climáticos en Guatemala El Instituto Nacional de Sismología, Vulcanología, Meteorología e Hidrología (INSIVUMEH) es 
una institución técnico-científica cuya misión es generar y difundir información que permita 
tomar mejores decisiones en las diferentes áreas del país, con el objetivo de garantizar que la 
información sea accesible y permita desarrollar estrategias de adaptación al cambio climático 
y fortalecer a los diversos sectores socioeconómicos.
El INSIVUMEH, en su papel de Servicio Meteorológico e Hidrológico Nacional (SMHN), se 
encuentra suscrito a la Organización Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) que, durante la Tercera 
Conferencia Mundial sobre el Clima, propuso la implementación del Marco Mundial para los 
Servicios Climáticos que tiene concatenación de objetivos con el INSIVUMEH.
La importancia a nivel mundial consiste en equipar a las instancias que toman decisiones en 
los diferentes campos socioeconómicos sensibles a los fenómenos meteorológicos y climáti-
cos para hacer uso eficaz de la información climática. En consecuencia, no solamente hay una 
necesidad urgente de reforzar la cooperación mundial para la elaboración de datos exactos y 
oportunos, sino también de intercambiar los mismos entre proveedores y usuarios de los ser-
vicios. Es necesario que los países se unan en un esfuerzo conjunto para mejorar la gestión de 
riesgos derivados de la variabilidad climática y el cambio climático mediante la incorporación 
de información sustentada científicamente en la planificación política, económica y de cada 
uno de los ejes sectoriales del país.
La visión de las autoridades del INSIVUMEH es brindar información confiable, efectiva y de 
calidad, que impacte positivamente a la población. 
Se invita a las instituciones de los diferentes sectores del país a participar en esta iniciativa 
que lleva por nombre el Marco Nacional para los Servicios Climáticos y que está orientada al 
cumplimiento con los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible (ODS), los compromisos con Nacio-
nes Unidas (NDC) y el Plan K´atun.
En el ejercicio de mis funciones, entregamos a los usuarios de los servicios y de la información 
climática de Guatemala, el primer producto para la implementación del Marco Nacional para 
los Servicios Climáticos, para contribuir a las metas institucionales planteadas, garantizando 
que los productos generados den sostenibilidad a la actividad productiva de los diferentes 
sectores y gestionar de forma preventiva la reducción de la vulnerabilidad ante fenómenos 
naturales.

Universidad Rafael Lanvídar
La Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Proyección (VRIP) es la dependencia de la Univer-
sidad Rafael Landívar (URL) encargada de definir y concretar la visión universitaria respecto de la investigación y la proyección, en búsqueda de una mayor y óptima sin-tonía con los procesos de educación formal e informal y de acción pública. Entre las unidades que conforman la VRIP se encuentra el Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias Naturales y Tecnología (Iarna), el cual cuenta con capacidades humanas, físicas,  finan-cieras y de información que le permiten desplegar su labor con sentido programático y con mirada de largo plazo. 
Dentro de los mecanismos que le dan soporte a la labor de investigación, educación y 
proyección del Iarna, destaca el Observatorio de Territorio y Clima (OTC). Esta inicia-tiva universitaria también se ha visto impulsada por el proyecto «Fortalecimiento de la resiliencia de los medios de vida ante el cambio climático en las cuencas altas del altiplano de Guatemala» auspiciado por el Fondo Verde del Clima bajo el liderazgo de la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (UICN).
El OTC ofrece soporte científico y tecnológico al objetivo de contribuir a la reducción 
de la vulnerabilidad de las personas y comunidades asociada a los sistemas de produc-ción agropecuaria, los recursos naturales y, en general, a la estabilidad de los medios de vida, frente a las amenazas derivadas de la variabilidad y el cambio climático. En este contexto, el OTC opera como un mecanismo de gestión de riesgo agroclimáti-co, dando seguimiento, analizando y haciendo síntesis rigurosas de fenómenos socio naturales, atendiendo a las escalas espaciales y temporales que los definen. Este pro-ceder se hace factible a partir de: (i) información climática e hidrológica histórica, (ii) pronósticos actualizados, (iii) conocimiento (científico y ancestral) sobre los cultivos, los sistemas productivos, las amenazas hidro climáticas y (iv) la interacción activa y adaptativa con los actores locales.  
Es bajo estas premisas y pautas de operación, que la URL-VRIP —a través del Iarna y 
el OTC— impulsa esfuerzos colaborativos concretos en el seno del Marco Nacional de los Servicios Climáticos (MNSC) que lidera el Instituto Nacional de Sismología, Vulca-nología, Meteorología e Hidrología (INSIVUMEH). El Iarna y el OTC, en consecuencia, dinamizan, desde los modos de proceder universitario, estas redes de trabajo colec-tivo, procurando gestionar el riesgo de manera rigurosa, en favor de las personas, las comunidades y los entornos donde desarrollan sus vidas.

 Implementación del Marco Nacional de Servicios Climáticos (MNSC), paso 111
Guatemala se encuentra suscrita a marcos 
y convenios nacionales e internacionales en 
materia de acciones de mitigación y adap-
tación al cambio climático y de la gestión 
del riesgo de desastres. Por lo tanto, es ne-
cesario recopilar el contenido de los servi-
cios climáticos y de las partes interesadas 
en el país; ello, con el fin de evaluar las ca-
pacidades de Guatemala en la prestación de 
los servicios climáticos, para reducir los pe-
ligros y maximizar potenciales oportunida-
des conectadas con el tiempo, el clima y el 
agua (Organización Meteorológica Mundial 
[OMM], 2017).
Este documento aporta una visión general 
sobre los avances para la creación del Marco 
Nacional de Servicios Climáticos (MNSC) en 
Guatemala. El marco analítico utilizado se 
basa en el texto Directrices detalladas para 
la creación de un marco nacional para los 
servicios climáticos (Organización Meteoro-
lógica Mundial y Global Framework for Cli-
mate Services [OMM, GFCS], 2018). Como 
resultado, en este material se documenta 
el proceso para dar cumplimiento al primer 
paso para la creación del MNSC en el país, 
para lo cual se llevó a cabo lo siguiente: 
1. Identificación de los actores involucra-
dos en la cadena de los servicios climáti-
cos: proveedores, investigadores y usua-
rios.
2. Documentación y sistematización de la 
información de fuentes oficiales nacio-
nales e internacionales. 
3. Resultados del taller interinstitucional 
acerca de las Capacidades de los Ser-
vicios Climáticos en Guatemala. La con-
vocatoria de participación fue dirigida a instituciones y a los sectores involucra-
dos en este contexto del MNSC. La diná-
mica del taller permitió obtener impor-
tantes aportes de los representantes de 
las entidades participantes.
4. Realización del foro sobre Servicios Cli-
máticos en Guatemala. El objetivo prin-
cipal de la actividad fue presentar los 
resultados obtenidos en el taller Capa-
cidades de los Servicios Climáticos en 
Guatemala, donde se tuvo amplia par-
ticipación interinstitucional relacionada 
con estos servicios; entre cuyos princi-
pales logros destacan: las nuevas formas 
de generar pronósticos meteorológicos 
y climáticos en Guatemala, la innovación 
en sistemas de monitoreo, la creación de 
la Academia Nacional de los Servicios 
Climáticos para el fortalecimiento de las 
capacidades de acción en cambio climá-
tico de los actores de los sectores pro-
ductivos del país, la implementación de 
las mesas técnicas agroclimáticas (MTA) 
en beneficio del ámbito agropecuario, 
investigaciones sobre los servicios cli-
máticos y el clima en curso, así como los 
planes de estudio de los servicios climá-
ticos en formación para los servicios de 
extensión nacionales.
Los resultados obtenidos permiten identifi-
car las capacidades para gestionar la infor-

Capacidades de los servicios climáticos en Guatemala Guatemala is subscribed to national and 
international frameworks and agreements 
on climate change mitigation and adaptation 
actions and disaster risk management, 
led by institutions that manage climate 
information to different actors and civil 
society. Therefore, it is necessary to collect 
information around climate services and 
stakeholders at the national scale, in order 
to assess the country’s capacities in relation 
to climate services, to reduce risks and 
maximize potential opportunities related to 
weather, climate and water (WMO, 2017).

Livestock production supports economic growth, jobs and nutrition,  
but contributes to and is vulnerable to climate change. A transition is thus 
needed for livestock systems to become more sustainable and climate resilient, with clear positive effects on the Sustainable Development Goals. It is unclear, however, where the global community should invest to support this change. We identified priority geographies for livestock system investments in 132 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), at mid- and low latitudes. Our results show that adaptation and mitigation goals are inextricably linked for the vast majority of these countries. An equal weighting of adaptation and mitigation indicators suggests that the top five investment priorities are India, Brazil, China, Pakistan and Sudan. Across LMICs, these act as critical control points for the livestock sector’s interactions with the climate system, land and livelihoods.
Livestock production supports society and generates nearly 40% of 
global agricultural gross domestic product (GDP). About 1.3 billion  
people1, including almost 930 million poor Africans and South  
Asians2, depend on it for their livelihoods. Many rely on livestock as 
the primary source of revenue, and keeping livestock can also act as 
insurance, offering some protection when other income streams fail1. 
An important economic asset, livestock symbolize wealth and status 
across the Global South3. Through the provision of draught power 
and manure and the recycling of agricultural byproducts, livestock 
underpin crop production and the food system3–5. Animal-sourced 
food also provides nutrient-dense diets that contribute to cognitive 
development, growth and well-being6. Thus, livestock positively affect 
economics, health and cultural development, all of which are pillars 
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among others, the live -
stock sector has substantial potential to contribute to SDG 8.4 (on 
decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation), SDG 
12.1 (on sustainable consumption and production patterns), SDG 13.1 (on strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity), SDG 13.2 (on the 
integration of climate change measures in national policies) and SDG 13.b (on promoting mechanisms for raising the capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management).
Climate change seriously threatens livestock productivity and 
those who depend on it. More frequent extreme weather events, irregu -
lar precipitation and rising temperatures decrease yields and product 
quality, increase pest and disease outbreaks, increase mortality, cause 
price shocks and disrupt supply, with cascading effects on produc -
ers and consumers7,8. For example, without adaptation, by 2100, the 
impact of heat stress on cattle alone will probably reach 4–10% of the 
2005 production value9. Global estimates can, however, mask large 
regional differences. Reduction in milk and meat production in African 
and Asian countries may exceed 50 or even 70% under high-emission 
scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 585) by 21009. Despite 
uncertainties in the impact projections9, the risk is substantial10,11. An

Results
Exposure to climate hazards and emissions by geographies
We found that substantial livestock production value and rural popula -
tion are exposed to climate hazards (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). Across the 132 
countries in this analysis, US$660 billion in VOP, 1.04 billion people, 
470 million tropical livestock units (TLUs) and 671 million hectares of 
pasture are exposed to climate hazards (Table 1  and Supplementary 
Table 1). The most prevalent hazard combinations by percentage of 
total area were rainfall variability plus heat stress plus drought (33%), 
heat stress (28%) and rainfall variability plus heat stress (12%) (Fig. 1  and 
Supplementary Fig. 1). The levels of importance of the various climate 
hazards differ among countries and livestock production systems (Fig. 1  
and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Livestock systems in India, Nigeria 
and Sudan are the most exposed, with India’s exposure exceeding that 
of other countries at least fivefold (Fig. 1). Within the study area, rainfed 
arid and humid regions where mixed farming (crops and livestock) 
systems are prevalent had the highest VOPs (US$405 billion), rural 
populations (661 million) and TLUs (295 million) exposed to climate 
hazards (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Regions such as the Horn 
of Africa, which predominantly includes rainfed arid rangelands, and 
West Africa (with both humid and arid conditions) have 14% of their 
VOP, 28% of their rural population, 39% of their pasture area and 32% 
of their TLUs exposed to climate hazards.
GHG emissions from livestock are substantial across the study 
region. Across the 132 countries included in this analysis, emissions were 
estimated to be 2,995 megatons (CO2e) (Table 1 , Fig. 1  and Supplemen -
tary Table 2). Seventy-one percent (2,132 megatons CO2e) were directly 
from livestock production, including enteric emissions, manure and 
feeds, while 29% (863 megatons CO2e) related to deforestation for 
pastures and soy production (Table 1  and Supplementary Table 2).  
Mixed rainfed systems in humid and arid lands produce the most car-
bon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) by far, with ruminants representing 
66 and 94% of their total emissions (Supplementary Fig. 3). Emissions 
from Brazil and India far exceed those of the other countries studied, 
but these emissions result from vastly different dynamics. In Brazil, 
64% of total emissions are due to soybean and pasture-driven forest 
loss. In India, 99% of the emissions are from ruminants, predominantly  
from bovine milk production associated with mixed systems  
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
Priorities for adaptation and mitigation
Our analysis shows that no country or system with appreciable livestock 
production value and population has zero exposure to climate hazards 
or zero emissions (Fig. 1 ). Therefore, using this analysis to obtain a set 
of geographic priorities requires the identification of target outcomes, 
their relative importance and the implied trade-offs across scales. An 
equal weighting of adaptation and mitigation indicators (see Methods) 
suggests that the top five investment priorities are India, Brazil, China, 
Pakistan and Sudan (Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Across 
LMICs, these act as critical control points for the livestock sector’s 
interactions with the climate system, land and livelihoods. These five countries combined account for 46% of the total VOP, 35% of the total 
rural population exposed to climate hazards and 51% of emissions. 
However, differential weighting indicators change the outcomes of 
investment prioritization. For example, a sole focus on mitigation 
prioritizes investments in Brazil, China, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh 
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 7). In contrast, focusing only on adapta -
tion prioritizes India, Sudan, South Africa, Nigeria and Chad (Fig. 2  and 
Supplementary Fig. 8).that US$994 billion per year in livestock value—around 55% of the total 
value of production (VOP) for five commodities—is exposed to various 
climate hazards, especially rainfall variability (US$198 billion) and heat 
stress (US$130 billion)12. Adaptation of livestock production systems is 
imperative to maintain and enhance the benefits they provide.
These benefits, however, must be considered alongside the 
negative impacts of livestock on the climate system. Feed produc -
tion, enteric emissions, manure management, grazing and land-use 
change release methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere. Livestock production accounts for about 5.8% of global annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and about 31.5% of the food 
systems’ contribution1,13,14. The dominant livestock emission source 
varies by region. Herd size and enteric emissions drive climate impacts, 
for example, in rangeland systems15, while land-use change has an 
influence in mixed grazing systems. The expansion of livestock pro -
duction systems also threatens tropical forests16. Given the impacts, 
actions to decrease agricultural emissions need to target livestock 
production systems.
The livestock sector affects 10 of 17 SDGs, but not all in positive 
ways17, meaning that the meeting of global goals will require transi -
tioning to climate-resilient and low-emissions livestock production 
systems18. Yet, while nearly 100 countries prioritize livestock in their 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), public and private inves -
tors hesitate to target the livestock sector due to perceived risks and 
environmental concerns. Critical questions remain largely unanswered 
on where and in what to invest. In this study, we quantify countries and Box 1
Key concepts and terms on 
climate change adaptation  
and mitigation
Adaptation: Actions that decrease the vulnerability of farming 
systems to climate change (for example, farmers implementing water management systems to adapt to short- and long-term rainfall variations).
Adaptive capacity: Skills and capacity, such as knowledge, finance 
and technical capacity, that permit farmers or institutions to adjust their behaviour to mitigate the impact of climate hazards or capture opportunities.
Exposure: The degree to which a system is subject to a  
climate hazard.Hazard: A climate event or process that can harm farmers, such as 
loss in productivity—a function of exposure and sensitivity.
Impact: Hazards’ effect on farming systems and farmers, such as 
loss in productivity—a function of exposure and sensitivity.
Mitigation: Actions that decrease the rate of climate change  
by limiting or preventing GHG emissions and by enhancing 
activities that remove them from the atmosphere (for example, decreasing herd size to decrease their proportion of national  
and global GHG emissions).
Risk: The combination of exposure and vulnerability to hazards  
(the potential for adverse consequences).

Fig. 1 | Adaptation and mitigation potential priorities. Adaptation priorities 
include areas where TLUs (L), pasture area (P), rural population (R) and VOP (V) are exposed to climate hazards. Mitigation priorities include reducing livestock-direct and deforestation-linked GHG emissions (E). The bottom-left (top-right) 
corner of the colour scale indicates low (high) adaptation and mitigation potential 
priorities. Shades of blue show increasing mitigation potential, moving from light to dark blue, over the x   axis of the colour scale, whereas shades of green show 
increasing adaptation potential, moving from light to dark green, over the y   axis of the colour scale. The climate hazards include climate variability (RF), heat stress (THI), drought (D) and flooding (F). The following ID codes for the various indicators, hazards and emissions categories reference datasets used in the analysis (see Supplementary Table 3): TLUs (001), VOP (002), pasture area (003), 
rural population (004), climate hazards (006–009), GHG emissions (011–017), 
bovine emissions (011 and 012), forest loss to pasture emissions (013–016), forest loss to soy emissions (013–015 and 017), pig emissions (011 and 012) and shoat emissions (011 and 012).

Analysis https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01161-1For most geographies, it is virtually impossible to disentangle the 
importance and relationship between adaptation and mitigation. More 
specifically, adaptation and mitigation emerge as joint priorities most 
clearly in India, in which 32% of the rural population and 41% of the VOP 
in the study area are exposed to climate hazards, and which produces 
13% of the emissions (Fig. 1 ). Across most of Sub-Saharan Africa, adap -
tation measures tend to greatly outweigh those of mitigation options 
(Fig. 1). The converse is true for countries in Latin America, where 
mitigation concerns are generally greater than adaptation concerns.
Climate actions and their adoption constraints
Adaptation and mitigation options already exist that would allow the 
livestock sector to meet its economic, environmental and climate 
mitigation and resilience goals (Fig. 3 ). Among other factors, low 
investment, lack of education and cultural, institutional and political 
barriers have led to generally low adoption rates for these actions. Constraints to the adoption vary by region, country and options  
(Fig. 3). For instance, for the selected countries, cost is a barrier to 
adopting most options, and the relative importance of cost varies 
between 20 and 50%. In countries such as Argentina, Brazil and China, 
the main barrier to adopting a technology is the limited labour force due 
to the lower rural population and fewer people employed in agriculture. 
This barrier differs in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Sudan, where accessibility 
and knowledge are the main adoption constraints.
Discussion
From a global perspective, the weighting of adaptation and mitigation 
indicators highlights the geographies with the greatest problems, providing a regional focus. At local scales, however, these indica
-
tors emerge from farmers’ decisions on system management and, as 
such, are interconnected; any choice of adaptive or mitigating pri -
orities needs understanding of the trade-offs that impact other goals. IndiaNiger ia

Analysis https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01161-1Adopting a livestock practice or technology nearly always involves 
trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation outcomes19. Thus, to 
avoid unintended consequences, actions need to be aligned with local 
demands and goals. The consideration that adaptation and mitigation 
need to be addressed jointly is especially important in areas where 
population growth and/or dietary change are most prominent20. Yet, a 
lack of alignment at the policy level potentially hinders this objective. 
Roughly 50% of the NDCs that mention livestock note just one of the 
priorities21, and only 28 out of 184 countries’ NDCs include soil-related 
targets22. This omittance suggests that, as a global community, we are 
creating institutions and narratives that disincentivize or preclude 
action on adaptation, mitigation or both.
Our assessment of adaptation and mitigation options suggests 
that careful consideration of context specificities is needed for the 
scaling of options due to regional systems dynamics and adoption 
constraints (Fig. 3 ). In livestock systems in general, to maximize the 
benefits of improving and intensifying diets, reductions in herd size 
are necessary15–17. However, reductions in animal numbers may be 
limited to: (1) humid and temperate mixed systems where feeding grain 
concentrates are a plausible option23; (2) places where an alternative 
source of both feed and food protein are available15,23 ,24; and (3) where 
livestock are not enmeshed in cultural identity25,26. Manure manage -
ment is another viable strategy for decreasing emissions, but its appli-
cability is limited for open grazing systems. In the study region, 18% of 
cattle, 27% of sheep and 43% of goats roam in extensive grazing systems, 
where most excretion happens in the field; collection occurs after the 
manure is dry, if at all15,27. In East Asian systems with a high concentra-
tion of animals, emissions are associated with unregulated manure 
disposal, and animals produce more manure than can be recycled in 
the agricultural area28. In grasslands and agricultural land, 47% of the 
total potential mitigation arises from soil organic carbon protection 
and sequestration29, as well as the restoration of degraded rangelands23. 
The potential of restoration and improved land management actions to 
increase carbon storage and/or avoid emissions across global forests,  
wetlands, grasslands and agricultural lands is 23.8 GtCO2e yr−1  
(ref. 30). Silvopastoral systems are a viable land management strategy 
for adaptation and mitigation in Latin America, where livestock is a 
major driver of deforestation and 11% of people are exposed to heat 
stress. Silvopastoral systems could increase productivity31,32, decrease 
GHG emissions33, improve carbon storage potential32 and aid adapta-
tion to heat stress34. However, the scalability of silvopastoral systems 
has been limited by several factors: lack of knowledge, high initial 
investment requirements and the extended periods before returns 
on investments are seen.
Climate risk reduction should be essential in transforming live -
stock systems; according to our analysis, 69% of the VOP is exposed to 
high levels of climate variability. Climate services and access to credit 
and insurance are proven climate risk management actions that have demonstrated potential and scalability for crop-based systems
35,36. In 
Senegal, where virtually all livestock systems are exposed to high or 
extreme climate variability, climate services increase farmer income 
by 10–25%37. In the Horn of Africa, where pastoral drylands are regularly 
affected by drought and its interannual variability (Supplementary 
Figs. 1 and 2), the Predictive Livestock Early Warning System38 seeks to 
improve livestock herd management, migration patterns and livestock 
health through providing forecasts on water and pasture availability.  
Likewise, the index-based livestock insurance approach has sold 
around 90,000 insurance policies in Kenya and Ethiopia, positively 
impacting policyholders’ sales, income and well-being39,40.
Low levels of investment in the sector and a lack of effective poli-
cies, combined with high resource demand and limited information 
to implement solutions (Fig. 3 ), reinforce the gap between current 
livestock systems and their future potential. There is limited evidence 
regarding the scalability of the actions outlined here. As such, the set 
of interventions and practices that best protect against the combined hazards and can reliably measure their effectiveness warrants further 
investigation. The gathering of such evidence must be combined with 
building the capacities of local and regional organizations, the public 
sector and producers, to promote and implement adaptation options. 
Governments need technical support to access finance, implement pro -
grammes and report adaptation and mitigation achievements. These 
challenges apply equally to the private sector and small-scale systems. 
Large-scale production changes landscapes, and supply and demand shifts can provide major benefits and influence consumer behaviour. 
In small-scale systems, the value of livestock to livelihoods goes far 
beyond their productive capacity, and building local knowledge and 
capacity is vital to achieving transformation.
Methods
We used multiple spatial datasets (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) 
to implement a prioritization approach to identify priority geogra -
phies (that is, countries and production systems) for livestock system 
investments and to identify adoption constraints to adaptation and 
mitigation options. We selected two main challenges related to climate 
adaptation and mitigation strategies: (1) livestock production and 
producer livelihoods are threatened by short- and long-term rainfall 
and temperature variations and their changing predictability; and (2) livestock are responsible for a substantial proportion of national and 
global GHG emissions. A fully detailed description of the methods is 
provided in the Supplementary Information.
We used the livestock production system classification of  
Robinson et al.41. This classification divides livestock production sys-
tems into landless, rangeland and mixed systems. Mixed systems are 
divided into rainfed and irrigated, giving rise to four broad system 
categories (that is, landless, rangelands, mixed rainfed and mixed 
irrigated). Each category was then divided into agroecologies accord-
ing to temperature and whether they were humid, arid or hyperarid41. 
The study area included livestock production systems in all LMICs in 
mid- and low latitudes identified by The World Bank (n  = 132 countries).
Analysis of adaptation
We performed a geospatial data analysis to characterize livestock 
production systems and producer livelihoods and to identify threats 
related to short- and long-term variations in rainfall and temperature. 
First, we mapped regions projected to experience climatic hazards 
and masked them by their adaptive capacity within the livestock sys-
tems (Supplementary Fig. 8). Second, we assessed the exposure per 
hazard within each country and livestock system (Supplementary  
Fig. 9). Exposure was represented by the total VOP42, total rural popula -
tion43, pasture area44 and TLUs. TLU values were computed following 
Rothman-Ostrow et al.45 using data from the Gridded Livestock of 
the World database (version 3)46. VOP data were derived from ref. 42 , 
which used a combination of modelling and FAOSTAT data13 to produce 
geospatial datasets of the value of livestock production.
Sixteen climatic hazard classes were identified from the intersec -
tion of rainfall variability, heat stress, drought and flood risk. To charac -
terize rainfall variability, we used the coefficient of variation in annual 
mean rainfall (15–30% = highly variable; >30% = extremely variable) 
derived from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with 
Stations dataset47. Areas of heat stress were defined as having thermal 
stress (projected for 2030 under the Representative Concentration 
Pathway 8.5 scenario) with a of ≥79 (ref. 48 ). To define areas at risk of 
flooding, we used the UN Environment Programme–Division of Early 
Warning and Assessment–GRID-Europe dataset49, in which flooding risk 
is ranked from 0 (no risk) to 5 (extreme). Areas at risk of drought were defined as having more than 25 d without rain per month on average.
We defined three categories of livestock system adaptive capacity 
to these climate hazards (low ≥ 25%; medium = 10–25%; high ≤ 10%) 
using the national-level poverty headcount ratio of US$1.90 d−1 (ref. 50 ) 
as a proxy. For the exposure analysis, we considered areas with poverty

cient of variation, heat stress, flood hazard risk and drought).
Analysis of mitigation
We calculated total livestock emissions by geography by summing 
direct and estimated emissions from deforestation (Supplementary 
Figs. 10 and 11). We did not include changes in soil carbon stocks due 
to the difficulty in estimating these reliably at the scale of our study. 
Across the 132 countries included in this analysis, emissions were 
estimated to be 2,995 megatons (CO2e), which is lower than other 
recently published estimates51. This difference arises primarily due to 
the exclusion of direct CO2 emissions from cropland used for feed (see 
Supplementary Information) and the focus on LMICs only (compared 
with global estimates). Despite inherent limitations and uncertainties 
in the input datasets (see the corresponding references), our sources of 
emissions data are derived well-established sources (refs. 13 ,42,52,53) 
and robust for the purposes of our prioritization analysis. Furthermore, 
because our analysis does not introduce specific equations or param -
eters, it is unlikely that it introduces new uncertainties or propagates any original uncertainties present in the input datasets, beyond what would be a simple addition of these original uncertainties.
Direct emissions data come from ref. 42  and are for the year 2010. 
To update these data to 2019, we multiplied 2010 values by the pro -
portional increase in national livestock emissions between 2000 and 
2019, as reported by FAOSTAT13,54. To estimate livestock emissions 
linked to deforestation, we first combined above- and below-ground 
carbon biomass data from 201055 and masked these values by areas 
with tree cover values ≥30%56, giving a layer of carbon biomass per 
hectare of forest. Commodity-linked deforestation data are available 
for subnational administrative areas52. For each area, we calculated the 
average amount of carbon biomass (using the data from ref. 55 ) and 
multiplied this by the mean annual rate of commodity-linked (soy and 
pasture) forest loss for the period 2010–2015 (data from ref. 52 ) giving 
the average rate of carbon loss per area per year. Data from ref. 52  are 
available only at the subnational administration level; thus, our analysis 
of indirect emissions was conducted at that spatial scale. Carbon was 
converted to CO2 using a factor of 3.67 to account for its atomic weight. 
We assume that carbon in below-ground biomass is lost on conversion 
to pastureland or soybeans. We included deforestation due to soybeans 
as the majority of soybean production is used for livestock feed, but 
note that a proportion of this production has other fates.
Prioritization
All indicators were normalized by dividing the value of each indicator 
per country by the maximum value across geographies to rank coun -
tries and visualize adaptation and mitigation indicators (Fig. 1). For 
example, TLUs for each country were normalized using India’s TLUs, 
since it has the highest value worldwide. Each normalized exposure 
indicator was then weighted and summed, creating a unique adapta -
tion index. For the case of mitigation, each indicator corresponding 
to emissions was normalized by dividing by the maximum value 
across geographies.
Constraints for the adoption of climate actions
Based on a literature review57 and expert opinion, we identified adapta -
tion and mitigation options available for livestock systems (Fig. 3). To 
represent the constraints for the adoption of these options, we identi -
fied key global indicators reported by The World Bank to quantify the 
relevance of each constraint for each adaptation and mitigation option 
per country (that is, accessibility, cost, knowledge, labour and land 
tenure). We represented the constraints as follows: (1) accessibility was 
measured using research and development expenditure (percentage of GDP); (2) cost was measured by GDP per capita; (3) knowledge was 
measured by the total adult literature rate; (4) labour was measured by 
employment in agriculture; and (5) land tenure was measured by the Rule of Law (see Supplementary Table 4). The relative importance of each constraint for each option—not for a specific country but gener-
ally—was quantified based on expert opinion. We represent these con -
straints for the top three countries, by continent, that were identified in the prioritization analysis.
This research was conducted as part of a global research pro -
gramme on livestock and climate (see https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/

More recently, there has been an increase in the use of Multistakeholder Platforms (MSP) by several actors within CGIAR and beyond. Multistakeholder dialogues aim to ensure that there is a discussion on challenges facing communities within the different landscapes and how solutions are crafted to address the challenges through practical development interventions. This paper, firstly, engages with literature on MSPs and how gender equality and social inclusion can be made intentional by including women and youths in the processes. Secondly, through the practical implementation of the Aquatic Foods Initiative in Zambia, the actual assessments and practical implementation are being monitored and critiqued through the process documentation of MSP implementation to ensure that women and youths are included. The documentation goes beyond inclusion to document the outcomes of women and youth inclusion. Thirdly, this paper situates MSPs within the CGIAR’s MSPs’ broader community of practice to draw further common threads across different contexts, different resources and across different scales. The early findings demonstrate that it is possible to engage women and youths in the designing, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the MSPs. Such engagement needs to be intentional and must invest time and resources in ensuring that participation goes beyond attendance to informing and influencing the priorities and even going further to ensure those priorities are implemented and reflected upon.

CBBPs have been piloted for more than 14 years in Ethiopia, with both sheep and goats. Independent evaluations have indicated that CBBPs and related innovations have led to significant genetic gains, an increase in animal sales volume, improved consumption of animal products, women’s empowerment, capacity development, knowledge transfer at community level and enhanced household livelihoods.  Here we report the scaling of the CBBP model in Ethiopia from small ruminants to beef cattle, through the investment of a national partner, the Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute.

Seven alternatives (5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the total cow population) were considered for 20-year investment periods. In the current alternatives, the burden of record keeping in the dispersed villages, the effect of inbreeding, and the possibility of including the entire population in the improvement work were taken into consideration. Alternative breeding programs were simulated using ZPLAN software. Input parameters like population, biological, phenotypic standard deviation, costs, and economic values of objective traits were estimated. Pooled heritability and pooled phenotypic standard deviations were applied. A bio-economic model developed in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was used to estimate the economic weight of the traits of interest. Higher values of predicted genetic gains were observed for the breeding objective traits of age at first calving (AFC), lactation milk yield (LMY) and yearling weight (YW) with values ranging from −1.93 to −1.95, 1.13 to 1.14 and 1.30, respectively, and lower values for the calving interval (CI) and survival rate (SUR). Likewise, higher returns were observed for YW, AFC and LMY with values of (euro) 4.69–10.88, 4.08 to 9.47 and 2.66 to 6.17, respectively, and lower values were reported for CI and SUR. Positive and incremental total returns and profits were observed across the breeding unit size, with values ranging from 11.67 to 27.09 and 3.94 to 25.17, respectively. From a profit and total return point of view, the 100% breeding unit size was more attractive. However, with regard to annual monetary genetic gains, genetic merit for each objective trait, and the burden of record keeping, a 25% breeding unit size could be ideal.

At the same time, food systems contribute 25–30% of all greenhouse gas emissions. The livestock sector alone contributes about half of these GHGs, and has a large land and water footprint. The livestock sector is also the fastest growing agricultural sector in Africa and other parts of the Global South, where access to healthy, affordable milk, meat, and egg remains low. Clearly food system adaptation, including in the livestock sector, must deliver both mitigation and healthy diets. The CGIAR’s 2023 Achieving Agriculture Breakthrough report identifies seven key technological areas and approaches for driving real change in the agriculture sector. Three of these are related to livestock: reducing methane emissions from livestock, livestock breeding for climate resilience, and alternative proteins to replace traditional animal-source proteins. The third seminar of the CGIAR Policy Seminar Series on Strengthening Food Systems will delve into findings and recommendations around sustainable livestock technologies, healthy diets, methane emissions, and alternative proteins, including promising initiatives and technologies that can be pursued to address climate change and healthy diets.

To kick-start this Agenda, countries endorsed Breakthrough goals to make clean technologies and sustainable practices more affordable, accessible and attractive than their alternatives by 2030 in the power, road transport, steel, hydrogen and agriculture sectors. This report also covers the buildings and cement sectors, where new breakthroughs are being considered. The Breakthrough Agenda establishes an annual cycle to track developments towards these goals, identify where further co-ordinated international action is urgently needed to accelerate progress and then galvanise public and private international action behind these specific priorities in order to make these transitions quicker, cheaper and easier for all.

9The breakthrough objective for the food and agriculture sector is to make climate-
resilient, sustainable agriculture the most attractive and widely adopted option for 
farmers everywhere by 2030 (IEA, 2022). The world is 1.1°C warmer than pre-industrial 
times due to human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The effects of 
climate change are felt globally and are projected to worsen with further warming. 
The agrifood sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with losses and 
damages occurring throughout the value chain due to extreme weather events like 
high temperatures, droughts, and floods. Small-scale farmers in the Global South are 
especially at risk, and current efforts to adapt to climate change are not sufficient. 
To minimise the impacts of climate change, it is crucial to stay within the 1.5°C to 2°C 
temperature goals set by the Paris Agreement. Achieving this requires immediate and 
deep reductions in emissions across all sectors, including the agrifood sector, which 
accounts for almost one-third of all GHG emissions (IPCC, 2023c), within a broader 
framework of just transitions that safeguards the interests of smallholder producers, 
particularly those in the Global South who are most at risk.  
The agrifood sector requires transformative changes (or breakthroughs) to reduce 
emissions and ensure food and nutrition security without damaging natural resources 
while also making smallholder producers more climate-resilient. However, the 
sector’s inherent diversity makes technologies and approaches for reducing GHG 
emissions and building long-term climate resilience very context specific, which in 
turn requires careful analysis of trade-offs and synergies across various dimensions. 
A bundle of innovations in practices, technologies, policies and financing, across 
various subcomponents of the agricultural value chain, are needed to achieve these 
breakthrough objectives. We use the term technological areas and approaches 
throughout the report to describe these innovations in practices, technologies, policies 
and financing.  
The agriculture chapter of the 2022 Breakthrough Agenda Report (IEA, 2022) identified 
seven technological areas and approaches to achieve breakthroughs in the 
agriculture sector. This report provides a detailed analysis of these seven technological 
areas and approaches by documenting the latest scientific advancements in each 
one and evaluating how these fare across the four principles outlined in the 2022 
agriculture chapter. Additionally, this report considers the different geographical and 
socioeconomic contexts in which these four principles apply and accordingly qualifies 
them further. The modified principles proposed are:
•  Agricultural productivity and incomes in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) 
must increase sustainably, in order to achieve food and nutrition security and 
healthy and sustainable diets for all;  
•  The sector must reduce GHG emissions, and depending on technologies and 
approaches and geographies, these can be reductions in emissions intensity, or 
absolute emissions reductions, or both, with the ultimate aim of reducing absolute 
emissions; Executive summary
Page 10:
10•  Soil, water, biodiversity and natural ecosystems must be safeguarded across all 
geographies, including through a focus on healthy ecosystems; ; 
•  The sector must adapt and build resilience to climate change, including through 
approaches that promote inclusion and social safety nets for the poor and 
vulnerable small holder producers in the Global South.
 
In this report, we additionally chart these seven technological areas and approaches 
across five pathways. These pathways (interdependent with each other and with the 
four principles of the breakthrough mentioned above) are: 
1.  Reducing unsustainable consumption where such consumption has harmful 
effects on health, climate and the environment. Examples include (but are not 
limited to): alternative proteins to address high meat consumption in high-income 
countries (HICs); reducing the use of fertilisers and improving nitrogen use efficiency 
(NUE) in regions of excess application, by implementing precision fertilisation 
techniques as well as agroecological and other sustainable approaches; and the 
use of digital services to help reduce food waste in HICs where such losses are high.
2.  Increasing production of healthy and nutritious food without expanding agriculture 
into new lands and thereby preventing further deforestation. Examples include (but 
are not limited to): appropriate, efficient and low-emission fertilisation technologies 
in geographies where fertilisers are under-utilised; improving crop and livestock 
productivity and resilience to climatic shocks so that farmers improve their yields 
and incomes where these yields are low (e.g., in many LMICs); and digital services to 
reduce food loss, particularly in LMICs where post-harvest losses are high.
3.  Reducing damage to natural resources, such as soil, water and biodiversity. 
Examples include (but are not limited to): adoption of agroecological and other 
sustainable approaches for food production; appropriate use of fertilisers to reduce 
pollution due to leaching and run-off; various technologies and approaches, 
such as climate-smart livestock practices for reducing methane emissions from 
livestock, that also protect natural resources; and changes in dietary preferences, 
including alternative proteins that have a lower environmental footprint.
4.  Reducing emissions, either absolute emissions or emissions intensity, or a 
combination of both. Examples include (but are not limited to): the adoption of 
precision fertilisation technologies or low-emission fertilisers; the adoption of 
technologies and practices that improve livestock efficiency, particularly in LMICs; 
the adoption of alternative proteins to replace animal-source foods where they are 
overconsumed; and reducing food loss and waste at all stages of the agricultural 
value chains.
5.  Prioritising the needs and interests of smallholder farmers. Examples include (but 
are not limited to): providing digital and agricultural climate services (DACS) in the 
Global South for flood and drought early warning systems; adoption of technologies 
and approaches suitable for livestock production in the LMICs; or breeding climate-
resilient crops for smallholder producers in the Global South.  
Figure ES1 provides a conceptual diagram of the four Agriculture Breakthrough 
principles and five pathways for achieving them.

12The agriculture chapter in the 2022 Breakthrough Agenda Report (IEA, 2022) 
identified seven technological areas and approaches that can lead to agricultural 
breakthroughs. This examines each of these areas and offers insights on the current 
state of scientific development. It presents solutions that are ready to be implemented 
on a large scale, as well as technologies and approaches that require further research, 
development and demonstration (RD&D) before they can be upscaled. The agriculture 
chapter of the 2023 Breakthrough Agenda Report provides recommendations for 
international action and collaboration, and it should be read alongside this report as 
this provides the scientific basis for those recommendations.
The first breakthrough area is reducing emissions from chemical fertilisers. Fertiliser 
accounted for 10.6% of agricultural emissions and 2.1% of global GHG emissions in 2018. 
About a third of the emissions related to fertiliser occur during the fertiliser production 
process, while the remaining two-thirds of the emissions occur after field application 
(IPCC, 2019; Gao & Cabrera Serrenho, 2023). This report identifies six ways of reducing 
fertiliser-related emissions during field application and also ways of reducing 
emissions during fertiliser production processes (e.g., green ammonia).
 
The second breakthrough technology is alternative proteins. Animal-source foods 
(ASF) have a high carbon footprint, with livestock and fisheries accounting for 31% of 
food emissions (Poore & Nemecek, 2018). Livestock production also has a high land and 
water footprint (Vanham et al., 2023; Heinke et al., 2020) and is considered a leading 
cause of deforestation (Pendrill et al., 2022). Alternative proteins are a way to reduce 
consumption of ASF, particularly in HICs, where per capita consumption levels are 
much higher than global averages. Alternative proteins is a broad term that refers 
to any protein-rich foods and food products intended to replace those derived from 
traditional livestock sources, such as meat, eggs, dairy products and fish. This report 
identifies four types of alternative proteins and identifies barriers and options for their 
wider uptake.
The third technology area is food loss and waste (FLW). A lifecycle analysis of FLW from 
the food production and food consumption value chains found that FLW contributed 
9.3 billion metric tonnes (MT) of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions in 2017 (Zhu et al., 2023). 
FLW happens throughout the entire value chain and, according to some estimates, 
almost 30% of food that is produced never reaches consumers (FAO, 2023a), making 
it a relatively low-hanging fruit for intervention. This report identifies various ways of 
reducing FLW across the entire value chain.The breakthrough technologiesThis figure is not meant to be a comprehensive mapping of all seven techn ological areas and approaches across all five pathways, 
as objectives for many or most of them can be achieved through multiple pathways. 
The seven technological areas and approaches covered in this chapter are in bold. New technologies and approaches suggested 
for inclusion in future reports are in boxes with dotted lines. 
Page 13:
13The fourth technology area is breeding crops and livestock. Breeding crops and 
livestock that can withstand elevated heat, drought and other climate stresses can 
help farmers, particularly smallholder farmers in the LMICs, continue to produce food 
in a changing climate without expanding agricultural land. Crop varieties that use 
water or fertilisers more efficiently and livestock breeds that emit less methane can 
help reduce absolute emissions or relative emissions intensity. The report identifies 
advances in crop and livestock breeding for climate resilience, including various 
trade-offs for any possible negative impacts of improved breeds on animal health and 
disease susceptibility.
The fifth area of focus is reducing methane emissions from the livestock sector. Of the 
30% emissions from the livestock sector, about 88% come from enteric fermentation in 
the digestive tracts of ruminant animals (cattle, sheep and goats), released through 
belching, and the remainder come from manure (FAO, 2022a, c). This report provides a 
detailed analysis of scale-ready technologies for reducing emissions from both enteric 
fermentation and manure, and also lists the technologies that are not yet scale-ready 
but are at various stages of development.
The sixth area is that of agroecological and other sustainable approaches to 
agricultural production. Guided by a set of principles (e.g., recycling, maintaining 
biodiversity and enhancing knowledge co-creation), agroecology aims at favouring 
natural processes that improve resource efficiency, strengthen resilience and secure 
social equity, while offering both adaptation and mitigation co-benefits to climate risks. 
This report provides a menu of options for agroecological practices that are context 
specific and can be co-developed with local farmers and public and private sector 
actors.
The final technological area is digital services in agriculture, which can help farmers 
and small agricultural businesses rapidly gain the skills and knowledge they need to 
adapt to and mitigate climate change while improving food production sustainably, 
with practical applications in all the above-mentioned technological areas. The report 
details the various ways in which digital services help smallholder farmers adopt 
climate-resilient practices.
In the context of these seven technological areas, the report discusses scaling 
opportunities that require adapting proven technologies to local contexts, investments 
in local capacity, required inputs and infrastructure, and appropriate institutio","11332"

Adaptation Gap Report 2023: Underfinanced. Underprepared.Glossary 
The entries in this glossary are primarily taken or modified 
from definitions provided by reports published by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or 
previous editions of the Adaptation Gap Report. 
Adaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected 
climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks 
to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. 
In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate 
adjustment to expected climate and its effects (IPCC 20221).
Adaptation costs: Costs of planning, preparing for, facilitating and implementing adaptation measures, 
including transaction costs (IPCC 2007
2).
Adaptation gap: The difference between actually 
implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to tolerated 
climate change impacts and reflecting resource limitations 
and competing priorities (UNEP 2014
2).
Adaptation limits: The point at which an actor’s objectives 
(or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks 
through adaptive actions (IPCC 20221).
 ●Hard adaptation limit: No adaptive actions are 
possible to avoid intolerable risks.
 ●Soft adaptation limit: Options are currently 
not available to avoid intolerable risks through 
adaptive action.
Adaptive capacity:  T h e  a b i l i t y  o f  s y s t e m s ,  i n s t i t u t i o n s ,  
humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond 
to consequences (IPCC 2022
1).
Baseline:  The state against which change is measured. 
It might be a current baseline, in which case it represents 
observable, present-day conditions. It might also be a 
‘future baseline’, which is a projected future set of conditions 
excluding the driving factor of interest. Alternative 
interpretations of the reference conditions can give rise to 
multiple baselines (IPCC 20072).
Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species 
or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural 
assets in places and settings that could be adversely 
affected (IPCC 2022
1).Hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or human-
induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss 
to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, 
ecosystems and environmental resources (IPCC 2022
1).
Impacts: The consequences of realized risks on natural and 
human systems, where risks result from the interactions of climate-related hazards (including extreme weather 
and climate events), exposure and vulnerability. Impacts 
generally refer to effects on lives; livelihoods; health and 
well-being; ecosystems and species; economic, social and 
cultural assets; services (including ecosystem services); and 
infrastructure. Impacts may be referred to as consequences 
or outcomes and can be adverse or beneficial (IPCC 2022
1).
Loss and damage: There is no agreed definition for loss 
and damage. IPCC (20221) distinguishes between Loss and 
Damage (title case), which is used to refer to political debate 
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC), and losses and damages (sentence case), which is used to refer broadly to harm from (observed) impacts and (projected) risks and can be economic or non-
economic. In practice, loss and damage is most commonly 
understood as the adverse effects of climate change that 
are not or cannot be avoided by mitigation and adaptation 
efforts (van der Geest and Warner 2020
4).
Maladaptation: Actions that may lead to increased risk of 
adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased vulnerability to climate change, diminished welfare, or 
increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, now or 
in the future. Maladaptation is usually an unintended 
consequence (IPCC 2022
1).
Mitigation (of climate change): A human intervention to 
reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse 
gases (IPCC 20221).
Resilience: The capacity of social, economic and 
environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways 
that maintain their essential function, identity and structure. 
Resilience is a positive attribute when it maintains capacity 
for adaptation, learning and/or transformation (IPCC 2022
1).
Residual risk: The risk related to climate change impacts 
that remains following adaptation and mitigation efforts. 
Adaptation actions can redistribute risk and impacts, with 
increased risk and impacts in some areas or populations, 
and decreased risk and impacts in others (IPCC 20221).

VII
Adaptation Gap Report 2023: Underfinanced. Underprepared.Risk: The potential for consequences where something 
of value is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain, 
recognizing the diversity of values. In the context of climate 
change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions 
between climate-related hazards with the exposure and 
vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system to 
the hazards (IPCC 20145; IPCC 20221).
Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be 
adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety 
of concepts and elements including sensitivity or 
susceptibility to harm and the lack of capacity to cope and 
adapt (IPCC 20221).

Along with other women in Mangatsiotra village in Madagascar’s coastal 
Vatovavy Fitovinany region, Vivienne Rakotoarisoa uses a reed known 
locally as Rambo to weave together a mat to sell at a nearby market. Having 
previously relied heavily on rice farming - where harvests have been hampered 
by unpredictable rainfall in recent years - this climate-resilient crop is able to 
withstand periods of erratic rainfall, providing Vivienne and her family a more 
stable source of income in the face of a changing climate.

To help 43 communities in White Nile State, Sudan to adapt to climate change, 
a UNEP-led project has harnessed nature-based solutions to rehabilitate 3,792 
hectares of forests and rangelands and has helped 8,389 households have 
access to climate change-resilient food and water sources.

Adaptation Gap Report 2023: Underfinanced. Underprepared.In 2023, climate change yet again grew more disruptive 
and deadly. Temperature records toppled, globally and 
regionally. Storms, floods, heatwaves and wildfires caused 
devastation. These intensifying impacts tell us two things: 
the world must urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions and 
it must increase adaptation efforts to protect vulnerable 
populations. Neither is happening.
The  Adaptation Gap Report 2023: Underfinanced. 
Underprepared. Inadequate investment and planning on 
climate adaptation leaves world expose d finds that progress 
on adaptation is slowing across all three areas annually assessed – finance, planning and implementation – when it 
should be rapidly accelerating. This has massive implications 
for people left to face the full force of climate impacts without 
any shield and, as a result, for losses and damages – which are 
worldwide, but most forcefully felt in the developing countries 
least able to deal with them.
Based on a detailed update, the adaptation finance gap 
now stands at US$194–366 billion per year, with adaptation 
finance needs in developing countries likely to be 10–18 times 
as great as finance flows – over 50 per cent higher than the 
previous range estimate. At the same time, new adaptation 
projects are being added more slowly and the number of 
new national adaptation planning instruments is plateauing.
The new finance gap results from growing needs coupled 
with adaptation finance flows to developing countries 
declining 15 per cent in 2021 to around US$21 billion. 
Considering that the finance needed to implement domestic 
adaptation plans in developing countries is currently 
estimated at US$387 billion per year until 2030 – most of 
which will require international support to deliver – this is a 
hugely worrying deceleration. Neither the goal of doubling 2019 international finance flows to developing countries 
by 2025 nor a possible new collective quantified goal for 
2030 will significantly close the finance gap on their own. 
Therefore, finding new ways to deliver finance for adaptation 
action is essential. 
This report identifies seven ways to increase finance, 
including through domestic expenditure, international 
finance and the private sector. Additional avenues include 
remittances, increasing and tailoring finance to small and 
medium enterprises and a reform of the global financial 
architecture, as proposed by the Bridgetown Initiative 
– an action plan set forth by Barbadian Prime Minister 
Mia Mottley. The loss and damage fund will also need to 
move towards innovative financing mechanisms to reach

Adaptation Gap Report 2023: Underfinanced. Underprepared.XIIExecutive summary
Despite the clear signs of accelerating climate risks 
and impacts worldwide, the adaptation finance gap is 
widening and now stands at between US$194 billion 
and US$366 billion per year. Adaptation finance needs 
are 10–18 times as great as current international public 
adaptation finance flows – at least 50 per cent higher than 
previously estimated. 
This is the main conclusion of a comprehensive assessment 
of the literature and new analyses to provide updated 
estimates of the costs and needs of adaptation in developing 
countries, as well as the international finance flows required 
to address these needs. The report also provides updates 
on adaptation planning and implementation and concludes 
that global progress on adaptation is slowing rather than 
showing the urgently needed acceleration.
In view of ever-increasing weather extremes such as a 
multi-year drought in East Africa, flooding in China and 
Europe, and extreme heat and wildfires in the United States 
of America and Canada, among others, narrowing the 
adaptation finance gap is of particular importance because 
of the high benefits that investments in adaptation can offer 
in terms of reducing climate risks and improving equity and 
climate justice. Left unchecked however, increasing climate 
risks will inevitably lead to more climate-related losses 
and damages. Therefore, the Adaptation Gap Report 2023 
(AGR 2023) also focuses on loss and damage to support 
Parties in the negotiations following the decision at the 
twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (COP 27) in Sharm El-Sheikh to establish a loss 
and damage fund and funding arrangements for vulnerable 
developing countries.
Global temperatures and climate impacts and risks 
continue to rise, highlighting the urgent need for rapid acceleration of global adaptation action.
Current climate action is woefully inadequate to meet the 
temperature and adaptation goals of the Paris Agreement. 
While global average temperatures are already exceeding 
1.1°C above pre-industrial levels, current plans reflected in 
the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are putting 
us on a path towards 2.4°C–2.6°C by the end of the century. 
1 I n the absence of an agreed definition, potential adequacy and effectiveness of national adaptation planning processes are assessed through using 
comprehensiveness, inclusiveness, implementability, integration, and monitoring and evaluation as proxy metrics.Even if the rise in temperature eventually slows as a result of more ambitious collective climate change mitigation 
efforts, climate risks will accelerate with every fraction of a 
degree because of the compounding and cascading nature 
of climate-related impacts.
In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) concludes that residual climate risks – that is risks 
remaining after ambitious adaptation efforts – will persist 
even if the Paris Agreement goals are reached. Residual 
climate risks, in turn, will inevitably lead to both economic 
and non-economic losses and damages (figure ES.1). This 
demonstrates the importance of accelerating and scaling 
up both mitigation and adaptation action, to respectively 
avert catastrophic climate change and minimize the 
climate impacts that remain. In addition, more focus must 
be placed on anticipatory, just and effective adaptation 
action and support. 
One out of six countries still does not have a national 
adaptation planning instrument and more must be done to close the remaining gap. 
Five out of six Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have established 
at least one national adaptation plan, strategy or policy, 
and just under half of them have two or more national-
level instruments, which serve to replace or update 
the initial ones (figure ES.2). Moreover, 25 per cent of 
countries have put in place legal instruments that require 
national governments to plan for adaptation. There has 
also been significant improvement in certain aspects of 
the potential adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation 
planning1 since 2021. Both findings suggest a growing 
determination to address climate risks, but more needs to be done to ensure implementation of planning instruments. 
Meanwhile, 15 per cent of Parties still do not have a national 
adaptation planning instrument, and the rate of increase 
dropped from 4 per cent to 1 per cent in 2022. While half 
of the 29 countries without any such instrument are in the 
process of developing one, most of them are particularly 
vulnerable to climate impacts, and more must be done to 
support them to close the remaining gap faster.

Permanent link to cite or share this item https://hdl.handle.net/10568/135726 External link to download this item DOI Abstract/Description Milk consumption in Kenya is projected to rise. To meet projected demand in a sustainable manner, Kenya must focus on upscaling climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices to increase productivity. The Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Project has been supporting smallholder farmers to adopt integrated climate-smart Technology, Innovation and Management Practices (TIMPs). The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of these TIMPs on milk production and GHG emission intensity (EI; farm gate GHG emissions per unit of product). Survey data were collected from four counties in Kenya: Baringo, Bomet, Kericho and Laikipia. Emissions estimates were calculated for 566 farms using Agrecalc and data were analysed using multiple linear regressions accounting for variability in geographical context and production system (no graze, semi-intensive, and extensive). Mean daily milk yields ranged from 0.5 to 15.7 l/cow/day. EIs ranged from 0.6 to 12.0 kg CO2e/kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM), highlighting the opportunity for efficiency gains. The lowest EIs were found in Laikipia (2.4 kg CO2e/kg FPCM) and the highest in Bomet (3.1 kg CO2e/kg FPCM). This could be due to the difference in milk yields between counties and the prevalence of more extensive systems in Bomet. Dairy production system was the most important explanatory variable for the
variability in milk production and EI (P<0.001). County also had a significant effect on milk production (P<0.001) and EI (P=0.017). Increasing adoption of TIMPs led to increased milk production (P=0.068) and reduced EI (P=0.117). The largest gains in milk yield and reductions in EI were seen in extensive systems. While this was not significant, there was a strong visual trend in extensive systems, but not in intensive or semi-intensive systems. Our results show that adoption of TIMPs generally increased milk yields and decreased GHG EIs. Therefore, adoption of CSA practices could allow Kenya to increase milk production to meet projected demand, whilst keeping associated GHG emission increases below business as-usual predictions.

• While extensive systems faced higher CSA practice implementation costs 
due to lower milk yields, they also saw greater net value increases from 
enhanced milk production (Figure 1).  
 
• CSA practices boost net income in extensive systems regardless of the 
number used.  
• In intensive systems, only five or more CSA practices increased value.  
• Despite benefits for extensive farms, higher initial costs may deter CSA use.  
  
• Our study could not pinpoint which CSA practices were most effective due 
to farms using more than one.  
• Targeting extensive systems seems optimal for increasing milk production 
and reducing GHG EI.   
Livestock in Africa support many livelihoods but are significant greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emitters. There's a pressing need for cost -effective Climate Smart 
Agriculture (CSA) to reduce these emissions. This research evaluated the 
impact of CSA practices on milk yields and GHG emission intensities (EI) in 
Kenyan smallholder dairy farms and formulated a marginal abatement cost 
curve (MACC) to analyse economic costs and trade -offs in these systems.  Introduction  
• Data from 666 Kenyan dairy farms using 1 or more CSA practices (see list 
below) were collected across  four counties  
• Farms were categorised into three dairy production systems:  
 - no-graze, semi -intensive, and extensive.  
• Stakeholder workshops informed CSA practice costs.  
• Emissions were estimated using Agrecalc (Agricultural Resource Efficiency 
Calculator).  
• Multiple linear regression was used to assess the impact of the number of 
CSA practices on milk yield and GHG EIs  
• Costs per litre of milk were used to account for any milk yield increases.  Methods

• Our findings confirm that in Kenya, CSA practices boost milk yields and cut 
GHG EI in dairy systems. Yet, benefits varied across systems.  
• Targeting specific farms and using a ""toolbox"" strategy may be more 
effective than promoting a single solution.  
• More research is needed to understand the costs and benefits of different 
CSA practices in various systems  
• Policy and financing mechanisms are needed to facilitate implementation 
of CSA practices.  Conclusions

Results and discussion  
• CSA practices improved milk yields and reduced GHG EIs in dairy systems, 
but benefits varied (Table 1).  
 
• Only extensive systems showed clear statistical effects for improved milk 
yields and reduced GHG EIs, probably because intensive systems are near 
their peak yields.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is using CGIAR climate science to implement their Strategic Framework on Climate Action at HQ, regional and country level (https://reporting.unhcr.org/climate-action-focus-area-strategic-plan-20242030). Individual and compound climate hazards developed specifically for displacement are used in combination with UNHCR’s data on known locations of displaced and stateless people to inform the development and subsequent programming in 7 Regional Climate Action Plans across the globe, which will respectively lead to the development of a UNHCR Global Climate Strategy. This has the potential to support the efforts of 585 offices across the globe, influence policies in 135 countries where UNHCR is operational and shape advocacy on the nexus of climate change and displacement in donor meetings and policy fora such as COP28, the Task Force on Displacement and the Global Refugee Forum. In total, this partnership may potentially mitigate the vulnerability of the world’s 110 million displaced.

Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and preparedness are critical components of a comprehensive approach to managing and mitigating the impact of disasters. While anticipatory action (AA) interventions for monitoring socio-ecological risks are gaining prominence, the approaches and risk indicators differ considerably within and between climate, development, and humanitarian communities. There is also a fundamental variance in approaches and risk indicators relating to triggers and trigger components. This diversity underscores the need for a cohesive framework which addresses these disparities. Here we define a novel typology of fragility and risk indicators from a food, land and water system perspective, which supports the evolving nature of anticipatory action.

The Regional Climate Action Plan also builds upon partnerships and regional climate frameworks, such as the Regional Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (2023-2030) by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). This Strategy highlights the geographical differences and climatic vulnerabilities of the IGAD Member States (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda), and proposes key joint solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation. It also seeks to leverage work being undertaken with IGAD’s Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC)
to develop targeted climate adaptation measures for areas hosting forcibly displaced populations. The present plan was developed following a regional Theory of Change (ToC) workshop on Climate Change held in Nairobi in May 2023, and led by a Multifunctional Climate Team at the EHAGL Regional Bureau. The Plan was validated by technical focal points and sector leads at the Regional Bureau as well as climate focal points in country operations; and was finalized following consultations with key partners across the humanitarian-development-climate-security nexus.

For the 1.5 billion people living in fragile and conflict-affected situations,
livelihood challenges are compounded by climate change, unsustainable
resource consumption, poor governance, and weak social cohesion. Socio-
ecological risks have become increasingly prevalent due to climate change,
environmental degradation, and conflict. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and
preparedness are critical components of a comprehensive approach to
managing and mitigating the impact of disasters. Moreover, given the
disproportionate impact of conflicts and the differential vulnerabilities of
population groups to displacement, it is crucial to gain an in-depth
understanding of the dynamics of socio-ecological risks and implications for
resilience-building. Traditional approaches around socio-ecological risks
have been reactive, however policy makers and humanitarian stakeholders
have recognized the need to shift from a reactive to an anticipatory
approach which entails ex-ante, longer term planning. 
Monitoring these conflict, migration and fragility risks and informing early
action is crucial for preventing severe consequences and strengthening the
resilience of Food, Land and Water systems (FLWs). Indeed, various actors
such as Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and the UN are
implementing and discussing an array of Anticipatory action initiatives. While
early action interventions for monitoring socio-ecological risks are gaining
prominence the approaches and risk indicators differ considerably within
and between climate, development, and humanitarian communities. There is
also a fundamental variance in approaches and risk indicators relating to
triggers and trigger components. This diversity underscores the need for a
cohesive framework which addresses these disparities. This is essential in
devising a comprehensive anticipatory framework that assesses the multi-
dimensional nature of FLWs. 
To allow for precise communication and discourse among experts a
comprehensive understanding of early action initiatives undertaken by
humanitarian, climate, and development organizations is imperative. In this
context, a thorough review of fragility and risk indicators can serve as a
useful framework for understanding current monitoring and early action
practices related to fragility and risk. The review can then be used to identify
limitations and gaps existing in the current approaches which can ultimately
inform the development of a novel risk ‘typology’. Given the absence of
standardized indicators, methods and triggers for monitoring and
addressing socio-ecological risks, the ‘typology’ seeks to establish a new
approach that actors and organizations can employ to inform anticipatory
action. INTRODUCTION 
Improved fragility and risk indicators for Anticipatory Action in food, land and water systems 
Page 3:
Anticipatory action is a proactive approach aimed at reducing the impact of
impending crises by identifying, understanding, and addressing potential
risks before they escalate. This framework draws from insights provided by
the Anticipation Hub, an organization dedicated to advancing the
understanding and implementation of anticipatory action. The framework
not only defines anticipatory action but also outlines key interventions to
address gaps in indicators and trigger components for effective anticipation.
Anticipatory action involves the timely identification and response to
emerging risks or crises based on early warning indicators. It encompasses a
spectrum of activities, from risk analysis and scenario planning to the pre-
positioning of resources and the implementation of targeted interventions.
Anticipatory action seeks to enhance resilience and reduce the impact of
disasters, conflicts, or other crises by acting before the situation reaches a
critical stage. According to a recent report by the Anticipation Hub, there are
70 active anticipatory action frameworks in place in 35 countries and
another 97 frameworks under development in 2022 ( 1). While this is an
impressive number of frameworks, the diversity results in challenges
associated with mainstreaming anticipatory action across all levels of the
humanitarian ecosystem.

STATE OF THE ART
Enhancing the effectiveness of anticipatory action requires a nuanced
understanding of indicators that signal impending crises. With current global
challenges, the convergence of fragility, climate change and socio-ecological
risks pose a threat, particularly to vulnerable populations inhabiting conflict-
affected settings. As the urgency intensifies, international actors have begun
comprehensive assessments and frameworks to frame risk indicators and
triggers. These frameworks, while pivotal in shaping anticipatory action,
require critical evaluation to understand how risk is currently framed, and if
possible, this can be refined or even combined for a more holistic
understanding.
While triggers are recognized as crucial components in specific initiatives
and strategic plans, their widespread inclusion as a fundamental aspect of
global disaster risk reduction frameworks is still an area for further
development. These triggers, often defined as precursory indicators or
parameters signaling an imminent crisis or disaster, hold immense potential
when incorporated systematically into risk assessment and response
strategies. However, the four dimensions in which triggers are currently
framed are often limited to linear, static indicators, that have very little
cross-over to the other dimensions (Fig. 2). For example, hazards are often
individually defined, limiting their representation to singular hazards which
do not co-occur in space or time. Combined with the hazard level, timing is a
critical component which is constrained by forecast skill and lead times and
yet is the backbone of AA. In order to maximize trigger performance and
response, triggers should make use of hybrid components – incorporating
both predictive and observational data. The last two dimensions, the target
and activity, are arguably the most challenging to incorporate, yet
particularly important for effective intervention. Identifying and targeting the
most vulnerable households relies on baseline vulnerability data. However,
this data is rarely incorporated into the trigger, thereby limiting accuracy
and efficacy. Finally, if the previous three dimensions are integrated and
influenced by one-another, AA can identify the most impactful and relevant
activities such as cash, care kits or food, since these would be bound by the
compound hazards, timing, and livelihood focus.
In the pursuit of a more resilient and risk-informed future, the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction emerges as a cornerstone guiding
global efforts. By emphasizing the importance of understanding disaster risk
in all its dimensions, the framework advocates for an approach that
addresses the underlying connectedness and drivers of risk, including but
not limited to climate change, economic loss, and social vulnerabilities.
Improved fragility and risk indicators for Anticipatory Action in food, land and water systems 
Page 5:
The framework focuses on the adoption of measures which address
dimensions of disaster risk. Additionally, it prioritizes the enhancement of
access to and availability of multi-hazard early warning systems. The
framework outlines four primary priorities which include 1) Understanding
disaster risk 2) Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster
risk 3) Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience and 4) Enhancing
disaster preparedness for effective response and to “Build Back Better” in
recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.
Within the landscape of disaster risk reduction, the United Nations Office for
Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has also provided a Global Risk Assessment
Framework (GRAF). The GRAF provides invaluable insights into the complex
landscapes of hazards and vulnerabilities worldwide. Here they endeavor to
surpass conventional linear risk assessments, recognized as insufficient in
comprehending modern-day risks. Strengthening resilience necessitates a
shift from assessing and addressing hazards independently towards
acknowledging the systemic nature of risk where shocks frequently cascade
and compound in complex ways. The GRAF therefore aims to promote use of
scalable, systemic risk information to support planning. However, these
frameworks and data standards lack emphasis on triggers.
Triggers and trigger components serve as critical elements in the landscape
of anticipatory action, contributing significantly to the efficacy of early
warning systems and prompt response mechanisms. While comprehensive
assessments and frameworks are vital, the identification and utilization of
triggers play a pivotal role in initiating timely actions. Some existing
mechanisms prioritize trigger components, aligning with the core principles
of anticipatory action. For instance, initiatives like the Forecast-based
Financing (FbF) mechanism pioneered by the Red Cross Red Crescent
Movement emphasize trigger components derived from meteorological
forecasts and predictive models often from both local and global
meteorological institutes. FbF strategically links triggers to predetermined
actions, ensuring anticipatory measures are activated before disasters
escalate, thereby minimizing impacts on vulnerable communities.
In its 2023-2026 Strategic Plan, OCHA is also amplifying its commitment to
mainstream and expand anticipatory action following successful piloting
efforts. OCHA's implementation strategy involves the facilitation of
coordinated and collective anticipatory action approaches. This approach is
structured around three pivotal elements: first, a forecast-based trigger
integrated into a transparent decision-making process; second, pre-
established action plans designed to mitigate emergency impacts and
reduce the reliance on humanitarian relief efforts; and third, pre-arranged
financial mechanisms.

While not yet released, INFORM Warning aims to provide a comprehensive,
quantified, and accessible repository of multi-hazard early warning
information. The types of information that will be included are trends in risk
drivers and crisis severity, seasonal and cyclical risks and forecasts and
predictions. The platform aims to collate and synthesize this information to
show the changes of risk at country level over time, including aspects of
specific scenarios that could result in a crisis as well as basic information
about them- such as the primary drivers of risk as well as the timing, type,
and level of impacts. Users can then take the results and combine it with
other information to build complete early warning scenarios of impact
analysis. 
Addressing the multifaceted nature of triggers involves navigating various
challenges. One significant hurdle is the contextual relevance of triggers
across different regions and hazard profiles. What might serve as a reliable
trigger in one geographical location or for a specific type of disaster may not
hold the same predictive value elsewhere. This necessitates a dynamic
approach, accommodating local knowledge, socio-cultural nuances, and
specific vulnerabilities to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of trigger-
based systems. Collaborative efforts between local communities, national
agencies, and international organizations are instrumental in tailoring
trigger frameworks to diverse contexts, promoting inclusivity and accuracy in
anticipatory actions. 
The evolution of anticipatory action towards a more dynamic,
multidimensional indicator holds promise for revolutionizing disaster risk
reduction strategies worldwide. However, to realize its full potential,
concerted efforts are needed to embed triggers within the foundation of
global frameworks, ensuring adaptability and contextual relevance. In the
following sections we propose the framing of a novel risk ‘typology’, with a
focus on compound triggers. The evolving typology seeks to develop a
standardized yet flexible approach that empowers communities and
institutions to anticipate, response and mitigate risks effectively.

In order to improve the efficacy of AA, advances should focus on 1)
developing integrated social and environmental indicators or triggers that
are location specific, 2) implement continuous monitoring and evaluation
and 3) cross-sectoral collaboration (Fig. 3.).  
Contextual relevance of social and environmental indicators: 1.
Critical to the improvement of AA is the development of novel risks and
triggers that are context-specific, incorporating social and environmental
components that are relevant to the local population. AA needs to be multi-
indicator and regionally appropriate, this ensures that anticipatory action is
tailored to the unique vulnerabilities of each community. The indicators
should also be co-developed with communities to establish mechanisms for
ongoing community feedback to validate and adjust indicators. Cultural
practices, community behaviors and local knowledge play crucial roles in
identifying triggers. Incorporating traditional knowledge and community
perceptions into the indicator framework recognizes the importance of local
insights in anticipating crises. The indicator framework should also offer
flexibility to incorporate new triggers or adapt existing ones based on
changing environment, social or economic conditions. Figure 2: Dimensions of trigger development

     2. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:
Implement advanced data collection technologies, such as satellite imagery,
IoT devices, and social media analytics, to enable real-time monitoring of
indicators and disasters. This facilitates a more dynamic and responsive
anticipatory approach. Develop an iterative process for continuous
monitoring and evaluation, allowing anticipatory strategies to evolve based
on the changing nature of indicators. This adaptive approach ensures that
interventions remain effective in dynamic environments. The mechanism
would need to establish a feedback loop that captures lessons learned from
previous anticipatory actions. Analyze the outcomes of interventions to
refine indicator frameworks, promoting a culture of continuous improvement
in anticipatory strategies. Building upon hybrid triggers, sophisticated
predictive models and early warning systems should leverage continuous
monitoring and predictive analytics to anticipate potential crises. 
      3. Cross-Sectoral Collaboration:
Interdisciplinary research teams comprising experts from diverse fields
foster a holistic approach to indicator development. These teams can
collaboratively identify and refine indicators that capture the complexity of
emerging crises. Platforms such as the Anticipation Hub are well positioned
to facilitation knowledge exchange, dialogue, guidance and joint training
programs for professionals across sectors to enhance their understanding
of different indicators. Platforms such as this foster partnerships and
collaborative networks across borders, regions and subregions to share best
practices, data and expertise. A global collaboration amplifies the
effectiveness of anticipatory action, ensuring more coordinated and
impactful responses to multifaced crises that transcend individual
jurisdictions.
Merging hybrid trigger mechanisms ( 2), we propose a new risk and trigger
typology which is able to capture and represent multiple location-specific
indicators over a continuum of time (Fig. 3).

The occurrence of extreme weather hazards is increasing, with intensified
frequency and intensity, leading to significant impact on ecosystems and
human well-being ( 2 – 5). Beyond isolated hazards, the growing emergence of
high impact compound events requires immediate attention to minimize
further loss and damage ( 4 , 6 , 7). Here we propose a multi-dimensional
trigger which incorporates interconnected environmental and socioeconomic
crises, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable groups, including,
refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum seekers and stateless people.
In order to ensure contextual relevance and maximize application, this
framework was co-developed with UNHCR.
Compound events manifest through the interaction of hazards or drivers,
such as extreme heat and drought or strong winds and heavy precipitation.
The selection of climate triggers underwent a rigorous methodological
process aimed at identifying hazards significantly impacting the world most
vulnerable groups. This involved the co-development of climate impacts to
regions hosting vulnerable communities. The final selection of climate
triggers was three primary climatic threats—extreme heat, drought, and
flood—owing to their frequent occurrence and profound implications for
displaced individuals.

To synthesize these climate triggers into a unified composite index for each
location, we utilized a mathematical technique known as the Euclidean norm.
This methodology facilitates the integration of various triggers into a
cohesive metric, prioritizing the severity and co-occurrence of these
hazards. Unlike conventional averaging methods, the Euclidean norm
pinpoints the most substantial values across the different hazards. As a
result, it accentuates scenarios where a particular hazard holds notably
greater weight or where multiple hazards converge, ensuring the composite
index emphasizes the most intense or compound risks faced by displaced
populations. The Euclidean norm plays a pivotal role in crafting a composite
index devoid of biases towards any singular dominant trigger. Instead, it
highlights instances where multiple hazards intersect or where one hazard
significantly outweighs others. Furthermore, the approach was therefore
able to capture all relevant climate information along a time continuum for a
specific location.
Following the selection and synthesis of climate triggers, the analysis
incorporated critical livelihood indicators tailored to each location hosting
forcibly displaced populations. These livelihood indicators include aspects
such as crop health and community health status, over time. This
multifaceted approach therefore incorporates the intersecting
vulnerabilities of the target population linked to livelihood sustainability and
community well-being, beyond just hazards.
For each location, the composite index not only considers the intensity and
co-occurrence of climate-related hazards, but also cross-references these
with the impacts on local crops and health conditions. This approach allows
for a nuanced understanding of the compound risks faced by forcibly
displaced populations, acknowledging that a complete trigger event should
encompass both climatic threats and socio-economic vulnerabilities
associated with focus regions.
While this approach does enable a more comprehensive development of
triggers for AA, there are still numerous components which can be
improved. Firstly, the compound risks only incorporate a longer-term
horizon forecast, yet lack any observational component. Secondly, there are
multiple other hazards which could be included. Likewise, there are also
multiple socio-economic indicators which should be included to capture the
vulnerability component more accurately. Importantly, each of the socio-
economic indicators should also be localized with ground-based knowledge
in order for them to be effective. Consequently, this framework offers some
progressive steps and insights to improve proactive interventions in
anticipatory action.

CONCLUSION
Improving indicators in anticipatory action is a multifaceted challenge that
requires a combination of technological advancements, community
engagement, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By focusing on the
integration of social and environmental indicators, continuous monitoring
and evaluation, and cross-sectoral collaboration, the anticipatory action
framework can become more robust and responsive. This approach ensures
that indicators evolve with the changing nature of crises, leading to more
effective and timely anticipatory interventions.

EAST  AND  HORN OF AFRICA AND GREAT LAKES REGION |  CLIMATE ACTION PLAN | 2023 - 2028  
OVERVIEW  
The climate crisis is driving displacement and making life harder for those already forced to flee.  Protection 
and solutions  for displaced people are becoming more difficult  to achieve as climate change adds to degraded 
and dangerous conditions in areas of origin and refuge. Millions of refugees , internally  displaced and stateless 
people are living in climate “hotspots” , where they typically lack the resources to adapt to an increasingly 
inhospitable environment.  The East  and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes (EHAGL) Region is one of the most 
climate -vulnerable regions globally  and has seen t he number of forcibly displaced people in the  region  almost  
triple over the past decade . 
Forcibly displaced populations often live in areas that are expected to see the most drastic increases in climate 
hazards by 2030. To address the challenges  they face , UNHCR seeks  to form a coalition of partners across 
the hum anitarian -development -climate -security nexus , and leverage climate adaptation and resilience 
investments in support of areas host ing forcibly displaced populations. UNHCR will also strengthen its 
operations to meet the protection and assistance needs exacerbated by climate emergencies . Much of the 
work we do  in vulnerable humanitarian contexts , ranging from preparedness and response, cash -based 
assistance , durable shelter, and others,  contributes to the climate  resilience and adaptive capacities of 
displaced and host communities , but we need to do more . 
The key objectives of the 2023 -2028 UNHCR  EHAGL  Region  Climate Action Plan , which lists priority action 
points to better implement existing UNHCR  global climate  commitments , are the following:  
• Through increased legal, policy and normative engagement, states will improve their capacity to 
consistently provide protection to people fleeing from and living in climate  crises.  UNHCR will provide 
legal and policy advice, guidance, and support to national governments, regional economic  communities, 
and other relevant stakeholders, to develop enhanced protection for refugees and other people displaced 
in the context  of disasters and climate change.  
• Through expanded partnerships and scaled up financing,  displaced populations and their hosts will have  
increased access to environmentally sustainable resources and services.  We are committed to reducing 
environmental degr adation in displacement settings and enhancing the preparedness and resilience of 
displaced people and host communities.  We will continue to advocate for a scale up on adaptation 
financing and support to climate action in countries and host community areas  where displaced people 
take refuge or hope to safely return to.  
• Through inclusion into national plans and systems, forcibly displaced, stateless people and their hosts 
will have the economic and physical means to prepare for, survive and recover from climate shocks and 
stresses. UNHCR will advocate for the inclusion of refugees into regional and national climate change 
related policies and plans and striv e to improve the ir anticipatory and early warning capacit ies to better 
prepare for emergencies brought on by climate -related and other natural hazards.  
UNHCR will also continue its efforts to function with a significantly reduced carbon footprint and to ha ve the 
means and systems in place to minimize negative impacts on the environment . We seek  to reduce the carbon 
footprint of our own operations by implementing green solutions  to reduc e greenhouse gas emissions .

Introduction  
 
“Right now, i n our region, climate change  is amplifying  the risk of 
conflict and ultimately forcing already vulnerable  people to flee 
their homes . We need proactive and bold action , commitment,  
and dedication  from all actors  to protect communities , and to  find 
solutions  with and for those on the frontlines of the climate 
emergency. ” 
Mamadou Dian Balde  
Director , Regional Bureau for the East  and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes  
 
As a central component of the 2022 -2026 UNHCR Strategic Directions , UNHCR has globally identified eight focus areas that 
require renewed attention and accelerated effort . One of  these is climate action. In 202 1, UNHCR published its Strategic 
Framework for Climate Action  and, in 2022 , its Operational Strategy for Climate Resilience and Environmental Sustainability 
(2022 -2025 ).  
This Regional  Climate Action  Plan for the East and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes (EHAGL)1 outlines  a five-year vision and 
roadmap for the operationalization of the se two documents. It highlight s how UNHCR aims to accelerate results on climate 
action in  the EHAGL region , in line with the ambition of the  UNHCR Strategic Directions 2022 -2026  and its  Strategic Plan for 
Climate Action  2024 -2030 . 
The Regional Climate Action Plan also builds  upon partnerships and regional climate frameworks , such as the Regional 
Climate Change Strategy an d Action Plan (2023 -2030)  by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) . This  
Strategy highlights the  geographical differences and  climatic  vulnerabilit ies of the IGAD Member States ( Djibouti, Eritrea, 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan,  and Uganda) , and propos es key joint solutions for climate mitigation and 
adaptation. It also seeks to leverage  work being undertaken with  IGAD’s Climate Prediction and Applications Cent re (ICPAC) 
to develop targeted climate adaptation measures for areas hosting forcibly displaced populations.  
The present  plan was developed following a regional Theory of Change  (ToC)  workshop on Climate Change held in Nairobi 
in May 2023, and led by a Multifunctional Climate Team at the EHAGL Regional Bureau. The Plan was validated by technical 
focal points and sector leads at the Regional Bureau as well as climate focal points in country operations ; and was finalized 
following consultations with key partners  across the humanitarian -development -climate -security nexus.

Situation analysis  
 
Refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and stateless people are on the frontlines of the  climate  emergency. Many are 
living in climate “hotspots”, where they typically lack the resources to adapt to an increasingly hostile environment  and are 
therefore unable to live self -sufficient  and dignified lives . UNHCR is providing protection and assistance to many refugees and 
other people displaced by the effects of climate change, as well as helping them increase their resilience to future disaster s. 
By October 2023, the EHAGL  region hosted  a total of 1 9 million forcibly displaced individuals. Of these, more than  5.4 million 
were  refugees and asylum -seekers, meaning the region host ed one out of every six refugees globally. Over 1 3.6 million 
persons were  internally displaced.2 Of the latter, at least 2.1 million people were living in internal displacement by the end of 
2022 following the impacts of hazardous climate -related events or “disasters”, primarily floods and droughts .3 
A joint UNHCR -IGAD study, funded by the Migration  Multi -Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) on Human Mobility and Climate Change 
in the IGAD region4, show s that in the EHAGL region , climate change is a “risk multiplier” that is driving both displacement 
and deepening protection needs. It underscores that resilience to environmental degradation and climate -related disasters 
and displacement is often lowest in frag ile and conflict -affected contexts.  
A recent IMF paper on Climate Challenges in Fragile and Conflict -Affected States5 finds that climate vulnerability and 
underlying fragilities , namely conflict, heavy dependence on rainfed agriculture, and weak capacity and policy buffers , 
exacerbate each other, amplifying the negative impact on people and economies. Of the eleven countries covered by 
UNHCR’s EHAGL Regional  Bureau, six (Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan)  appear on the 2024 
list of fragile and conflict -affected situa tions (FY 24 FCS list) , released annually by the World Bank Group (WBG).  These  six 
countries host 47 per cent of all  refugees and asylum -seekers  in the region as well as  100 per cent of all IDPs . Meanwhile, as 
of 2022, approximately 4.8 millio n refugees and asylum -seekers, constituting 97 per  cent of the total population hosted in the 
region of  around  4.9 million, originate from fragile and conflict -affected states .6 
Many displaced populations  are frequently located in peripheral , rural,  or peri -urban locations  and rely on agropastoralism as 
their primary source of income . They  lack social safety nets that can assist with loans and support to diversify income sources.

Climate change, commonly referred to as a “threat multiplier” of pre-existing socioeconomic issues, already undermines rural livelihoods by reducing agricultural yields and income opportunities. This paper provides a review of climate-related migration in the CADC region while identifying the specific pathways by which climate change manifests itself as a threat multiplier to migration. Different forms of human mobility (seasonal/temporal/permanent and internal/international migration) are increasingly attempted as adaptation strategies by affected households to diversify incomes and offset climate impacts. Preferred intra-regional migrant destinations tend to be less climate-vulnerable and also less violent. Notably, climate change is not isolated from socioeconomic and political migration drivers. Erosion of rural livelihoods reduces the costs of engaging in illicit coping strategies (e.g., illegal crop production) and simultaneously favours rapid urbanisation, which is linked to (forced) gang recruitment, primarily affecting the youth. These processes contribute to extraordinarily high violence levels, which are a major push factor for migration on their own, ultimately challenging state authority. Moreover, as outmigration from the region is projected to increase, the observed securitisation of borders, particularly along the USA-Mexico border and the Mexico-Guatemala border, while unfit to limit migration attempts, make migration more desperate and dangerous, allowing organised crime to step in and exploit migration as an economic undertaking. Thus, for the CADC, the depoliticised and simplistic narrative of migration serving as adaptation must be questioned. Policy coherence and state capacity for addressing climate-security-migration nexus challenges are critical needs.

Guatemala is characterized by high rates of poverty and inequality, as well as a
significant incidence of violent acts and generalized social tension. Climate change
impacts on temperatures, rainfall patterns and extreme weather events are
deepening the challenges of marginalized populations regarding food security,
livelihood options, housing needs and access/availability of natural resources.
Domestic and international migration constitutes a common adaptative strategy for

to explore these complex interactions between climate, security and human
mobility in Guatemala. To acknowledge and conceptualize these interactions four
main pathways were identified: 
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        2
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Page 4:
Pathway 1: 
Conflict and human security risks as a result of climate-related migration. 
The impacts of climate change in Guatemala, mediated by socioeconomic
inequalities and institutional fragilities, affect negatively the availability and access
to natural resources, as well as food and livelihood insecurities. Migration is used
as a coping mechanism for individuals, households and communities seeking to flee
from these vulnerable contexts and find alternative livelihood opportunities.
Nevertheless, migrants are often exposed to human security risk during transit and
in destination areas. Similarly, human mobility patterns may produce conflict
escalation in origin and receiving areas. 
Pathway 2: 
Conflict and human security risks as a result of displacement produced by climate-
related and geophysical disasters. 
Guatemala is highly vulnerable to natural disasters such as tropical storms, floods,
mass movements and volcanic/seismic activity. Displacement produced by climate-
related and geophysical disasters can exacerbate human security risks and conflicts
in origin and receiving areas, as well as in IDPs transit routes. Shelters and urban
areas receiving displacement often suffer from poor infrastructure, lack of social
services and weak state presence, leading to socioeconomic vulnerabilities,
dynamics of violence and limited response strategies to natural hazards.  
 
Pathway 3: 
Compounding risks and vulnerabilities as a result of displacement produced by violence.
 
Violent displacement in Guatemala is the result of multiple factors including drug
trafficking activities, gangs' territorial expansion, weak state presence and land
grabbing dynamics produced by extractive economies. Domestic and gender-based
violence are also main drivers of displacement in the country. Displacement
produced by violence has strong negative consequences on climate adaptation and
resilience capacities, places of origin, transit and destination. IPDs are particularly
vulnerable to climate hazards in transit routes, temporary shelters, as well as rural
or urban destinations.   
 
Pathway 4: 
Immobility and trapped populations 
Human mobility, as a coping mechanism to endure climate vulnerabilities and
socioeconomic hardship, is not a feasible option for all individuals and households
in Guatemala. Victims of involuntary immobility, also known as trapped populations,
can be restricted by economic challenges, extreme climatic conditions and social
limitations, such as gendered duties and social norms. Trapped populations are
highly vulnerable to worse climatic and socioeconomic conditions, often leading to
compounding vulnerabilities, maladaptive initiatives, human security risks and
conflicts escalation.

Climate Exposure and Vulnerability  
 
Located within the tropics and with a mountainous relief, Guatemala experiences a
diverse climate. The western highlands of the country experiences colder
temperatures, whereas the northern region of Petén has tropical forests.
Additionally, Guatemala features humid coastal regions that contrast with the drier
weather experienced in the western region, along the Central American Dry
Corridor (MARN et al., 2021). Seasonal precipitation occurs from May to October
and is primarily characterized by a brief dry spell, known as the mid-summer
drought, where a reduction of about 40% in rainfall is experienced for a period
ranging from a few weeks to a month in July or August (Bardales et al., 2021; MARN
et al., 2021). 
 
Due to its high vulnerability and poor adaptative capacities to the effects of climate
change, Guatemala is regarded as a main hotspot for climate change (Notre Dame
University, 2022). Similarly, because of extreme weather and non-climate-related
natural hazards like earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcano eruptions, Guatemala is
considered one of the nations that is most susceptible in terms of climate
variability (IEP, 2021; MARN et al., 2021). The maximum and lowest daily
temperatures have increased by 0.8ºC and 0.6ºC, respectively, over the previous
twenty years, with increases most pronounced in February, July, August, and
September (MARN et al., 2021). The Pacific coast, Bocacosta, Valles de Oriente and
the Caribbean are the regions which have experienced the most temperature rises
(MARN et al., 2021). Rainfall patterns have changed dramatically over the past 20
years, with an increase of 122mm in the average annual rainfall and more intense
and sparsely spaced rainy days (MARN et al., 2021).  
 
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        4
CONTEXT
Page 6:
Temperatures are expected to rise between 2°C and 4°C by 2050, with the Pacific
coasts and semi-arid valleys experiencing the largest rises (García Morales, 2019;
MARN et al., 2021). In the semi-arid area of the country, located in the Dry Corridor,
climate projections expect a reduction in precipitation of up to 50% (Bardales et al.,
2021). Although fewer rainy days are predicted, major events like tropical cyclones
are anticipated to occur more frequently nationwide (Bardales et al., 2021).
According to climate projections, the mid-summer drought will start earlier and last
longer (+18 days), which will expand the semi-arid environment across more
regions (Maurer et al., 2017). It is anticipated that the departments of Baja Verapaz,
Sacatepéquez, Totonicapán, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, El Progreso, Zacapa,
Jutiapa, Chiquimula, as well as the north-western regions of Quiche and
Huehuetenango, will experience significant impacts on water availability (Bardales
et al., 2021). Municipalities situated in coastal-marine regions are expected to
exhibit a significant degree of vulnerability to climate change, ranging from “high” to
“very high” (NUSAID, 2017). This vulnerability stems mostly from the projected
increase in sea levels, estimated to elevate by approximately 9 to 13 cm by the year
2050, and inducing adverse consequences such as flooding and erosion (MARN et
al., 2021; USAID, 2017). 
Conflict and Fragility   
 
Guatemala has seen a recent history marked by instances of military coups, a
protracted civil war, the imposition of authoritarian rule, and a prevailing
atmosphere of instability and insecurity. The country exhibits a significant incidence
of homicides and violent crimes associated with gang activities and organized
crime, in which drug trafficking activities significantly contribute to the overall state
of insecurity (IEP, 2021; Nett & Rüttinger, 2016).   
 
Within the context of the Cold War era, Guatemala experienced a 36-years long civil
war (1960-1996). After the overthrow of the democratically elected president
Jacobo Arbenz in 1954, Guatemala witnessed a confrontation between conservative
and leftist factions, leading to revolutionary conflicts and subsequent government
repression (Álvarez Aragón et al., 2013; Molden, 2015). Between 1965 through to
the mid-1990s, Guatemala experienced an internal armed conflict characterized by
hostilities between the government forces and various insurgent factions, including
the FAR (Rebel Armed Forces), the EGP (Guerilla Army of the Poor), and the PGT
(Guatemalan Worker's Party) (UCDP, 2023). This period was marked by asymmetrical
acts of aggression, leading to the death and disappearance of an estimated 200,000
individuals, with about 83 percent belonging to indigenous Mayan tribes. It is for
this reason that the Commission for Historical Clarification has determined that
these communities endured a genocide (UCDP, 2023; ODHAG, 1998). 
In spite of the peace agreement, Guatemala is still struggling with persistent
violence in the aftermath of the civil war. This violence emanates from several
sources, including both state and non-state actors, including organized crime and
gang violence (Godoy, 2006; Knowlton, 2017; Rodgers & Muggah, 2009). Guatemala
is positioned along  the  drug  smuggling  route  between  South and North America  
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        5

and has experienced an escalation in violence associated with drug trafficking,
micro-trafficking, extortion, and money laundering activities (Del Mercado et al.,
2021; ICG, 2017; Nett & Rüttinger, 2016). Guatemala has some of the highest rates
of homicide within both Latin America and the global context, alongside a notable
prevalence of femicide rates (UNICEF, 2014; World Bank, 2021a). These elements
have played a significant role in the classification of Guatemala as the second most
perilous nation for individuals under the age of nineteen, (UNICEF, 2014). 
Socio-environmental conflicts have also been fueled by the emergence of new
economic activities, primarily extractive in nature (INTRAPAZ, 2009). Conflict
between local communities and transnational corporation-affiliated extractive
industries has been linked to large-scale investments, such as the development of
hydroelectric plants on the Northern Transversal Strip highway, the reactivation of
nickel mining in Izabal, and the cultivation of sugar cane in Polochic (INTRAPAZ,
2009; López et al., 2021). In addition, there are frequent disputes over access to
natural resources between social groups and communities. There is evidence of
both intra- and intercommunity conflict in Sololá, between Santa Catarina
Ixtahuacán and Nahualá municipalities, and in San Marcos, between Tajumulco and
Ixchiguán municipalities (ACLED, 2022; Garcia, 2022; Tejiendo Paz, 2020). Most of
areas with ongoing social conflicts are characterized by a historically high inequality
and insecure land tenure, reason why these tensions are viewed as continuations of
socioecomic conditions that fueled the civil war, even though they are not directly
related (López et al., 2021).   
Socio-economic Context  
Guatemala is classified as an upper middle-income country, with some of the
highest rates of poverty and inequality found in Latin America (World Bank, 2021b).
Agriculture continues to be one of the most significant economic sectors, with up to
31% of all employment (World Bank, 2021b). Up to 1.8 million jobs are produced by
the coffee industry alone (Canet Brenes et al., 2016). The agricultural sector is
particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, given that most agricultural
production is rainfed and that over 80% of agricultural-based GDP is generated in
regions at risk of disaster (Hernández, 2012; World Bank, 2011).   
 
The nation's rates of poverty and inequality are still alarmingly high. In the
departments located in the Dry Corridor, unemployment rates might reach 54%
(WFP et al., 2017). Guatemala has one of the highest 20 Gini values in the world and
is considered to be one of the most unequal nations in Latin America (World Bank,
2014). While 1% of Guatemalans own 40% of the nation's wealth (Oficina Económica
y Comercial de España en Guatemala, 2022), 49% of the country's population live
below the upper-middle income poverty line (World Bank, 2020), and 10% of its
people subsist on less than $2 USD per day (World Bank, 2014). Indigenous Peoples
experience a disproportionately high rate of poverty, with 79% of them living in
poverty (WFP, 2022). Since high levels of gender inequality restrict women's access
to land, resources, financial services, and employment prospects, women are
disproportionately affected by these vulnerabilities (Howland et al., 2021).   
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        6 
Page 8:
Guatemala experiences the triple burden of obesity, micronutrient deficiencies, and
malnutrition, in line with the Latin American trend (IICA, 2018). In terms of chronic
malnutrition, Guatemala is ranked seventh in the world (Romero, 2022). There is a
high percentage of food insecurity as well: 46.5% of children under five suffer from
chronic malnutrition (WFP, 2022). The highest rates of food insecurity are found in
the departments of Quiché, Baja Verapaz, and Huehuetenango (Läderach et al.,
2021). Guatemala's agriculture industry accounts for 9.4% of GDP (World Bank,
2021b), making it the second largest market in Central America for US exports of
processed food items. As such, Guatemala is extremely susceptible to shocks to the
global food supply.   
 
The government is heavily dependent on the international community for
emergency financing as a result of not having enough money to address problems
with food security and to provide basic healthcare (Müller et al., 2020). Additionally,
poor governance and corruption have hampered the state's capacity to respond to
the population needs during times of crisis and has undermined efforts of
adaptation and mitigation of climate change (Nett & Rüttinger, 2016; Notre Dame
University, 2022). 
Human Mobility 
 
Poverty, unemployment, and violence have been the historic drivers of human
mobility in Guatemala. The Civil War produced an unprecedent outbreak of rural-
urban migration and, since the 1970s, there has been a large-scale transnational
flow of exiled populations moving towards Mexico and the United States (Jonas,
2013). Since then, indigenous populations have been especially prone to migrate
due to structural inequalities and marginalization that they have historically
suffered (Taylor et al., 2006; Jonas, 2013). Human mobility in the country is
influenced by various factors, such as violence, gender-based violence (GBV),
extortion, corruption, geophysical natural disasters and rising climate variability
and the higher intensity and frequency of extreme weather events (Milan & Ruano,
2014; Pons, 2021).   
 
According to an IDMC report (2023), by the end of 2022 there was a total of
316,000 internally displaced people (IDP). Conflicts and human insecurities, largely
influenced by climate variability on rain-fed agriculture, were the main push factors,
motivating 242,000 of those IDPs to migrate, while extreme weather events were
the second reason for internal displacement, accounting for 74,000 IDPs (IMDC,
2023). Rural-urban mobility, towards main cities such as Guatemala City, is a
growing trend characterized by insecure and vulnerable urban contexts, without
the necessary urban planning and social services to absorb the demands of a
growing population (Nett and Rüttinger, 2016; IOM, 2021). On the other hand, rural-
rural movements are mainly linked to seasonal work, involving internal migration or
towards bordering regions, as it constitutes an alternative livelihood strategy for
farmers and indigenous communities that work on cash crop plantations, such as
coffee, sugar cane and plantain that is produced (Ruiz de Oña et al., 2019).   
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        7
Page 9:
In the case of transnational mobility, its estimated that 12 to 14% of Guatemalan
citizens are currently living abroad, primarily in the United States, where more than
1.8 million Guatemalans are believed to be residing (JICA, 2022; Moslimani et al.,
n.d.). According to UNHCR (2022), the United States has received 157,113 asylum-
Seekers and 25,552 refugees from Guatemala, while in Mexico there are 4,125
Asylum-Seekers and 8,184 refugees. Additionally, 50 per cent of migrants deported
from the United States, including non-accompanied minors, are estimated to come
from Guatemala (Tejiendo Paz, 2020). The lack of support for returned migrants
makes Guatemalan returnees particularly vulnerable to socioeconomic
marginalization (Worby, 2013). 
 
Guatemala has become a host and transit country, as it is part of the Central
American route for people migrating to the United States (IOM, 2022). According to
UNHCR (2022), Guatemala hosts 701 refugees and up to 1,519 asylum-seekers. The
absence of official channels to facilitate migration procedures and ensure the
protection of migrants from Latin America to the United States has pushed the use
of irregular channels through smugglers and has exposed migrants to human
trafficking and life-threatening risks (Delavelle, 2015; UN, 2013). Issues like border
enforcement, separation of families, deportations and human rights violations
against migrants are currently part of the political debate responding to the
concerns of an international community trying to deal with the increasing number
of people attempting to migrate to the United States (Frelick et al., 2016; Sørensen,
2016). 
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        8

Guatemala is characterized by high rates of poverty and inequality, as well as a
significant incidence of violent acts and generalized social tension. Climate change
impacts on temperatures, rainfall patterns and extreme weather events are
deepening the challenges of marginalized populations regarding food security,
livelihood options, housing needs and access/availability of natural resources.
Domestic and international migration constitutes a common adaptative strategy for
individuals, households and communities experiencing these hardships, while also
posing a challenge to populations suffering from involuntary immobility. However,
human mobility can also trigger conflicts, social tensions and human security risks.
Simultaneously, violence, socioenvironmental conflicts, and extreme weather and
geophysical events are common drivers of displacement. In turn, displacement is
also frequently linked to socioeconomic and climate vulnerabilities, as well as social
tensions and human security risks. The purpose of this factsheet is therefore to
explore these complex interactions between climate adaptation, socioeconomic
vulnerabilities, human mobility and the root causes of conflict in Guatemala. To
acknowledge and conceptualize these interactions four main pathways were
identified: 
 
Pathway 1: Conflict and human security risks as a result of climate-related
migration. 
Pathway 2: Conflict and human security risks as a result of displacement produced
by climate-related and geophysical disasters . 
Pathway 3: Compounding risks and vulnerabilities as a result of displacement
produced by violence. 
 
Pathway 4: Immobility and trapped populations

In Guatemala, changes in rainfall patterns, rising temperatures and extreme
weather events, mediated by socioeconomic inequalities and institutional
vulnerabilities, have negatively affected the availability and access to natural
resources, including arable land, water sources, forests and fish populations (Ferré
García et al., 2023). Similarly, there is extensive evidence on how climate variability
and extreme weather events negatively affect livelihood and food security of local
communities in Guatemala (Ferré García et al., 2023; Medina et al., 2023; Howland
et al., 2021; Britos et al., 2023). Individuals and households experiencing livelihood
and food insecurity rely on diverse coping strategies, including migrating towards
more prosperous areas, less impacted by climate change and with other income-
generating opportunities (Christian Aid, 2019; Britos et al., 2023). However, despite
the relevance of migration as an adaptation strategy, migration is also often linked
with different human security risks during transit and in receiving areas (Penel et
al., 2023). Likewise, communities experiencing scarcity or limited access to natural
resources are compelled to migrate to areas with greater availability of resources,
sometimes leading to competition and conflict escalation with other groups seeking
the same natural resources (Ferré García et al., 2023; Long & Hatting, 2018). 
Climate impacts on livelihood insecurity and the availability and access to
natural resources  
 
The effects of climate change such as rising temperatures, changes in rainfall
patterns and coastal degradation are already affecting important sectors of the
economy that are crucial for food production and employment provision in
Guatemala, including agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries (FAO, 2018;
Harvey et al., 2018). These consequences are especially negative on vulnerable
populations dependent on small-scale subsistence agriculture and/or informal
employment as well as marginalized populations such as women and indigenous
people (Alpízar et al., 2020; IPC, 2022; WFP, 2022). 
 
Small-scale agriculture constitutes the main source of food for households in rural
Guatemala, and is one of the main economic sectors, representing up to 30.4% per
cent of the total employment in the country (ILO, 2021). However, most small-scale
farmers are highly dependent on precipitation patterns, as rain-fed agriculture is
widely practiced throughout the country and accounts for 71 per cent of the total
agricultural output (WFP et al., 2017; USAID, 2017; Deza et al., 2022). Climate
variability, such as irregular rainfall and prolonged dry spells have increased water
evaporation and soil erosion, lowering crop productivity (Vargas et al., 2017;
Beveridge et al., 2019). Suboptimal agricultural conditions are already affecting
crop yields, especially for smallholder rain-fed farmers, increasing crop losses for
staple foods like corn, beans and rice in the region (Harvey et al., 2018; Pons,
2021). It is projected that agricultural productivity will experience a decline by
2050,  as  evidenced by potential yield reductions of  35  percent for sugarcane and 1. CONFLICT AND HUMAN SECURITY RISKS AS A
RESULT OF CLIMATE-RELATED MIGRATION

Page 12:
14 percent for maize and beans (Castellanos et al., 2018). Expected agricultural
losses are especially concerning in the departments that are part of the Central
American Dry Corridor, where there have been agricultural output reductions, due
to severe droughts aggravated by the ENSO effects (WFP, 2019a). For instance, in
2019, extreme droughts caused 500,000 people in the Guatemalan Central
American Dry Corridor to suffer from food insecurity, and the longer dry spells
affected up to 80% of subsistence agricultural production (WFP, 2019b; Valencia,
2022). 
Climate variability and extreme weather events are not only affecting staple crops,
but also key cash crops such as coffee, bananas, cardamom and sugar cane, which
translates into economic losses and less employment opportunities for seasonal
workers in larger plantations (Tucker et al., 2010; Olivera et al., 2021; Luna, 2022).
The lack of availability and access to water is a critical factor leading to low
productivity and crop losses (Milan & Ruano, 2014). Similarly, rising temperatures
are also negatively affecting crops by altering the optimal elevation of certain cash
crops such as coffee and increasing the risk of plant pests and diseases, such as
coffee leaf rust (Avelino et al., 2015). Between 2012 and 2013, coffee leaf rust
affected up to 70% of the total coffee production and led to more than 75,000 job
losses in Guatemala (ICO, 2013). Lower incomes also have implications for the
ability of households to allocate resources towards the acquisition of fertilizers and
livestock, creating a negative feedback loop and curtailing adaptive strategies
(Baumeister, 1993; Rivera Lima, 2022). Furthermore, extreme weather events also
have negative impacts on food and livelihood security by affecting directly crops,
farms and transport infrastructure, increasing food production costs and disrupting
the food supply chain (Hellin et al., 2017; Pons, 2021). This has led in some cases to
rises in food prices, affecting urban households, reducing their purchasing power
and food affordability (Milan & Ruano, 2014). 
Cash and staple crops losses and failed harvests, intensified during the mid-
summer drought period, lead to insufficient food reserves to meet the daily
nutritional needs (WFP, 2022). For instance, between June and September 2022, it
was estimated that 4.6 million people suffered from acute food insecurity in the
country, due to droughts and changes in rainfall patterns (IPC, 2022). Children and
women show higher rates of malnutrition and are found to encounter a greater
number of adverse outcomes resulting from food insecurity (Vargas et. al, 2017;
MSPAS, 2017). For instance, children are especially vulnerable to certain coping
mechanisms, such as changing dietary elements during food shortages (OCHA,
2023; Barba-Escoto et al., 2020). Similarly, a quick gender analysis conducted by  
OCHA (2023) evidenced gendered differences on food insecurity rates related to
climate-impacts on agricultural outputs.  
The increasing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events and climate
variability can also have a negative impact on land quality in the country. Changes
in precipitation patterns, which can be exacerbated by ENSO, are one of the main
reasons for land degradation in Guatemala, as dry spells contribute to
desertification and torrential rains result in land erosion (MARN  et  al., 2021). Since 
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        11
Page 13:
2007, arable land in Guatemala has decreased significantly, which is also negatively
impacted by tropical storms and hurricanes affecting crops and farming
infrastructure (Waddick, 2017). This situation is especially alarming in the
Guatemalan Dry Corridor, where prolonged dry spells and soil aridity have
decreased agricultural productivity and, consequently, food security (WFP, 2019b).
Similarly, climate variability has contributed to pasture degradation, affecting
communities living off livestock, and especially those who use double purpose
cattle systems (Hernandez et al., 2019). In the main areas of cattle farming, such as
Petén, pasture degradation has produced important economic losses, decreasing
milk production between 7 to 34 per cent and beef production between 13 to 41
per cent (Betancourt & Pezo, 2007). 
Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns have repercussions on forests leading
to soil degradation and creating favorable conditions for the reproduction of pests,
such as the pine bark tree, also known as gorgojo del pino (Cervantes-Martínez et
al., 2019). Located in the region with the fastest deforestation rates in the world,
Guatemala reports a deforestation rate of 60,000 ha per year - a net annual loss
rate of 1% forest cover (FAO, 2022; FAO & Banco Mundial, 2012; Sales et al., 2016).
Deforested areas are more vulnerable to landslides and soil erosion, which is
especially problematic in the south and center of the country (ECLAC et al., 2018).
As availability and access to suitable lands for agriculture and cattle farming are
affected by increasing climate variability, dependence on forestry resources and
forested land increases, producing additional pressures on forest ecosystems,
already threatened by climate change (Medina et al., 2023). 
 
The availability and accessibility of water sources has also been affected by
increasing climate variability, which is particularly alarming considering that 70 per
cent of the main economic activities contributing to GDP are dependent on access
to water (MARN et al., 2021). Changes in rainfall patterns exacerbate issues around
water availability, particularly during more intense and prolonged drought episodes
linked to ENSO, strongly affecting the west-central highlands, north Petén and the
departments located in the Central American Dry Corridor (USAID, 2017). Two river
basins constitute the main water scarcity hotspots in the country: the María Linda
basin, categorized as stressed and the Mopán-Hondo basins, where the local
population depend on a lake to avoid absolute scarcity conditions (Imbach et al.,
2015).  
Population growth in Guatemala, expected to be the highest in the Central
American region by 2100 with a 2.3% rate, will create additional pressures on water
availability per capita (Bárcena et al., 2013). Although current rates do not show a
low water per capita rate, the unequal distribution across geographies and society
is a crucial factor that mediates the exacerbating impact that climate change will
progressively have on water availability in the country (Bárcena et al., 2013). Water

This not only exacerbates food insecurity but also heightens the potential for conflicts. The Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs), especially in northern counties like Turkana, are particularly vulnerable, experiencing a surge in climate-induced food shortages compounded by escalating conflict risks. The hotspots analysis presented in this factsheet highlights the critical convergence of extreme climate and conflict events, coupled with various food insecurity indicators. Alarmingly, counties such as Turkana, Tana River, and Lamu exhibit a co-occurrence of high conflict, drought stress, and poor-to-borderline Food Consumption Scores (FCS). Mandera, Meru, and Kajiado report crisis or emergency levels of reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI), aligning with both climatic stresses and conflict risks. Examination of crisis-to-emergency Livelihood Coping Strategies (LCS) and the percentage of individuals in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3 and above reveals severe situations in counties like Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Garissa, Wajir, Tana River, and Isiolo, compounded by escalating conflict risks and drought stress. Specific regions, including Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, and Wajir, persistently grapple with high conflict and severe drought, presenting ongoing challenges. Notably, Turkana emerges as the most vulnerable, marked by borderline FCS, emergency rCSI, and a significant share of population facing alarming food security phases. Recognizing data gaps during hotspot mapping underscores the imperative for enhanced data collection efforts, including improved satellite imagery, on-the-ground assessments, and collaboration with local entities and governments. The World Food Programme (WFP) in Kenya plays a pivotal role in addressing these challenges through targeted interventions, encompassing climate-resilient agricultural practices, conflict-sensitive food distribution, and community-based resilience-building initiatives.

Mozambique has approximately 45% of its population living below the
poverty line and additionally is amongst the most climatically challenged
countries. With approximately 80% of its population relying on subsistence
agriculture, this sector is the cornerstone of the country’s economy.
Cropland areas are interspaced with forests and shrubland (Figure 1),
spanning limited regions across the southern coastal area, the central
Manica province, the western part of Sofala, as well as the coastal part of
Zambezia, Nampula and Cabo Delgado in the north (Figure 2). The majority
of Mozambique’s cropland is dedicated to growing staple crops such as rice,
maize, sorghum, and cassava, all of which rely on key climatic conditions for
productivity. Recently, the rise in extreme climatic events such as floods,
drought and severe heat have strained agricultural resources, making it
challenging for farmers to maintain their livelihoods ( 1). Sofala province,
mostly acclimated for maize production often faces climate-induced
challenges such as more frequent and extreme drought and flood events,
affecting food security and the people’s livelihoods. INTRODUCTION

Systems analysis to support WFP regional action on climate resilience for MozambiqueMozambique is predominantly a summer rainfall region that experiences
considerable inter-annual climate variability. Such variability, characterized
by seasonal precipitation anomalies is primarily influenced by regional
climate drivers such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian
Ocean Dipole (IOD), or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) ( 2 , 6). ENSO,
characterized by the periodic warming (El Niño) and cooling (La Niña) of sea
surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, can lead to droughts or
excessive rainfall in different parts of Mozambique ( 2 , 7). Similarly, the Indian
Ocean Dipole (IOD), which refers to the temperature gradient between the
eastern and western Indian Ocean, affects monsoon patterns and rainfall
distribution, impacting agricultural activities. Additionally, the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO), a fluctuation in atmospheric pressure over the North
Atlantic region, influences winter climate variability, potentially leading to
extreme weather events like storms and prolonged periods of rainfall or
droughts ( 7). Together with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a long-
lived El Niño-like oscillatory pattern of climate variability based on switching
ocean temperature anomalies, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)
which represents low-frequency ocean cycle as well as solar activity changes
(SUN), these large-scale climate drivers and their interactions shape
Mozambique’s long-term climate variabilities and extremes (Figure 3).REGIONAL CLIMATE DRIVERS In terms of climate-related risks, Mozambique is one of the most exposed
African countries. The country is characterized by a tropical to sub-tropical
climate. With its extensive coastline supporting over 60% of its population,
Mozambique is highly vulnerable to tropical cyclones and flooding. The
country is also very prone to extreme hydrological events such as droughts
which is compounded by low water infrastructure and a lack of monitoring
systems ( 2 , 3). Weather extremes including droughts, floods and cyclones
frequently result in severe disasters in Mozambique, hampering the
country’s economy which is heavily reliant on rain-fed agriculture and thus
amplifying its climate-sensitivity ( 1 , 4). Central Mozambique, in particular the
Urema river sub-basin, experienced severe impacts from the 2019 tropical
cyclone Idai. This event resulted in heavy flooding with more than 30,000
people severely affected and a substantial loss of wildlife in a region
classified as a key biodiversity area ( 5).

PAST, CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE
VULNERABILITIES
Mozambique has experienced discernible shifts in climate patterns, leading
to adverse impacts to communities, livelihoods and environmental
degradation. This region is highly vulnerable to climate-induced shocks and
crises, with cyclones, floods and droughts being the most prominent
occurrences. In particular, the Urema river sub-basin area is currently highly
vulnerable to flooding, but also shows the highest risk of drought and heat
within Mozambique (Figure 4, a), making it a hotspot of compound climate
hazards (Figure 4, b). These conditions are expected to worsen in the future
with increased risk of drought, heat and flood events (Figure 4, a). Notably,
heightened vulnerability to drought and heat events is observed along the
Eastern Coast with a concentration in Central Mozambique and Sofala
province under future conditions (Figure 4, a).
Page 6:
We can also expect an incremental increase in flood events across the
entirety of Mozambique under future conditions, but particularly along the
Western part of Mozambique (Figure 4, a).
The compound impact of these climate-related hazards such as
simultaneous droughts and heatwaves or floods can result in substantial
loss and damage (Figure 4, b) ( 8). The greatest exposure to compound
hazards currently occurs in the Western to Central and Southern region of
Mozambique but has a substantial regional spread with a nucleus on the
coastline in future (Figure 4, b). All of Mozambique will be subject to medium
to high-risk compound hazards in future (Figure 4, b).
Figure 4: baseline (1980-2010) and future (2020-2040) climate hazards including
drought, heat, flood (a) and compound hazards (b). Compound hazards are
considered as the composite risk of heat, drought, and flood to determine the
cumulative impact of multiple hazards. An ensemble of 27 general circulation
models from different modelling centres globally is used to develop the indices.
Climate data are sourced from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP6). The climate pathway with high radiative forcing (SSP585) was used for the
future climate projection.

The agricultural sector is highly gendered, with women accounting for the
majority of the labour force. In 2019, the sector employed 80% of female
labour force ( 9). Gender equity disparities are evident across various regions
in Mozambique (Figure 5). Sofala is characterized by the lowest level of
gender equity, with Nampula, Manica also displaying relatively lower levels of
gender equity, followed by Tete and Gaza. Although these regions
demonstrate comparatively lower levels of gender equity, they still fall within
the medium range on a global scale (Figure 5). Provinces with the highest
gender equity include Inhambane, Maputo, Zambezia and Niassa (Figure 5).  
These spatial variations in gender equity highlight the need for targeted
interventions to promote equal opportunities. In regions where gender
disparities are more pronounced, focused interventions aimed at enhancing
access to education, resources and market opportunities could play a
pivotal role in fostering greater gender parity. 
Moreover, discrepancies such as market access add to the challenges faced
by the communities to efficiently build climate change resilience. Nampula
and Zambezia provinces display the lowest level of proximity to market
indicating a market isolation, increasing the cost of inputs and
transportation for farmers (Figure 6). The profound impacts of climate
change, coupled with limited resilience and heightened vulnerability of these
populations to environmental shocks needs to be considered when planning
Ecosystem-Based Adaptation and Nature-Based Solutions approaches.SOCIO-ECONOM IC VULNERABILITIES

CLIM ATE SM ART SYSTEM S USING
NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS
Based on the climate and socio-ecological risk assessment, several zones
can be identified which exhibit high risk of compound events and low coping
capacity (Figure 7). While multiple regions of Mozambique experience
different combinations of risk, these hotspots occur within Zambezia,
Nampula, Tete as well as Sofala and Maputo. Sofala has a particular
exposure to some of the highest compound risks (Figure 7, zone 2). There is
a high risk of both coastal and riverine flooding due to periods of intense
rainfall and to the impacts of tropical cyclones. Being a low-lying coastal
area, it is vulnerable to compound flood events occurring from combinations
of fluvial, pluvial and coastal drivers ( 1 0). Following recurring devastating
floods, there is a growing awareness locally of the necessity to implement
climate adaptation measures. Adding to the devastating impact of flooding,
drought events are also more recurrent in Sofala. With the projected
increase in the frequency of heat waves over this province (Figure 2),
projection of the compound effects of climate hazards shows an alarming
climate future requiring urgent and more sustainable adaptation and
mitigation strategies, such as integrated water resource management and
ecosystem-based solutions. 
In addition to the climate-induced biophysical impacts, adaptation strategies
should also place socio-economic vulnerabilities front and centre within the
region, in order to address the high gender disparities and low market
access for livelihood systems in the Urema river basin (Figure 5, 6). The
development of targeted climate-smart agricultural systems which foster
regenerative agriculture and protection of riverine systems should be
prioritized. The practices should be tailored to achieve sustainable and
equitable climate action by promoting positive peace and creating shared
values. Additionally, a focus on nature-based solutions can be used to foster
cooperation on natural resource management by promoting joint decision-
making, encouraging sustainable practices, and facilitating knowledge
sharing among diverse stakeholders, ultimately reducing conflicts over
scarce natural resources, and enhancing community resilience. Furthermore,
by ensuring that marginalised and vulnerable groups, such as women, youth
and ethnic minorities have access to resources, technologies, and decision-
making processes, nature-based solutions can contribute to dismantling the
systemic barriers that perpetuate social inequalities and exclusion in climate
action.

Climate Security Hotspots and Food Security Insights
FACTSHEETPhoto: ILRI

Climate Security Hotspots and Food Security InsightsHIGHLIGHTS
Kenya grapples with climate change challenges, experiencing erratic weather
patterns, prolonged droughts, and floods that significantly limit agricultural
productivity and natural resources availability. This not only exacerbates
food insecurity, impacting Kenyan economy, but also heightens the potential
for conflicts. The Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs), especially northern
counties like Turkana, are particularly vulnerable, and frequently experience
a surge in climate-induced food shortages compounded by escalating
conflict risks. 
The hotspots analysis presented in this factsheet highlights the critical
convergence of extreme climate and conflict events, coupled with various
food insecurity indicators. Alarmingly, counties such as Turkana, Tana River,
and Lamu exhibit a co-occurrence of high conflict, drought stress, and poor-
to-borderline Food Consumption Scores (FCS). Mandera, Meru, and Kajiado
report crisis or emergency levels of reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI),
aligning with both climatic stresses and conflict risks. Examination of crisis-
to-emergency Livelihood Coping Strategies (LCS) and the percentage of
individuals in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3 and
above reveals severe situations in counties like Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera,
Garissa, Wajir, Tana River, and Isiolo, compounded by escalating conflict
risks and drought stress. Specific regions, including Turkana, Marsabit,
Mandera, and Wajir, persistently grapple with high conflict and severe
drought, presenting ongoing challenges. Notably, Turkana emerges as the
most vulnerable, marked by borderline FCS, emergency rCSI, and a
significant share of population facing alarming food security phases. 
The World Food Programme (WFP) in Kenya plays a crucial role in addressing
the complex interplay of climate change, food insecurity, and peace through
targeted interventions. These interventions encompass climate-resilient
agricultural practices, conflict-sensitive food distribution, and community-
based resilience-building initiatives. The primary aim of this factsheet is to
provide a climate security perspective on the ground-level food insecurity
data collected by WFP, assessing the alignment of WFP intervention
priorities with climate security hotspots. The analysis serves as an
informative tool for WFP, indicating the need to reassess target areas or
incorporate new ones in response to climate-related security risks.
Additionally, it helps identify various data gaps, contributing to the
enhancement of data collection efforts.

The global community has already recognized the importance of peace and
stability for sustainable and resilient food systems. Yet, these systems
encounter challenges extending beyond the realm of violent conflict. Diverse
factors impede the productivity and inclusivity of food systems, particularly
affecting marginalized populations and hindering their capacity to ensure
widespread access to nutritious diets. Among others, environmental stress
compounds these challenges, posing a significant threat to both lives and
livelihoods. This heightened environmental pressure often leads to climate-
induced food shortages, exacerbating the ongoing food insecurity situations.
This pattern becomes particularly problematic in fragile settings, where food
insecurity is not only a consequence of increasing conflict risks but also a
contributing factor to the emergence and duration of such crises [1].
Kenya, like many other regions, is grappling with the multifaceted challenges
posed by climate change, including erratic weather patterns, prolonged
droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. In the northern counties, for
instance, these shifting climatic patterns have significantly compromised
water storage capacity and infrastructure, thereby leading to substantial
economic losses, particularly within the livestock and agricultural sectors [2].
Such a changing climate has a profound negative impact on productivity and
natural resource availability, consequently exacerbating food insecurity [3].
Among the most affected are pastoral communities in the Arid and Semi-Arid
Lands (ASALs), particularly in marginalized cross-border agricultural areas,
where a staggering 3.1 million people grappled with food insecurity in early
2022 [4]. A combination of factors - including the five consecutive seasons
of below-average rainfall culminating in El Niño flooding during the 2023
short rain season, diminished crop and livestock production, localized
conflicts, and soared food prices - has further contributed to the escalating
levels of food insecurity among these vulnerable populations [5]. 
Given these circumstances, a primary challenge lies in acknowledging the
intricate relationships at play and strategically planning well-informed
interventions to bolster food security and foster sustainable livelihoods in
vulnerable communities. An assessment of areas where climate and conflict
events co-occur, coupled with comprehensive food security data, may serve
as a critical tool for the World Food Programme (WFP) in Kenya. CLIMATE, CONFLICT AND FOOD
SECURITY IN KENYA
Climate Security Hotspots and Food Security Insights
Page 4:
Figures 1-4 depict various combinations of climate, conflict, and food
insecurity indicators across Kenya. The climate-conflict dynamics explored
include all conflict clusters (high, moderate, and low conflict) combined with
all drought levels (high, moderate, and low drought), high conflict clusters
combined with all drought levels, and high drought stress level combined
with all conflict clusters. The food security indicators examined encompass
Food Consumption Score (FCS), reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI),
Livelihood Coping Strategies (LCS), and Integrated Food Security Phase
Classification. 
Figure 1 illustrates the co-occurrence of conflict dynamics and climate
conditions, alongside poor and borderline Food Consumption Score (FCS).
Notably, counties experiencing the simultaneous presence of high conflict
and high-to-low drought stress predominantly exhibit poor and borderline
FCS. Turkana, Tana River, and Lamu, in particular, stand out as the most
food-insecure counties - as evidenced by their poor and borderline FCS
scores - grappling with severe heat stress and high conflict. Exploring the
different climate security hotspots, in Turkana they include Nakalale,
Kakuma, Letea, Lopur, Songot, Turkwel, Kanamkemer, Kang’Atotha, Lodwar
Township, Kalobeyei, Kaaleng/Kaikor, Kibish and Lokichoggio wards. These
wards report disparities in nutrition, inequality and resource availability,
consistent with the overall county situation. According to MoALFC (2021),
Turkana is ranked as the third county in Kenya in terms of poverty levels,
with an estimated 87.5% of people living below the poverty line. The county
is also significantly affected by dry spells that often result in drying water
sources, starving livestock, and resource-based conflicts [6]. Climate change
impacts and security concerns primarily impact children below 5 years,
women, youth, pastoralists and fishing communities. The most severely
affected wards (hotspots) in the county (those in the high conflict-high
drought stress category) are Nakalale, Kakuma, Letea, Lopur and Songot. In
Tana River county, Sala and Madogo wards present co-occurrence of high
conflict and drought stress. Lastly, in Lamu county  an intersection of high
conflict and moderate drought stress occurs in Hindi, Mkomani, Mkunumbi,
Shella and Basuba wards.HOTSPOTS INSIGHTSThis information can empower WFP to craft targeted and effective
interventions for vulnerable areas and communities. This integrated
approach - namely the combination of climate, conflict, and food insecurity
data over space and time - can facilitate the anticipation and mitigation of
climate-induced food crises, thereby contributing building resilience and
advancing sustainable and conflict-sensitive food systems.

Figure 2 presents the co-occurrence of climate security hotspots overlaid
with stressed and crisis/emergency reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI)
levels. According to the rCSI, Turkana, Mandera, Tana River, Meru, and
Kajiado are currently at emergency level. Considering the co-occurrence
both FCS and rCSI, along with the co-occurrence of both climatic stresses
and conflict risks, Turkana and Tana River continue to face an alarming
situation. In the case of Kajiado, cases of moderate conflict and high-to-low
drought conditions are reported in Dalalekutuk, Ildamat, Imaroro, Kaputiei
North, Iloodokilani, Keekonyokie, Matapato South and Entonet/Lenkisim
wards.  Simultaneously, Meru exhibits the following climate security
hotspots (high-to-moderate conflict and high-to-low drought conditions):
Karama, Muthara, Athwana and Kianjai wards. Mandera’s hotspots are
located at: Elwak South, Kutulo, Shimbir Fatuma, Arabia, Bulla Mpya,
Khalalio, Neboi, Township wards.
Figure 3 displays the co-occurrence of climate security hotspots along with
crisis and emergency Livelihood Coping Strategies (LCS). Counties with
worse levels of LCS include Tana River and Mandera. These counties
present the same critical climate security hotspots presented above.

According to IPC’s classification, the ASALs of North and North Eastern
Kenya are mostly affected, with notable impacts observed in Turkana,
Marsabit, Mandera, Garissa, Wajir, and Isiolo. As previously highlighted,
these counties experience different forms of co-occurrence of high-to-
moderate conflict with different drought conditions. While Turkana and
Mandera showcase high conflict and hight-to-moderate drought conditions
hotspots (the wards are the ones listed in the previous sections), Garissa,
Wajir, and Isiolo report the following: high conflicts and moderate-high
drought stress in Balambala, Garissa Township, Eldas, Tarbaj, Wajir East,

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In recent years, climate variability and escalating conflict risks have become
significant concerns in various Kenyan counties. The hotspots depicted in
Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 consider both deteriorating climatic conditions and
instances of conflict, pinpointing locations (at 20 km2) that have been
severely impacted by the interplay of these two factors.
Page 8:
From 2017 to 2022, specific regions in Kenya consistently grappled with
both high conflict and severe drought, presenting significant challenges for
the local population, including increasing resource scarcity, violence, and
weakening rainfed-related agricultural livelihoods. These areas include
Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, Mandera, Garissa, Samburu, Isiolo, Wajir, Laikipia,
Baringo, Tana River, Lamu, Narok, and Mombasa. Notably, among these
counties, Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Tana River, Garissa, Isiolo, and
Lamu stand out as particularly vulnerable to an increasing convergence of
climate-related security risks, specifically concerning high conflict and high
drought indicators.
While the overall food security situation in the ASALs has shown
improvement over time, certain specific areas continue to grapple with
significant food insecurity challenges. From 2017 to 2022, Turkana, Tana
River, Marsabit, Mandera, Garissa, and Wajir consistently report alarming
food insecurity indicators, particularly with respect to the reduced Coping
Strategies Index (rCSI) and the percentage of the population in a crisis or
emergency food insecurity IPC phase. 
The synthesis of these insights underscores the complex interplay of climate
variability, conflict risks, and food insecurity. While causality is not implied,
this analysis clearly demonstrates how, under certain context-specific
circumstance, - including the increasing frequency of extreme weather
events, the high dependence on rainfed agriculture, and a rapidly growing
population - the convergence of climatic and socio-economic factors can
give rise to localized vicious cycles of vulnerability, emphasizing the
importance of spatial autocorrelation – a concept suggesting that
“Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related
than distant things.”[7]. Consequently, the positive spatial dependence of
climate variability, conflict risks, and food insecurity may suggest a
reinforcing dynamic when combined in a specific context, creating a pressing
need for humanitarian assistance and sustainable development initiatives.
Improving data collection is essential to grasp the intricate dynamics of
climate variability, conflict risks, and food insecurity in Kenya. Addressing
some of the identified data gaps – such as the limited granularity of food
security information, and the constraints of conflict data provided by event-
based datasets - requires advanced satellite imagery for real-time insights,
on-the-ground assessments involving local communities, and collaboration
with governments for access to relevant data.

Utilizing technologies like remote sensing and GIS can enhance accuracy and
timeliness. These refined data collection methods are crucial for informed
strategies, aiding organizations like the World Food Programme in
developing targeted interventions to tackle the multifaceted challenges
faced by vulnerable communities in Kenya.
The World Food Programme can play a pivotal role by focusing on these
high-risk areas, contributing to enhanced food security for the most
vulnerable populations in Kenya. This may involve targeted interventions,
such as the provision of climate-resilient agricultural practices, conflict-
sensitive food distribution strategies, and community-led resilience-building
initiatives.

APPENDIX
Definitions
Climate clusters describe a range of suitable to adverse climate condition,
based on six agro-climatic indicators. The adverse climate cluster is
characterized, among others, by low precipitation, and high to moderate
climate water deficit. The terminology in the figures refers to high,
moderate, and low drought stress. High drought stress is characterized by
low values of precipitation (multi-annual median) of 239.27 mm, high-
moderate values of climate water deficit (multi-annual median) of 1402.87
mm, moderate-low values of actual evapotranspiration (multi-annual
median) of 164.79 mm, high values of number of days with ratio of actual to
potential evapotranspiration ratio below 0.5 (multi-annual median) of 175.74
number of days), low values of number of days with ratio of actual to
potential evapotranspiration ratio below 0.5 (multi-annual coefficient of
variation) (0.05 proportion), low values of number of days with waterlogging
(multi-annual median) (0 number of days). Climate data covers years ranging
from 1990 until 2022.

Para esto, es necesario aunar esfuerzos institucionales a fin de fomentar el establecimiento de plataformas multiactor alrededor de cadenas de valor de relevancia para el sector primario, y plantear estrategias de mejora con enfoque de sostenibilidad. Este documento, es el resultado de un proceso de construcción participativa entre los actores que hacen parte de la cadena productiva del cacao en el departamento del Cesar, con la orientación de la Alianza de Bioversity International y el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT). En términos cuantitativos, el proceso contó con la participación de 113 personas, entre ellas representantes del sector productivo, proveedores de insumos agrícolas, industrias procesadoras, comercializadoras, entidades de investigación, y prestadores de servicios de apoyo al subsector cacaotero.
Así entonces, esta estrategia se constituye en un acuerdo de voluntades para el planteamiento de una estrategia sectorial que busca mejorar la competitividad del encadenamiento y el desarrollo de un sistema productivo sostenible. En el ámbito ambiental, la estrategia busca contribuir al desarrollo de acciones que contrarresten la deforestación, reduzcan emisiones asociadas al uso del suelo, y promuevan la conservación de los bosques y la restauración de paisajes. La construcción de esta estrategia para la sostenibilidad de la cadena del cacao del Cesar es el resultado de un esfuerzo colaborativo entre la Iniciativa Climática Internacional (IKI) y las iniciativas de investigación del CGIAR “Sistemas de Innovación Agroalimentaria Resilientes en América Latina y el Carible (AgriLAC Resiliente)” y “Low-Emission Food Systems (Mitigate+)”. Por último, es necesario enunciar que el documento cuenta con el aval del Comité Departamental del Cacao del Cesar dado que considera en su contenido los lineamientos de la Ley 811 de 2003.

En 2016, el Gobierno nacional y las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-
Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP) firmaron un acuerdo de paz, que incluye objetivos 
relacionados con el desarrollo rural sostenible de las zonas afectadas por el 
conflicto armado. Además, el Gobierno ha expresado su compromiso con la 
agenda de mitigación y adaptación al cambio climático internacional que incluye el 
Acuerdo de París, las Metas Aichi y el proyecto de restauración de tierras Iniciativa 
20x20. Estas prioridades nacionales implican facilitar los usos sostenibles del 
suelo y las prácticas de gestión sostenible de la tierra como elemento integral para 
superar el conflicto armado que ha afrontado el país durante los últimos 50 años y 
contribuir a la consolidación de la paz en Colombia. Para hacerlo, es necesario el 
desarrollo de sistemas sostenibles de uso del suelo (SLUS, por sus siglas en inglés) 
y estrategias de mejora de cadenas de valor adaptadas a contextos específicos, 
típicamente presentes en áreas de conflicto y posconflicto. 
Este enfoque está estrechamente alineado con las actividades que en Colombia 
se han priorizado en las estrategias de cambio climático y construcción de paz, 
así como en el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo (PND) 2022–2026 que plantea metas 
para contrarrestar la deforestación y fomentar el desarrollo sostenible del 
sector primario a través de la transformación productiva y la acción climática. El 
presente documento representa la estrategia para la sostenibilidad de la cadena 
del cacao en el departamento del Cesar, como resultado del trabajo colaborativo 
entre el proyecto “Implementando sistemas productivos sostenibles agrícolas y 
pecuarios para simultáneamente alcanzar la conservación de los bosques para la 
mitigación del cambio climático (REDD+) y la construcción de la paz en Colombia”, 
en adelante proyecto SLUS, y las iniciativas de investigación de CGIAR  “Sistemas 
de Innovación Agroalimentaria Resilientes en América Latina y el Carible (AgriLAC 
Resiliente)” y “Low-Emission Food Systems (Mitigate+)”. Resumen ejecutivo
xii
Page 13:
A nivel internacional, el Proyecto1 está alineado con las discusiones globales para reducir las emisiones de la 
agricultura, silvicultura y otros usos de la tierra (AFOLU, por sus siglas en inglés) y las iniciativas globales para 
restaurar los paisajes, como por ejemplo la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático 
(CMNUCC) y el Desafío de Bonn, respectivamente. A nivel nacional, la iniciativa se fundamenta en el desarrollo de 
acciones para contribuir en la reducción de emisiones asociadas al uso del suelo, la conservación de los bosques, la 
restauración de paisajes degradados y la construcción de paz en zonas rurales afectadas por el conflicto armado. 
Para Colombia y el departamento del Cesar, el cacao se ha perfilado como un cultivo con potencial para hacer 
frente a los retos derivados de la firma del acuerdo de paz entre el Gobierno nacional y las FARC-EP , y a problemas 
regionales de deforestación y degradación ambiental. En primera instancia, porque los procesos asociativos, 
producto de la organización entre cultivadores, se pueden configurar como escenarios de creación de capital social 
y redes de contacto esenciales en escenarios de posconflicto; y en segunda instancia, porque el establecimiento 
de cultivos bajo sistemas agroforestales (SAF), representa un potencial para el desarrollo de prácticas productivas 
sostenibles en términos de recuperación de bosques (Castro-Núñez et al., 2020; Charry et al., 2019).
Esta estrategia es el resultado de un proceso de construcción participativa entre los actores de la cadena 
departamental del cacao, con la orientación de la Alianza de Bioversity International y el Centro Internacional de 
Agricultura Tropical (CIAT). El enfoque metodológico requirió la realización de reuniones y talleres para identificar, 
analizar y priorizar las brechas que limitan la cadena en términos de sostenibilidad y competitividad. Así, el 
documento concluye en un plan de mejoramiento validado por el Comité Departamental de la Cadena del Cacao del 
Cesar, respecto a la capacidad de respuesta institucional y la inclusión de elementos orientados a la persecución 
de objetivos comunes.
Es importante resaltar que el plan de acción de la cadena tiene como principal pilar una visión conjunta 
proyectada al año 2032, la cual se articula con la visión 2038 del sector agropecuario del Departamento. 
Asimismo, responde a los requerimientos de la Ley 811 de 2003, que establece los lineamientos para la 
inscripción de cadenas productivas ante el Ministerio de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (MinAgricultura), 
y demanda enfocarse en los siguientes nueve puntos: i) productividad y competitividad; ii) desarrollo de 
mercado de bienes y factores de la cadena; iii) disminución de costos de transacción; iv) desarrollo de alianzas 
estratégicas; v) transferencia de información entre los agentes de la cadena; vi) vinculación de pequeños 
productores y empresarios; vii) manejo de recursos naturales y medio ambiente; viii) formación de recursos 
humanos; e ix) investigación y desarrollo tecnológico.
Además, el documento presenta un análisis de los costos de producción del cultivo e incluye la descripción de 
los actores (macro, meso y micro) que participan del encadenamiento, así como la manera en la que fomentan 
la adopción de sistemas y prácticas sostenibles del uso de la tierra desde el cumplimiento de su objeto social. Al 
respecto, se resalta el interés conjunto en el desarrollo sostenible y en trabajar por los compromisos regionales 
para mitigar los impactos del cambio climático y fomentar la paz territorial. Esta situación resalta la progresiva 
configuración de un escenario departamental favorable para la generación de sinergias institucionales y el 
desarrollo de iniciativas que beneficien al subsector cacaotero; por ejemplo, en el establecimiento del cultivo 
de cacao bajo SAF como alternativa de ingresos para los campesinos y como estrategia que contribuye a la 
recuperación de áreas deforestadas. Por último, se exponen conclusiones y recomendaciones que se espera 
sirvan de insumo para que el Gobierno nacional, las organizaciones de productores, la industria, y en general 
todo el ecosistema productivo que rodea la cadena en el Departamento, avancen de manera satisfactoria en la 
implementación del plan de acción.

|       Estrategia para la sostenibilidad de la cadena de cacao en Cesar1.1. Antecedentes
Articulación de la estrategia con los principales  
compromisos internacionales del Estado colombiano  
y con planes e instrumentos de desarrollo territorial
La presente estrategia se desarrolló con el objetivo de contribuir a la reducción de 
emisiones asociadas al uso del suelo, la conservación de los bosques, la restauración 
de paisajes degradados y la construcción de paz en las zonas rurales afectadas por 
el conflicto armado. 
Para el desarrollo del Proyecto, fueron priorizadas las cadenas productivas de 
cacao y ganadería doble propósito en los departamentos del Cesar y Caquetá. La 
iniciativa integra los siguientes cuatro componentes: i) integración de políticas 
para reducir la deforestación y avanzar en el proceso de restauración de paisajes; 
ii) implementación de sistemas sostenibles del uso de la tierra (SLUS) ajustados al 
contexto local para facilitar la adopción; iii) planteamiento de estrategias de cadenas 
productivas encaminadas a superar las brechas para la implementación de los SLUS 
y su promoción desde cada eslabón; y iv) diseño de modelos de negocio compatibles 1. INTRODUCCIÓN

Ruta hacia la acción climática y la construcción de paz      | con los SLUS. Este documento corresponde a la estrategia para la sostenibilidad de la cadena del cacao 
del Cesar y obedece al tercer componente enunciado. 
Si bien los SLUS hacen referencia a prácticas sostenibles a nivel finca, su escalamiento requiere de la 
articulación institucional y del enfoque de cadena para que, a través de la acción participativa de los 
actores para la consecución de metas comunes a nivel social, económico y ambiental, se propicie un 
ambiente habilitador para superar barreras estructurales a la adopción. Esta estrategia busca orientar a 
los actores de la cadena productiva del cacao en el Cesar sobre las acciones de desarrollo sostenible y, a 
su vez, contribuir con el cierre de brechas de competitividad del encadenamiento. La presente estrategia 
sectorial está alineada con algunos compromisos que ha asumido el país en el marco de algunos acuerdos 
internacionales en materia de desarrollo sostenible (Tabla 1).

Para esto, es necesario aunar esfuerzos institucionales a fin de fomentar el establecimiento de plataformas multiactor alrededor de cadenas de valor de relevancia para el sector primario, y plantear estrategias de mejora con enfoque de sostenibilidad. Este documento, es el resultado de un proceso de construcción participativa entre los actores que hacen parte de la cadena productiva del cacao en el departamento del Caquetá, con la orientación de la Alianza de Bioversity International y el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT). En términos cuantitativos, el proceso contó con la participación de 114 personas, entre ellas representantes del sector productivo, proveedores de insumos agrícolas, industrias procesadoras, comercializadoras, entidades de investigación, y prestadores de servicios de apoyo al subsector cacaotero. Así entonces, esta estrategia se constituye en un acuerdo de voluntades para el planteamiento de una estrategia sectorial que busca mejorar la competitividad del encadenamiento y el desarrollo de un sistema productivo sostenible. En el ámbito ambiental, la estrategia busca contribuir al desarrollo de acciones que contrarresten la deforestación, reduzcan emisiones asociadas al uso del suelo, y promuevan la conservación de los bosques y la restauración de paisajes. La construcción de esta estrategia para la sostenibilidad de la cadena del cacao del Caquetá es el resultado de un esfuerzo colaborativo entre la Iniciativa Climática Internacional (IKI) y las iniciativas de investigación del CGIAR “Sistemas de Innovación Agroalimentaria Resilientes en América Latina y el Carible (AgriLAC Resiliente)” y “Low-Emission Food Systems (Mitigate+)”. Por último, es necesario enunciar que el documento cuenta con el aval del Comité Departamental del Cacao del Caquetá dado que considera en su contenido los lineamientos de la Ley 811 de 2003.

La Alianza de Bioversity International y el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical 
(CIAT)  agradece a los comités municipales, a las asociaciones de productores, industrias, 
comercializadoras, entidades de educación, organizaciones no gubernamentales, 
agencias de cooperación internacional, centros de investigación, y demás actores 
públicos y privados que hacen parte o apoyan al gremio cacaotero del Caquetá, por su 
participación en la construcción de la presente estrategia para la sostenibilidad de la 
cadena de cacao del departamento.
El presente documento es el resultado de un trabajo participativo que deja de manifiesto 
la voluntad y el compromiso de los actores regionales en la búsqueda de una agricultura 
sostenible para la Amazonia colombiana. De este modo, la siguiente estrategia presenta 
un plan de acción, que se fundamenta en la proposición concertada de objetivos y 
acciones estratégicas que buscan contribuir al cierre de brechas de competitividad de 
la cadena y, a su vez, resaltar la importancia del cultivo del cacao en el posconflicto, y 
como una alternativa que favorece la recuperación y conservación de los bosques en 
plantaciones agroforestales. 
La construcción de esta estrategia fue financiada por el proyecto 18_III_106_
COL_M_Estrategias productivas sostenibles, “Implementando sistemas productivos 
sostenibles agrícolas y pecuarios para simultáneamente alcanzar la conservación 
de los bosques para la mitigación del cambio climático (REDD+) y la construcción 
de la paz en Colombia”, que forma parte de la Iniciativa Climática Internacional (IKI) y 
las iniciativas de investigación de CGIAR “Sistemas de Innovación Agroalimentaria 
Resilientes en América Latina y el Caribe (AgriLAC Resiliente)” y “Low-Emission Food 
Systems (Mitigate+)”. El Ministerio Federal Alemán de Medio Ambiente, Conservación de 
la Naturaleza y Seguridad Nuclear (BMU, por sus siglas en alemán) apoyó esta iniciativa 
sobre la base de una decisión adoptada por el Bundestag alemán.

En 2016, el Gobierno nacional y las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de 
Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP) firmaron un acuerdo de paz, 
que incluye objetivos importantes relacionados con el desarrollo rural 
sostenible de las zonas afectadas por el conflicto armado. Además, el 
Gobierno ha expresado su compromiso con el Acuerdo de París, las Metas 
Aichi y la Iniciativa 20x20 de restauración de tierras. Estas prioridades 
nacionales implican facilitar los usos sostenibles del suelo y las prácticas de 
gestión sostenible de la tierra como parte integral para superar el conflicto 
armado que ha afrontado el país durante los últimos 50 años, y contribuir a 
la consolidación de la paz en las zonas rurales de Colombia. Para hacerlo, es 
necesario el desarrollo de sistemas sostenibles de uso del suelo (SLUS, por 
sus siglas en inglés) y estrategias de mejora de cadenas de valor adaptadas 
a contextos específicos, típicamente presentes en áreas de conflicto y 
posconflicto. 
Este enfoque está estrechamente alineado con las actividades que en 
Colombia se han priorizado en las estrategias de cambio climático y 
construcción de paz, así como en el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo (PND) 2022–
2026 que plantea metas para contrarestar la deforestación y fomentar 
el desarrollo sostenible del sector primario a través de la transformación 
productiva y la acción climática. El presente documento representa la 
estrategia para la sostenibilidad de la cadena de cacao en el departamento 
del Caquetá, como resultado del trabajo colaborativo entre el proyecto 
“Implementando sistemas productivos sostenibles agrícolas y pecuarios 
para simultáneamente alcanzar la conservación de los bosques para la 
mitigación del cambio climático (REDD+) y la construcción de la paz en 
Colombia”, en adelante proyecto SLUS, y las iniciativas de investigación 
de CGIAR Sistemas de Innovación Agroalimentaria Resilientes en América 
Latina y el Caribe (AgriLAC Resiliente) y Low-Emission Food Systems 
(Mitigate+).
A nivel internacional, el Proyecto1 está alineado con las discusiones globales 
para reducir las emisiones de la agricultura, la silvicultura y otros usos 
de la tierra (AFOLU, por sus siglas en inglés) y las iniciativas globales para 
1 En este documento, el término “Proyecto” se utilizará de manera genérica para hacer referencia a la 
colaboración entre el proyecto SLUS y las iniciativas de CGIAR AgriLAC Resiliente y Mitigate+.
Resumen ejecutivo
Page 13:
restaurar los paisajes como, por ejemplo, la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio 
Climático (CMNUCC) y el Desafío de Bonn, respectivamente. A nivel nacional, la iniciativa se fundamenta 
en el desarrollo de acciones para contribuir en la reducción de emisiones asociadas al uso del suelo, la 
conservación de los bosques, la restauración de paisajes degradados y la construcción de paz en zonas 
rurales afectadas por el conflicto armado. 
Para Colombia y el departamento del Caquetá, el cacao se ha perfilado como un cultivo con potencial para 
hacer frente a los retos derivados de la firma del acuerdo de paz entre el Gobierno nacional y las FARC-
EP , y a problemas regionales de deforestación y degradación ambiental. En primera instancia, porque 
los procesos asociativos, producto de la organización entre cultivadores, se pueden configurar como 
escenarios de creación de capital social y redes de contacto esenciales en escenarios de posconflicto; y 
en segunda instancia, porque el establecimiento de cultivos bajo sistemas agroforestales (SAF) representa 
un potencial para el desarrollo de prácticas productivas sostenibles en términos de recuperación de 
bosques (Castro-Nunez et al., 2020; Charry et al., 2019, 2017).
Esta estrategia es el resultado de un proceso de construcción participativa entre los actores de la 
cadena departamental del cacao, con la orientación de la Alianza de Bioversity International y el Centro 
Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT). El enfoque metodológico requirió la realización de reuniones y 
talleres para identificar, analizar y priorizar las brechas que limitan la cadena en términos de sostenibilidad 
y competitividad. Así, el documento concluye en un plan de mejoramiento validado por el Comité 
Departamental de la Cadena del Cacao del Caquetá, respecto a la capacidad de respuesta institucional y 
la inclusión de elementos orientados a la persecución de objetivos comunes. 
Es importante resaltar que el plan de acción de la cadena tiene como principal pilar una visión conjunta 
proyectada al año 2032, la cual se articula con la visión 2040 del sector agropecuario del Departamento. 
Asimismo, responde a los requerimientos de la Ley 811 de 2003, que establece los lineamientos para la 
inscripción de cadenas productivas ante el Ministerio de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (MinAgricultura), 
y demanda enfocarse en los siguientes nueve puntos: i) productividad y competitividad; ii) desarrollo de 
mercado de bienes y factores de la cadena; iii) disminución de costos de transacción; iv) desarrollo de 
alianzas estratégicas; v) transferencia de información entre los agentes de la cadena; vi) vinculación de 
pequeños productores y empresarios; vii) manejo de recursos naturales y medio ambiente; viii) formación 
de recursos humanos; y ix) investigación y desarrollo tecnológico.
Además, el documento presenta un análisis de los costos de producción del cultivo e incluye la descripción 
de los actores (macro, meso y micro) que participan del encadenamiento, así como la manera en la que 
fomentan la adopción de sistemas y prácticas sostenibles del uso de la tierra desde el cumplimiento de 
su objeto social. Al respecto, se resalta el interés conjunto en el desarrollo sostenible y en trabajar por los 
compromisos regionales para mitigar los impactos del cambio climático y fomentar la paz territorial. Esta 
situación resalta la progresiva configuración de un escenario departamental favorable para la generación 
de sinergias institucionales y el desarrollo de iniciativas que beneficien al subsector cacaotero; por 
ejemplo, en el establecimiento del cultivo de cacao bajo SAF como alternativa de ingresos para los 
campesinos y como estrategia que contribuye a la recuperación de áreas deforestadas. Por último, se 
exponen conclusiones y recomendaciones que se espera sirvan de insumo para que el Gobierno nacional, 
las organizaciones de productores, la industria y, en general, todo el ecosistema productivo que rodea la 
cadena en el Departamento avancen de manera satisfactoria en la implementación del plan de acción.

|       Estrategia para la sostenibilidad de la cadena de cacao en CaquetáINTRODUCCIÓN
1.1. Antecedentes
Objetivo y resultados esperados
El Gobierno de Colombia se ha comprometido con diferentes iniciativas globales 
como el Acuerdo de París, las Metas Aichi y el Desafío Bonn para contribuir con 
las metas globales de mitigación del cambio climático. Por lo cual, (1) formuló la 
estrategia REDD+ (ENREDD); (2) firmó la Declaración Conjunta de Interés en REDD+ 
con los Gobiernos de Alemania, Noruega y Reino Unido; (3) desarrolló un NAMA de 
ganadería; y (4) está comprometido a lograr algunas metas de la Iniciativa 20x20 
para la restauración de paisajes. 
La presente estrategia se desarrolló con el objeto de contribuir a la reducción 
de emisiones relacionadas con el uso de la tierra, la conservación de bosques, 
la restauración de paisajes degradados, la mejora de los medios de vida rural, 
y la construcción de paz en zonas rurales de Colombia. La iniciativa se dirigió a 
agricultores ubicados en áreas relevantes para el almacenamiento de carbono y 
la restauración de tierras, y que a su vez vivan en zonas que han sido afectadas 
por el conflicto armado, problemática que ha contribuido a la generación de 
impactos ambientales.

Ruta hacia la acción climática y la construcción de paz     |        Para el desarrollo del Proyecto, fueron priorizadas las cadenas productivas de cacao y de ganadería doble 
propósito en los departamentos del Cesar y Caquetá. La población rural de estos departamentos afronta 
grandes retos en lo que respecta a la mitigación y la adaptación de los efectos del cambio climático. En 
cuanto al Cesar, es una región donde la restauración del paisaje es clave en la agenda nacional, mientras 
que el Caquetá se considera como una de las regiones con las tasas más altas de deforestación, lo que 
lo ubica como un departamento estratégico para las iniciativas relacionadas a la mitigación del cambio 
climático a través de la reducción de la deforestación.
Adicionalmente, son departamentos donde se presentaron hechos de violencia con víctimas y desplazados, 
especialmente en el área rural. En la actualidad, son territorios donde se reconstruye el tejido social a través de 
diferentes procesos de construcción de paz territorial, los cuales han sido favorecidos con administraciones 
y entidades locales que han generado un entorno favorable para la gestión de oportunidades y organizaciones 
que se encuentran cooperando con el desarrollo rural y ambiental de la región.
El cacao fue seleccionado porque es un cultivo comercial importante en la economía agrícola del país; 
además, ha sido promovido por el Gobierno de Colombia como una herramienta para construir paz. Estimar 
las emisiones de carbono en las áreas productoras es un esfuerzo que se debe realizar para identificar la 
interacción de las prácticas desarrolladas en el cultivo y la generación de gases de efecto invernadero (GEI) 
liberados en el proceso productivo. La estimación de las emisiones de GEI permite hacer un diagnóstico 
de los efectos de la actividad humana sobre la atmósfera y generar información necesaria para reducir 
los niveles de contaminación global. Asimismo, al promover modelos agroforestales con cacao, se está 
favoreciendo la reducción de la deforestación y por tanto la mitigación al cambio climático.

|       Estrategia para la sostenibilidad de la cadena de cacao en CaquetáLos resultados a largo plazo del proyecto se definen con respecto a las siguientes prioridades nacionales: 
1) Mitigación del cambio climático:  la reducción de las emisiones de GEI del sector AFOLU se 
logrará fomentando la adopción de SLUS, destinados a reducir las emisiones de la deforestación 
y promover la restauración del paisaje, y la reducción de la intensidad de las emisiones de los 
sistemas de producción de cacao. De este modo, el proyecto busca diseñar sistemas de uso 
sostenible del suelo que permitan su extrapolación a otras regiones. 
2) Consolidación de la paz: se abordará con la contribución del proyecto a mejorar los medios de 
vida y la cohesión social, mediante la introducción de procesos participativos para involucrar a la 
población local en el desarrollo y evaluación de SLUS y estrategias de mejora de cadenas de valor, 
incluidos los mecanismos de incentivos para la adopción de SLUS. 
3) Producción agrícola y ganadera sostenible:  consiste en la expansión de los sistemas de 
producción sostenible que mantengan o incluso aumenten la cobertura forestal en la finca y, por 
lo tanto, a nivel del paisaje, se desarrollará con base en indicadores de desempeño biofísicos, 
sociales, económicos y de mercado. Este enfoque integrado contribuirá a mejorar la resiliencia 
social, ambiental y ecológica de las regiones frente a los cambios ambientales globales.
4) Generación de cobeneficios relacionados con la biodiversidad y el agua: estos beneficios se 
obtendrán al reducir la presión sobre las áreas boscosas; otros, surgirán de la incorporación de 
sistemas agrícolas y ganaderos sostenibles en las cadenas de valor alimentarias locales, por 
ejemplo, sistemas agroforestales y silvopastoriles. 
5) Compromiso de actores de múltiples niveles:  la participación de los grupos de i","9812"

Module 4 of CGIAR's Climate Impact Platform focuses on driving change within global climate processes, a mission 
that closely aligns with Function 3 of the Platform aimed at enhancing the external visibility of CGIAR's climate 
science expertise.  
The 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27) was a pivotal moment in advancing the implementation of the 
Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA)  process. Decision 3/CP.27 , adopted during COP27, marked a 
significant step forward in addressing climate action in agriculture and food security.  
Established during COP23 in Fiji in 2017, the KJWA recognized  the critical role of agriculture in combating climate 
change. It initiated a new process within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
to facilitate discussions and actions related to agriculture.  
The recent adoption of decision 3/CP.27  at COP27 signifies the commencement of the four -year Sharm el -Sheikh 
joint work. This initiative builds upon the foundation laid by the KJWA and integrates past activities addressing 
agricultural issues under the UNFCCC framework, including references ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). It aims to advance the 
implementation of climate actions in agriculture and food security, elevating these crucial issues to the forefront of 
global climate efforts.  
 CGIAR’s Climate Impact Platform is crucial  in amplifying CGIAR's impact on climate research. It synthesizes 
achievements, raises CGIAR's profile in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
processes, contributes to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports,  and supports global 
strategies. Moreover, the Platform actively engages in the climate finance space.  
Collaborating with the Global Partnership and Advocacy Function, the Platform contributed to climate 
negotiations. This includes submissions to the Sharm El Sheikh Joint Work on Agriculture, an informal note to 
negotiators, a policy brief, and a blog  on Global Goals on Adaptation. Notably, the Global Goals on Adaptation 
final text reflects content circulated to negotiators, as indicated by rapid thematic analysis (RTA).

ecosystem -based adaptation, and avoid mitigation 
measures that damage ecosystems.  
(e) Increasing the resilience of infrastructure and human 
settlements to climate change impacts to ensure basic 
and continuous essential services for all and minimizing 
climate -related impacts on infrastructure and human 
settlements;  Ensure resilience of cities, settlements and key 
infrastructure to climate change by 2040, including by 
considering climate change impacts and risks in the design 
and planning of all human settlements and infrastructure, 
and substantially increasing deploy ment of integrated 
social, ecological and grey/physical infrastructure that 
reduces vulnerability of people, especially in informal 
settlements and coastal settlements.  
(f) Substantially reducing the adverse effects of climate 
change on poverty eradication and livelihoods in 
particular by promoting the use of adaptive social 
protection measures for all.  Increase resilience and substantially reduce adverse 
climate impacts on livelihoods as a share of a country’s 
total population by 2040, including through integrating 
climate change adaptation into social protection 
programmes supported by basic services an d 
infrastructure.  
(g) Protecting cultural heritage from the impacts of 
climate -related risks by developing adaptive strategies 
for preserving cultural practices and heritage sites and by 
designing climate -resilient infrastructure, guided by 
traditional knowledge, Indigenous  Peoples’ knowledge 
and local knowledge systems.
