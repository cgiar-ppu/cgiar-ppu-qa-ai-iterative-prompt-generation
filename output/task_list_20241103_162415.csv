"37","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

"37","NUTRITION_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, and food security. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has set specific objectives to address global challenges in nutrition, health, and food security, aiming to improve the well-being of populations in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a nutrition, health, and food security impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for nutrition, health, or food security.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering its impact on nutrition or food security.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on food availability, indirectly supporting food security.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing malnutrition in rural communities by improving access to nutritious foods.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Ending Hunger:** Enabling affordable, healthy diets for the 3 billion people who do not currently have access to safe and nutritious food.
- **Reducing Illness:** Decreasing cases of foodborne illness (600 million annually) and zoonotic diseases (1 billion annually) by one-third.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “malnutrition,” “food security,” or “public health.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, and food security.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If nutrition, health, or food security are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that nutrition, health, or food security objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a nutrition, health, and food security tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Nutrition","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

"37","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Environment","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

"1006","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.

The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT has extensive experience in using seasonal climate forecasts to improve the management of annual crops (e.g., variety selection, planting time, etc.), but there is limited experience with perennial cropping systems such as cocoa. To this end, we aim to understand which management decisions can benefit from seasonal climate forecasts, which climate variables would require good forecasting skills, and how forecasts need to be translated and communicated to end- users. To achieve this goal, the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT is applying human-centered design (HCD), a creative and participatory approach to problem-solving that allows for a deep understanding of the people for whom we design and the environments in which they live.

The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT has extensive experience in using seasonal climate forecasts to improve the management of annual crops (e.g., variety selection, planting time, etc.), but there is limited experience with perennial cropping systems such as cocoa. To this end, we aim to understand which management decisions can benefit from seasonal climate forecasts, which climate variables would require good forecasting skills, and how forecasts need to be translated and communicated to end- users. To achieve this goal, the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT is applying human-centered design (HCD), a creative and participatory approach to problem-solving that allows for a deep understanding of the people for whom we design and the environments in which they live. Stakeholders are considered co-designers in the process of creating solutions or tools, whether digital or non-digital.

 1. Introduction  
 
Brachiaria ( Urochloa  spp.) and Panicum grasses ( Megathyrsus  spp.) are two important 
tropical forage species indigenous to Africa that are widely cultivated in Africa, South America, 
Australia and East Asia and have demonstrated success in transforming beef and dairy 
industries. They are perennial, fast growing wit h high biomass production potential, palatable 
and nutritious to livestock. They possess large root systems, fix carbon in soils, and are 
adapted to drought and a wide variety of soils, tolerant to shade, waterlogging and to pests 
and diseases. Brachiaria and Panicum grasses are extensively used for grazing, cut -and-carry, 
and silage and hay production. Improved cultivars are high yielding, responsive to fertilizer 
applications, persistent and can remain green long into the dry season.   
 
Multi-locational a gronomic and farmer participatory evaluation of the performance of 
resilient and drought adapted forage cultivars and hybrids will identify best options for the 
different regions and livestock systems in the country. Validation at farmers’ fields (e.g., as  
part of Farmer Field Schools) will increase awareness and provide information of the impact 
on animal productivity and environmental indicators. Seed availability will be increased by 
seed multiplication by government institutions (such as IER), private s ector and farmers. This 
will lead to an increased adoption of these materials and improve productivity and income of 
households keeping small ruminants.  
This report presents the preliminary results of the forage trials in Mali  implemented by 
l’Instititut d’Economie Rurale (IER ) as part of the CGIAR Research Initiative on Sustainable 
Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender inclusion (SAPLING) .

 Management  
 
• Sowing: At onset of rains (direct seeding ), July 2023  
• Basal F ertilizer :  Fertilizer was applied at the rate of 100:60:30 kg N: P 2O5: K2O / ha.  
• Top dressing fertilizer: After 12 weeks after the establishment, nitrogenous fertilizer  was 
applied  at a rate of 100 kg N/ha in two equal split doses.  
• The weeds were removed manually from the plots.  
• No control of p ests and diseases  takes place . 
 
Data collection  
 
The following data are collected:  
• Rainfall, temperature (mean maximum and minimum) and relative humidity data in 
monthly basis from the nearest meteorological station for entire experimental period.  
• To maintain uniformity on the initial growth among forage species/ cultivars tested 
perform standardization cut at six weeks of germination by cutting 5 cm above the ground 
level.  
• Plant population : Plants are counted  within a 1m x 1m frame, randomly place d over the 2 
central rows at 4 weeks interval during establishment phase and at 8 weeks interval during 
the production phase.  
• Plant height : Similarly measure the height of 4 plants within the 1 x 1 m frame at the same 
interval as tiller numbers above.  
• Pest s and diseases : Assess pests and diseases incidences and record data every month 
throughout the experimental period. It is advisable to take the digital photographs of pest 
and diseases in each forage species /cultivars.  
• Dry matter yield : The first dry mat ter yield is taken at maturity from 2 x 2 m2 net harvest 
area per plot, harvested fresh material  is weighed  and sub-samples are collected and dr ied 
at 105oC for 48 hours for dry weight determination. Subsequent harvests are conducted 
after every 8 weeks.  
• Analysis of nutritive values : Each forage species/cultivar evaluated are subjected to 
nutritive value analysis including Crude Protein (CP), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid 
Detergent Fiber (ADF), Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL), Metabolizable Energy (ME), A sh, 
Calcium (Ca), Phosphorus (P) and others. For this purpose, herbage collected from 8 weeks 
harvest in wet and dry season of a year is used.

 3. Results  
 
The following table s show pictures of the three different research sites taken in the same 
week of 18 December 2023 and five months after planting.  Differences between the different 
sites are considerable, especially but not surprisingly between the Barouéli site on the one 
hand and the Farakala en Sotuba sites on the other.

Not performing well at any of the sites , ranked last in Farakala . We saw the same at the Ghana 
sites whereas at the Senegal sites the C. juncea performed very well. At the Sotuba site a local 
Crotalaria  showed good performance. According to literature, soil type and Ph should not be a 
constraint, but low soil fertility (P) might be a main cause for the poor performance in Mali and 
Ghana, Senegal  site probably having higher soil fertility because of residual nutrients from former 
crops.

4. Conclusions and next steps  
 
• This report  is entirely based on visual observations and farmers  evaluations. A second 
report with the  analysis of the  agronomic data will be made available early 2024.  
• The observations and farmer evaluations were conducted  at five months after planting 
and approximately two months into the dry season.  They will be repeated in approx. 
three (mid dry season) and six months (end dry season).  
• In the drier region (Barouéli) the Bracharia/Urochloa gras ses are preferred over  the 
Panicum / Megathyrsus materials , whereas the more humid region (Farakala ) shows the 
opposite . This might change as the dry season progresses  and the Panicum grasses are 
likely to also suffer more in the more humid zone.  
• There see m to be good p erspectives for some of the hybrids ( especially Cobra, Talisman, 
Camello ). Farmers like their adaptation to drought and, in particular for Cobra, their 
suitability for use as a cut -and-carry feed.

 1. Introduction  
 
Brachiaria ( Urochloa  spp.) and Panicum grasses ( Megathyrsus  spp.) are two important 
tropical forage species indigenous to Africa that are widely cultivated in Africa, South America, 
Australia and East Asia and have demonstrated success in transforming beef and dairy 
industries. They are perennial, fast growing wit h high biomass production potential, palatable 
and nutritious to livestock. They possess large root systems, fix carbon in soils, and are 
adapted to drought and a wide variety of soils, tolerant to shade, waterlogging and to pests 
and diseases. Brachiaria and Panicum grasses are extensively used for grazing, cut -and-carry, 
and silage and hay production. Improved cultivars are high yielding, responsive to fertilizer 
applications, persistent and can remain green long into the dry season.   
 
Multi-locational a gronomic and farmer participatory evaluation of the performance of 
resilient and drought adapted forage cultivars and hybrids will identify best options for the 
different regions and livestock systems in the country. Validation at farmers’ fields (e.g., as  
part of Farmer Field Schools) will increase awareness and provide information of the impact 
on animal productivity and environmental indicators. Seed availability will be increased by 
seed multiplication by government institutions (such as IER), private s ector and farmers. This 
will lead to an increased adoption of these materials and improve productivity and income of 
households keeping small ruminants.  
This report presents the preliminary results of the forage trials in Mali  implemented by 
l’Instititut d’Economie Rurale (IER ) as part of the CGIAR Research Initiative on Sustainable 
Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender inclusion (SAPLING) . 
 
Key elements:  
• Resilient and drought adapted forage cultivars and hy brids  (Urochloa , Megathyrsus , 
Crotalaria, etc) for their scaling up.  
• Evidence of improved forages and food -feed varieties and ‘food rations generated”.  
• Training for forage seed producers

• This report  is entirely based on visual observations and farmers  evaluations. A second 
report with the  analysis of the  agronomic data will be made available early 2024.  
• The observations and farmer evaluations were conducted  at five months after planting 
and approximately two months into the dry season.  They will be repeated in approx. 
three (mid dry season) and six months (end dry season).  
• In the drier region (Barouéli) the Bracharia/Urochloa gras ses are preferred over  the 
Panicum / Megathyrsus materials , whereas the more humid region (Farakala ) shows the 
opposite . This might change as the dry season progresses  and the Panicum grasses are 
likely to also suffer more in the more humid zone.  
• There see m to be good p erspectives for some of the hybrids ( especially Cobra, Talisman, 
Camello ). Farmers like their adaptation to drought and, in particular for Cobra, their 
suitability for use as a cut -and-carry feed.

 1. Introduction  
 
Brachiaria ( Urochloa  spp.) and Panicum grasses ( Megathyrsus  spp.) are two important 
tropical forage species indigenous to Africa that are widely cultivated in Africa, South America, 
Australia and East Asia and have demonstrated success in transforming beef and dairy 
industries. They are perennial, fast growing wit h high biomass production potential, palatable 
and nutritious to livestock. They possess large root systems, fix carbon in soils, and are 
adapted to drought and a wide variety of soils, tolerant to shade, waterlogging and to pests 
and diseases. Brachiaria and Panicum grasses are extensively used for grazing, cut -and-carry, 
and silage and hay production. Improved cultivars are high yielding, responsive to fertilizer 
applications, persistent and can remain green long into the dry season.   
 
Multi-locational a gronomic and farmer participatory evaluation of the performance of 
resilient and drought adapted forage cultivars and hybrids will identify best options for the 
different regions and livestock systems in the country. Validation at farmers’ fields (e.g., as  
part of Farmer Field Schools) will increase awareness and provide information of the impact 
on animal productivity and environmental indicators. Seed availability will be increased by 
seed multiplication by government institutions (such as IER), private s ector and farmers. This 
will lead to an increased adoption of these materials and improve productivity and income of 
households keeping small ruminants.  
This report presents the preliminary results of the forage trials in Mali  implemented by 
l’Instititut d’Economie Rurale (IER ) as part of the CGIAR Research Initiative on Sustainable 
Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender inclusion (SAPLING) . 
 
Key elements:  
• Resilient and drought adapted forage cultivars and hy brids  (Urochloa , Megathyrsus , 
Crotalaria, etc) for their scaling up.  
• Evidence of improved forages and food -feed varieties and ‘food rations generated”.  
• Training for forage seed producers

 2. Methodology  
 
Treatments and experimental design  
 
The initial evaluations of forage cultivars are carried out at three sites:  
1. Barouéli (Ségou region) , rainfall 500 mm. from June to September  
2. Farakala (Sikasso region) , rainfall 1000 mm, from May to September  
3. The IER Research Station (Sotuba , Bamako ), rainfall 750 mm, from May to September  
 
The performance of forage species/cultivars is also  assessed by the farmers and other 
stakeholders visiting the experimental plots at different stages (e.g., at establishment, full 
vegetative stage and maturity), and  the preferred technology will be identified for on -farm 
evaluation as outreach research activities.  
 
Number of treatments : 11 improved forage cultivars and hybrids, and 2 local forages.

 Management  
 
• Sowing: At onset of rains (direct seeding ), July 2023  
• Basal F ertilizer :  Fertilizer was applied at the rate of 100:60:30 kg N: P 2O5: K2O / ha.  
• Top dressing fertilizer: After 12 weeks after the establishment, nitrogenous fertilizer  was 
applied  at a rate of 100 kg N/ha in two equal split doses.  
• The weeds were removed manually from the plots.  
• No control of p ests and diseases  takes place . 
 
Data collection  
 
The following data are collected:  
• Rainfall, temperature (mean maximum and minimum) and relative humidity data in 
monthly basis from the nearest meteorological station for entire experimental period.  
• To maintain uniformity on the initial growth among forage species/ cultivars tested 
perform standardization cut at six weeks of germination by cutting 5 cm above the ground 
level.  
• Plant population : Plants are counted  within a 1m x 1m frame, randomly place d over the 2 
central rows at 4 weeks interval during establishment phase and at 8 weeks interval during 
the production phase.  
• Plant height : Similarly measure the height of 4 plants within the 1 x 1 m frame at the same 
interval as tiller numbers above.  
• Pest s and diseases : Assess pests and diseases incidences and record data every month 
throughout the experimental period. It is advisable to take the digital photographs of pest 
and diseases in each forage species /cultivars.  
• Dry matter yield : The first dry mat ter yield is taken at maturity from 2 x 2 m2 net harvest 
area per plot, harvested fresh material  is weighed  and sub-samples are collected and dr ied 
at 105oC for 48 hours for dry weight determination. Subsequent harvests are conducted 
after every 8 weeks.  
• Analysis of nutritive values : Each forage species/cultivar evaluated are subjected to 
nutritive value analysis including Crude Protein (CP), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid 
Detergent Fiber (ADF), Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL), Metabolizable Energy (ME), A sh, 
Calcium (Ca), Phosphorus (P) and others. For this purpose, herbage collected from 8 weeks 
harvest in wet and dry season of a year is used.

 3. Results  
 
The following table s show pictures of the three different research sites taken in the same 
week of 18 December 2023 and five months after planting.  Differences between the different 
sites are considerable, especially but not surprisingly between the Barouéli site on the one 
hand and the Farakala en Sotuba sites on the other.   
 
Barouéli  Farakala  Sotuba  
   
Andropogon gayanus  
Performing well in both Farakala (ranked 6th by farmers) and S otuba, regular in Barouéli  
 
  
  
 
Crotalaria juncea  
Not performing well at any of the sites , ranked last in Farakala . We saw the same at the Ghana 
sites whereas at the Senegal sites the C. juncea performed very well. At the Sotuba site a local 
Crotalaria  showed good performance. According to literature, soil type and Ph should not be a 
constraint, but low soil fertility (P) might be a main cause for the poor performance in Mali and 
Ghana, Senegal  site probably having higher soil fertility because of residual nutrients from former 
crops.

 Barouéli  Farakala  Sotuba  
   
Megathyrsus maximus  cv ""Maasai""  
Performing quite well at all sites, ranked highest by farmers in Farakala , and ranked 4th in 
Barouéli  
   
Megathyrsus maximus  cv ""Mombasa""  
Poor performance in Barouéli, good performance in Farakala  (ranked 8th by farmers)  
   
Megathyrsus maximus  cv ""Mun River""

Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs 
and linked households for testing 
delivery of bundled technology packages 
in Tanzania  
James Rao, Immaculate Omondi, Jane Poole and Amos Omore
Key messages
• Designing and conducting the selection of 
agripreneurs and households to test delivery of 
bundled technology packages is complex given the 
many factors that need to be considered.
• Statistical matching technique was used to select 
agripreneurs (APs) and consequently leading to the 
identification of households that were likely to be 
linked to the APs and to producer organizations 
where the APs operated.
• The complexities of the selection of APs and 
households should be factored into the analysis 
as much as possible following an endline survey 
to include measuring the effect of Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of a 
technology package or a combination because 
different agripreneurs take up different baskets of 
interventions in different areas.Introduction
Maziwa Zaidi partners identified a set of integrated 
intervention packages (Omore et al. 2019) to be 
tested and delivered as part of the implementation 
of the project on ‘Agri-entrepreneurship, technology 
uptake and inclusive dairy development in T anzania.’ 
The testing and delivery were through empowered 
and appropriately skilled agripreneurs (APs) who were 
expected to also profit from promoting the uptake of the 
prioritized technology packages by smallholder dairy 
farmers linked to them. 
To achieve this aim, the capacity of the APs would be 
strengthened in selected agribusiness knowledge 
areas and skills by incubation service providers. This 
intervention included gender-responsive incubation, 
acceleration, training and mentoring of APs engaged 
in the provision of inputs and services in project sites.

among APs in relation to the delivery of services would 
be monitored in both intervention and control districts 
and wards qualitatively and quantitatively . Qualitative 
monitoring of outcomes would be conducted through 
knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) analysis 
guided by a theory of change developed at the onset. 
Quantitative monitoring would be done through 
baseline and endline surveys of APs and households  
to capture changes in the use of inputs and services by 
HHs linked to the capacitated APs.
This research brief summarizes 1) the methodology 
including the process of selecting APs and HHs and 
2) the results of the selection process. The selection 
process is summarized based on the baseline data 
available at this portal: Maziwa Zaidi/More Milk in 
T anzania (phase II) - Datasets - ILRI Datasets Portal .
 
This intervention included gender-responsive 
incubation, acceleration, training and mentoring of 
the agripreneurs engaged in the provision of inputs 
and services in project sites. The project sites were 
selected based on the need to align with ongoing 
development projects that could facilitate the 
uptake of technology packages  in Kilimanjaro and 
T anga regions of T anzania .
Methodology
Two regions, namely Kilimanjaro and T anga and 
four districts within them (Hai, Siha, Korogwe and 
Muheza) were selected based on the need to align 
with ongoing development projects that could 
facilitate the uptake of technology packages. Within 
each intervention, districts are wards with cattle 
keepers linked to the APs. The selected wards 
are geographically clustered around producer 
organizations (POs) also linked to the APs. Two 
control districts (Moshi Rural and Rombo) with similar 
production and market systems were also identified, 
both in the Kilimanjaro region. Project wards were 
identified by the overlap between the geographical 
catchment of cooperatives/POs and the geographical 
areas from where the project selected APs to draw 
their clients. From these overlapping areas, a random 
selection of wards was made. These are the project 
implementation areas. The selection of APs and HHs 
was carried out in three stages: scoping, selection of 
APs and identification of target HHs (Figure 1).Figure 1: Sampling of agripreneurs and households in treatment and 
control districts.
Stage 1: Scoping  
A scoping exercise was done in October and November 
2020 across the six districts to generate an initial long list 
of all APs in project sites and their networks, including 
the POs/cooperatives that they work with. Sampling 
was informed by the need to have enough to cover 
the diversity of APs and have a sufficiently long list from 
which to select about 50 APs across certain criteria in 
both intervention and control areas. The scoping relied 
on key informant interviews and a snowballing approach 
to generate the long list. 
A total of 57 key informants (mainly ward extension 
officers) and 51 respondents from POs were interviewed, 
through partners in the project implementation area. An 
expanded list of APs was generated from the interviews 
and further snowballed to identify all the APs in the project 
implementation site. This was done by first interviewing 
the identified informants and respondents, to generate 
information on APs in the area, then interviewing all the 
identified APs from the snowball sampling interviews.
 
From the 57 key informants and 51 respondents from 
POs, names of APs operating in the study sites were 
obtained and further names were generated from 
interviewing each of the identified APs from the list. This 
snowball sampling process generated a list of 427 APs. 
Out of this list, the goal was to interview all the listed APs 
who operated within the project implementation areas. 
Since the broader list contained some APs who operated 
outside the area and some who were unavailable due 
to changing their area of operation or other reasons, in 
total, 291 APs were interviewed.
The survey , using a structured survey tool, collected 
minimum data for characterizing these agripreneurs. Data 
on type of enterprises, gender of the entrepreneur, area 
of operation, products and services offered and training 
needs, was obtained. The data generated from the 
scoping survey was used to inform the second stage of 
the selection of those who would be invited to participate 
in the intervention or be part of the control group.

Initial data from the scoping study was used for the 
selection of intervention APs. The 291 APs were first 
scored based on the criteria listed below, including 
abbreviations in the data portal.
1. Type of business and level of bundling (breeding, 
animal health, agro-dealer, feed supplier, etc.)
2. Linkages that APs have with POs/cooperatives or 
overlap between the PO and AP at the ward level 
(AP_PO_overlap)
3. Scale of operation – clientele and the geographical 
location of most of their clients: 
• Number of wards covered by the AP ( ward 
rate )
• Service x product bundling 
(serv_prod_bundle )
• Total number of services ( prod_rate )
• Total number of products ( serv_rate )
4. Other characteristics:
• Gender ( AP_gender ),
• Age ( AP_youth )
These variables (highlighted above as they appear in 
the data portal) were used to score all APs and then 
in selection of the APs from the intervention districts 
that would be invited to participate in the incubation 
program. The baseline for APs was, however, 
conducted with all 291 APs in both intervention and 
control districts.

Each AP was scored on each criterion as summarized 
in T able 1, with a summation of scores across criteria 
yielding the AP selection score. This resulted in scores 
ranging from -4 to 5 with a score of 5 indicating high/
advanced level of business operation. T able 2 below 
shows how the APs were distributed across scores.T able 2: Distribution of APs by selection scores and intervention

About 50 out of the 193 APs in intervention districts 
were targeted for selection into the incubation program 
(a longer list of 60 per group was initially generated to 
allow for non-responses following a consent process). To 
ensure that APs of different business levels were selected 
while also targeting youth and women entrepreneurs, 
the targeted 60 APs were distributed across the different 
scores as shown in T able 3. The allocation per score is 
proportionate (approximately 30%)   to each score’ s 
representation in the distribution of the 193 APs in the 
intervention districts.

Given the foregoing, in March 2021, the CGIAR Research 
Program on Livestock (CRP Livestock) technology flagships 
comprising inputs/services groups (Animal Health, Feeds 
& Forages, and Genetics) were guided to use the data to 
select APs in the intervention  group who they thought 
would benefit from the incubation program and achieve 
improved inputs/services and project goals based on a 
given criterion developed from analysis of the scoping 
data. This was done mainly to ensure that selected APs 
cut across different business levels and avoided deliberate 
bias towards including women and youth.

HHs keeping dairy cattle was also compiled and 
combined with the list of cooperative members to 
generate a comprehensive list of dairy HHs in the wards. 
Finally , dairy HHs in the selected wards were selected 
(including non-cooperative members where possible) 
and surveyed. These dairy HHs represent the target HH-
level population for the project.
Results 
T able 4 shows how APs offered for selection are 
distributed across the scores. The aim was to ensure 
that selected APs as per the Livestock CRP flagships cut 
across different business levels, adhering to the women 
and youth representation as indicated. We targeted 
having about 50 APs for incubation, with an additional 10 
APs to start with in case of dropouts or lack of willingness 
to participate. 
T able 5 summarizes the selection of APs by district, 
including additional APs in case of dropouts or 
unwillingness to participate in incubation. It shows the 
distribution of the 60 APs across the different scores of 
levels of the business scale. The 60 APs were invited to 
participate. Finally , 50 participated in the incubation 
process including visioning, boot camp, mentoring and 
coaching.

The HH survey interviewed 713 HHs from 24 wards 
(12 intervention and 12 control) where there were 
cooperative and non-cooperative HHs (in some cases 
we could not get the non-cooperative or the cooperative 
members). The distribution of HHs by ward and district is

After identification of matched APs in both intervention 
and control areas, the POs/cooperatives linked to them 
were listed. If not already obtained, data on cooperative 
members and their wards was collected. Wards were 
identified around the POs/cooperatives that represent 
common areas of both APs’ coverage and POs/
cooperative members. It is useful to note that not all APs 
were expected to be linked to these POs/cooperatives, 
but the majority are expected to be linked. Those not 
linked are likely working in the same geographical areas. 
These wards of overlap between PO membership and 
AP operation formed the longer list of wards, from 
which a random selection of survey wards was drawn. 
The wards had to have at least eight APs who indicated 
they work in them or at least one PO operating in the 
area (three wards in Rombo were excluded because 
there were no reported POs covering the areas). These 
became project implementation areas. The number of 
wards was balanced according to the HH-level sample 
size calculations during analysis (see below).

ilri.orgDiscussion and next steps
Designing and conducting a social experiment like this 
one presented here is complex given the many factors 
that need to be considered. The complexities will need 
to be factored into the analysis as much as possible 
following an end-line survey . At a basic level, the analysis 
would include measuring the effect of the Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of technology 
package or a combination given the expectation that 
different APs will take up different baskets of interventions 
and that in control areas, APs may have single or 
combination of interventions which may or may not be 
the same. Similarly , there are APs in the intervention areas 
(but not with the project) who may have the same or 
other single or combination interventions and through 
the project may also receive information from their fellow 
project agripreneurs. 
The analysis will also need to consider the likelihood that 
we likely will be unable to evaluate effectively different 
baskets (or individual) technologies and their effects 
but expect to see quite a lot of variation which may be 
explored to look for trends and comparisons. There 
may also be different technologies in control areas than 
in intervention areas because of the actions of partners 
and/or government extension services. Further, we would need to factor observations of 
non-project agripreneurs in intervention districts to 
evaluate the effect of BDS without the confounding of 
technology . Another potential complication is measuring 
and isolating effects on farmers in intervention areas 
who are reached by other non-project APs that are not 
supported with BDS. It is very likely that we will have HHs 
in the project who indicate in the baseline that they are 
working with APs, but who are not part of the project. 
We will explore these issues while analysing the baseline 
and end-line data to deliberately extract these APs. The 
evaluation will also incorporate the parallel qualitative 
assessment of outcomes being conducted separately .

  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for nutrition, health, or food security.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering its impact on nutrition or food security.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on food availability, indirectly supporting food security.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing malnutrition in rural communities by improving access to nutritious foods.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Ending Hunger:** Enabling affordable, healthy diets for the 3 billion people who do not currently have access to safe and nutritious food.
- **Reducing Illness:** Decreasing cases of foodborne illness (600 million annually) and zoonotic diseases (1 billion annually) by one-third.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “malnutrition,” “food security,” or “public health.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, and food security.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If nutrition, health, or food security are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that nutrition, health, or food security objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a nutrition, health, and food security tag (0, 1, or 2).

to capture changes in the use of inputs and services by 
HHs linked to the capacitated APs.
This research brief summarizes 1) the methodology 
including the process of selecting APs and HHs and 
2) the results of the selection process. The selection 
process is summarized based on the baseline data 
available at this portal: Maziwa Zaidi/More Milk in 
T anzania (phase II) - Datasets - ILRI Datasets Portal .
 
This intervention included gender-responsive 
incubation, acceleration, training and mentoring of 
the agripreneurs engaged in the provision of inputs 
and services in project sites. The project sites were 
selected based on the need to align with ongoing 
development projects that could facilitate the 
uptake of technology packages  in Kilimanjaro and 
T anga regions of T anzania .
Methodology
Two regions, namely Kilimanjaro and T anga and 
four districts within them (Hai, Siha, Korogwe and 
Muheza) were selected based on the need to align 
with ongoing development projects that could 
facilitate the uptake of technology packages. Within 
each intervention, districts are wards with cattle 
keepers linked to the APs. The selected wards 
are geographically clustered around producer 
organizations (POs) also linked to the APs. Two 
control districts (Moshi Rural and Rombo) with similar 
production and market systems were also identified, 
both in the Kilimanjaro region. Project wards were 
identified by the overlap between the geographical 
catchment of cooperatives/POs and the geographical 
areas from where the project selected APs to draw 
their clients. From these overlapping areas, a random 
selection of wards was made. These are the project 
implementation areas. The selection of APs and HHs 
was carried out in three stages: scoping, selection of 
APs and identification of target HHs (Figure 1).Figure 1: Sampling of agripreneurs and households in treatment and 
control districts.
Stage 1: Scoping  
A scoping exercise was done in October and November 
2020 across the six districts to generate an initial long list 
of all APs in project sites and their networks, including 
the POs/cooperatives that they work with. Sampling 
was informed by the need to have enough to cover 
the diversity of APs and have a sufficiently long list from 
which to select about 50 APs across certain criteria in 
both intervention and control areas. The scoping relied 
on key informant interviews and a snowballing approach 
to generate the long list. 
A total of 57 key informants (mainly ward extension 
officers) and 51 respondents from POs were interviewed, 
through partners in the project implementation area. An 
expanded list of APs was generated from the interviews 
and further snowballed to identify all the APs in the project 
implementation site. This was done by first interviewing 
the identified informants and respondents, to generate 
information on APs in the area, then interviewing all the 
identified APs from the snowball sampling interviews.
 
From the 57 key informants and 51 respondents from 
POs, names of APs operating in the study sites were 
obtained and further names were generated from 
interviewing each of the identified APs from the list. This 
snowball sampling process generated a list of 427 APs. 
Out of this list, the goal was to interview all the listed APs 
who operated within the project implementation areas. 
Since the broader list contained some APs who operated 
outside the area and some who were unavailable due 
to changing their area of operation or other reasons, in 
total, 291 APs were interviewed.
The survey , using a structured survey tool, collected 
minimum data for characterizing these agripreneurs. Data 
on type of enterprises, gender of the entrepreneur, area 
of operation, products and services offered and training 
needs, was obtained. The data generated from the 
scoping survey was used to inform the second stage of 
the selection of those who would be invited to participate 
in the intervention or be part of the control group.

Initial data from the scoping study was used for the 
selection of intervention APs. The 291 APs were first 
scored based on the criteria listed below, including 
abbreviations in the data portal.
1. Type of business and level of bundling (breeding, 
animal health, agro-dealer, feed supplier, etc.)
2. Linkages that APs have with POs/cooperatives or 
overlap between the PO and AP at the ward level 
(AP_PO_overlap)
3. Scale of operation – clientele and the geographical 
location of most of their clients: 
• Number of wards covered by the AP ( ward 
rate )
• Service x product bundling 
(serv_prod_bundle )
• Total number of services ( prod_rate )
• Total number of products ( serv_rate )
4. Other characteristics:
• Gender ( AP_gender ),
• Age ( AP_youth )
These variables (highlighted above as they appear in 
the data portal) were used to score all APs and then 
in selection of the APs from the intervention districts 
that would be invited to participate in the incubation 
program. The baseline for APs was, however, 
conducted with all 291 APs in both intervention and 
control districts.

yielding the AP selection score. This resulted in scores 
ranging from -4 to 5 with a score of 5 indicating high/
advanced level of business operation. T able 2 below

About 50 out of the 193 APs in intervention districts 
were targeted for selection into the incubation program 
(a longer list of 60 per group was initially generated to 
allow for non-responses following a consent process). To 
ensure that APs of different business levels were selected 
while also targeting youth and women entrepreneurs, 
the targeted 60 APs were distributed across the different 
scores as shown in T able 3. The allocation per score is 
proportionate (approximately 30%)   to each score’ s 
representation in the distribution of the 193 APs in the 
intervention districts.

Given the foregoing, in March 2021, the CGIAR Research 
Program on Livestock (CRP Livestock) technology flagships 
comprising inputs/services groups (Animal Health, Feeds 
& Forages, and Genetics) were guided to use the data to 
select APs in the intervention  group who they thought 
would benefit from the incubation program and achieve 
improved inputs/services and project goals based on a 
given criterion developed from analysis of the scoping 
data. This was done mainly to ensure that selected APs 
cut across different business levels and avoided deliberate 
bias towards including women and youth.

HHs keeping dairy cattle was also compiled and 
combined with the list of cooperative members to 
generate a comprehensive list of dairy HHs in the wards. 
Finally , dairy HHs in the selected wards were selected 
(including non-cooperative members where possible) 
and surveyed. These dairy HHs represent the target HH-
level population for the project.

T able 4 shows how APs offered for selection are 
distributed across the scores. The aim was to ensure 
that selected APs as per the Livestock CRP flagships cut 
across different business levels, adhering to the women 
and youth representation as indicated. We targeted 
having about 50 APs for incubation, with an additional 10 
APs to start with in case of dropouts or lack of willingness 
to participate. 
T able 5 summarizes the selection of APs by district, 
including additional APs in case of dropouts or

levels of the business scale. The 60 APs were invited to 
participate. Finally , 50 participated in the incubation 
process including visioning, boot camp, mentoring and 
coaching.

After identification of matched APs in both intervention 
and control areas, the POs/cooperatives linked to them 
were listed. If not already obtained, data on cooperative 
members and their wards was collected. Wards were 
identified around the POs/cooperatives that represent 
common areas of both APs’ coverage and POs/
cooperative members. It is useful to note that not all APs 
were expected to be linked to these POs/cooperatives, 
but the majority are expected to be linked. Those not 
linked are likely working in the same geographical areas. 
These wards of overlap between PO membership and 
AP operation formed the longer list of wards, from 
which a random selection of survey wards was drawn. 
The wards had to have at least eight APs who indicated 
they work in them or at least one PO operating in the 
area (three wards in Rombo were excluded because 
there were no reported POs covering the areas). These 
became project implementation areas. The number of 
wards was balanced according to the HH-level sample 
size calculations during analysis (see below).

Designing and conducting a social experiment like this 
one presented here is complex given the many factors 
that need to be considered. The complexities will need 
to be factored into the analysis as much as possible 
following an end-line survey . At a basic level, the analysis 
would include measuring the effect of the Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of technology 
package or a combination given the expectation that 
different APs will take up different baskets of interventions 
and that in control areas, APs may have single or 
combination of interventions which may or may not be 
the same. Similarly , there are APs in the intervention areas 
(but not with the project) who may have the same or 
other single or combination interventions and through 
the project may also receive information from their fellow 
project agripreneurs. 
The analysis will also need to consider the likelihood that 
we likely will be unable to evaluate effectively different 
baskets (or individual) technologies and their effects 
but expect to see quite a lot of variation which may be 
explored to look for trends and comparisons. There 
may also be different technologies in control areas than 
in intervention areas because of the actions of partners 
and/or government extension services. Further, we would need to factor observations of 
non-project agripreneurs in intervention districts to 
evaluate the effect of BDS without the confounding of 
technology . Another potential complication is measuring 
and isolating effects on farmers in intervention areas 
who are reached by other non-project APs that are not 
supported with BDS. It is very likely that we will have HHs 
in the project who indicate in the baseline that they are 
working with APs, but who are not part of the project. 
We will explore these issues while analysing the baseline 
and end-line data to deliberately extract these APs. The 
evaluation will also incorporate the parallel qualitative 
assessment of outcomes being conducted separately .

Key messages
• Designing and conducting the selection of 
agripreneurs and households to test delivery of 
bundled technology packages is complex given the 
many factors that need to be considered.
• Statistical matching technique was used to select 
agripreneurs (APs) and consequently leading to the 
identification of households that were likely to be 
linked to the APs and to producer organizations 
where the APs operated.
• The complexities of the selection of APs and 
households should be factored into the analysis 
as much as possible following an endline survey 
to include measuring the effect of Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of a 
technology package or a combination because 
different agripreneurs take up different baskets of 
interventions in different areas.Introduction
Maziwa Zaidi partners identified a set of integrated 
intervention packages (Omore et al. 2019) to be 
tested and delivered as part of the implementation 
of the project on ‘Agri-entrepreneurship, technology 
uptake and inclusive dairy development in T anzania.’ 
The testing and delivery were through empowered 
and appropriately skilled agripreneurs (APs) who were 
expected to also profit from promoting the uptake of the 
prioritized technology packages by smallholder dairy 
farmers linked to them. 
To achieve this aim, the capacity of the APs would be 
strengthened in selected agribusiness knowledge 
areas and skills by incubation service providers. This 
intervention included gender-responsive incubation, 
acceleration, training and mentoring of APs engaged 
in the provision of inputs and services in project sites.

|       Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in TanzaniaFollowing the capacity building, changes in behaviour 
among APs in relation to the delivery of services would 
be monitored in both intervention and control districts 
and wards qualitatively and quantitatively . Qualitative 
monitoring of outcomes would be conducted through 
knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) analysis 
guided by a theory of change developed at the onset. 
Quantitative monitoring would be done through 
baseline and endline surveys of APs and households  
to capture changes in the use of inputs and services by 
HHs linked to the capacitated APs.
This research brief summarizes 1) the methodology 
including the process of selecting APs and HHs and 
2) the results of the selection process. The selection 
process is summarized based on the baseline data 
available at this portal: Maziwa Zaidi/More Milk in 
T anzania (phase II) - Datasets - ILRI Datasets Portal .
 
This intervention included gender-responsive 
incubation, acceleration, training and mentoring of 
the agripreneurs engaged in the provision of inputs 
and services in project sites. The project sites were 
selected based on the need to align with ongoing 
development projects that could facilitate the 
uptake of technology packages  in Kilimanjaro and 
T anga regions of T anzania .
Methodology
Two regions, namely Kilimanjaro and T anga and 
four districts within them (Hai, Siha, Korogwe and 
Muheza) were selected based on the need to align 
with ongoing development projects that could 
facilitate the uptake of technology packages. Within 
each intervention, districts are wards with cattle 
keepers linked to the APs. The selected wards 
are geographically clustered around producer 
organizations (POs) also linked to the APs. Two 
control districts (Moshi Rural and Rombo) with similar 
production and market systems were also identified, 
both in the Kilimanjaro region. Project wards were 
identified by the overlap between the geographical 
catchment of cooperatives/POs and the geographical 
areas from where the project selected APs to draw 
their clients. From these overlapping areas, a random 
selection of wards was made. These are the project 
implementation areas. The selection of APs and HHs 
was carried out in three stages: scoping, selection of 
APs and identification of target HHs (Figure 1).Figure 1: Sampling of agripreneurs and households in treatment and 
control districts.
Stage 1: Scoping  
A scoping exercise was done in October and November 
2020 across the six districts to generate an initial long list 
of all APs in project sites and their networks, including 
the POs/cooperatives that they work with. Sampling 
was informed by the need to have enough to cover 
the diversity of APs and have a sufficiently long list from 
which to select about 50 APs across certain criteria in 
both intervention and control areas. The scoping relied 
on key informant interviews and a snowballing approach 
to generate the long list. 
A total of 57 key informants (mainly ward extension 
officers) and 51 respondents from POs were interviewed, 
through partners in the project implementation area. An 
expanded list of APs was generated from the interviews 
and further snowballed to identify all the APs in the project 
implementation site. This was done by first interviewing 
the identified informants and respondents, to generate 
information on APs in the area, then interviewing all the 
identified APs from the snowball sampling interviews.
 
From the 57 key informants and 51 respondents from 
POs, names of APs operating in the study sites were 
obtained and further names were generated from 
interviewing each of the identified APs from the list. This 
snowball sampling process generated a list of 427 APs. 
Out of this list, the goal was to interview all the listed APs 
who operated within the project implementation areas. 
Since the broader list contained some APs who operated 
outside the area and some who were unavailable due 
to changing their area of operation or other reasons, in 
total, 291 APs were interviewed.
The survey , using a structured survey tool, collected 
minimum data for characterizing these agripreneurs. Data 
on type of enterprises, gender of the entrepreneur, area 
of operation, products and services offered and training 
needs, was obtained. The data generated from the 
scoping survey was used to inform the second stage of 
the selection of those who would be invited to participate 
in the intervention or be part of the control group.

Initial data from the scoping study was used for the 
selection of intervention APs. The 291 APs were first 
scored based on the criteria listed below, including 
abbreviations in the data portal.
1. Type of business and level of bundling (breeding, 
animal health, agro-dealer, feed supplier, etc.)
2. Linkages that APs have with POs/cooperatives or 
overlap between the PO and AP at the ward level 
(AP_PO_overlap)
3. Scale of operation – clientele and the geographical 
location of most of their clients: 
• Number of wards covered by the AP ( ward 
rate )
• Service x product bundling 
(serv_prod_bundle )
• Total number of services ( prod_rate )
• Total number of products ( serv_rate )
4. Other characteristics:
• Gender ( AP_gender ),
• Age ( AP_youth )
These variables (highlighted above as they appear in 
the data portal) were used to score all APs and then 
in selection of the APs from the intervention districts 
that would be invited to participate in the incubation 
program. The baseline for APs was, however, 
conducted with all 291 APs in both intervention and 
control districts.

Each AP was scored on each criterion as summarized 
in T able 1, with a summation of scores across criteria 
yielding the AP selection score. This resulted in scores 
ranging from -4 to 5 with a score of 5 indicating high/
advanced level of business operation. T able 2 below

About 50 out of the 193 APs in intervention districts 
were targeted for selection into the incubation program 
(a longer list of 60 per group was initially generated to 
allow for non-responses following a consent process). To 
ensure that APs of different business levels were selected 
while also targeting youth and women entrepreneurs, 
the targeted 60 APs were distributed across the different 
scores as shown in T able 3. The allocation per score is 
proportionate (approximately 30%)   to each score’ s 
representation in the distribution of the 193 APs in the 
intervention districts.

Given the foregoing, in March 2021, the CGIAR Research 
Program on Livestock (CRP Livestock) technology flagships 
comprising inputs/services groups (Animal Health, Feeds 
& Forages, and Genetics) were guided to use the data to 
select APs in the intervention  group who they thought 
would benefit from the incubation program and achieve 
improved inputs/services and project goals based on a 
given criterion developed from analysis of the scoping 
data. This was done mainly to ensure that selected APs 
cut across different business levels and avoided deliberate 
bias towards including women and youth.

|       Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in TanzaniaDuring the visit to the wards, a list of non-cooperative 
HHs keeping dairy cattle was also compiled and 
combined with the list of cooperative members to 
generate a comprehensive list of dairy HHs in the wards. 
Finally , dairy HHs in the selected wards were selected 
(including non-cooperative members where possible) 
and surveyed. These dairy HHs represent the target HH-
level population for the project.
Results 
T able 4 shows how APs offered for selection are 
distributed across the scores. The aim was to ensure 
that selected APs as per the Livestock CRP flagships cut 
across different business levels, adhering to the women 
and youth representation as indicated. We targeted 
having about 50 APs for incubation, with an additional 10 
APs to start with in case of dropouts or lack of willingness 
to participate. 
T able 5 summarizes the selection of APs by district, 
including additional APs in case of dropouts or 
unwillingness to participate in incubation. It shows the 
distribution of the 60 APs across the different scores of 
levels of the business scale. The 60 APs were invited to 
participate. Finally , 50 participated in the incubation 
process including visioning, boot camp, mentoring and 
coaching.

The HH survey interviewed 713 HHs from 24 wards 
(12 intervention and 12 control) where there were 
cooperative and non-cooperative HHs (in some cases 
we could not get the non-cooperative or the cooperative 
members). The distribution of HHs by ward and district is

After identification of matched APs in both intervention 
and control areas, the POs/cooperatives linked to them 
were listed. If not already obtained, data on cooperative 
members and their wards was collected. Wards were 
identified around the POs/cooperatives that represent 
common areas of both APs’ coverage and POs/
cooperative members. It is useful to note that not all APs 
were expected to be linked to these POs/cooperatives, 
but the majority are expected to be linked. Those not 
linked are likely working in the same geographical areas. 
These wards of overlap between PO membership and 
AP operation formed the longer list of wards, from 
which a random selection of survey wards was drawn. 
The wards had to have at least eight APs who indicated 
they work in them or at least one PO operating in the 
area (three wards in Rombo were excluded because 
there were no reported POs covering the areas). These 
became project implementation areas. The number of 
wards was balanced according to the HH-level sample 
size calculations during analysis (see below).

ilri.orgDiscussion and next steps
Designing and conducting a social experiment like this 
one presented here is complex given the many factors 
that need to be considered. The complexities will need 
to be factored into the analysis as much as possible 
following an end-line survey . At a basic level, the analysis 
would include measuring the effect of the Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of technology 
package or a combination given the expectation that 
different APs will take up different baskets of interventions 
and that in control areas, APs may have single or 
combination of interventions which may or may not be 
the same. Similarly , there are APs in the intervention areas 
(but not with the project) who may have the same or 
other single or combination interventions and through 
the project may also receive information from their fellow 
project agripreneurs. 
The analysis will also need to consider the likelihood that 
we likely will be unable to evaluate effectively different 
baskets (or individual) technologies and their effects 
but expect to see quite a lot of variation which may be 
explored to look for trends and comparisons. There 
may also be different technologies in control areas than 
in intervention areas because of the actions of partners 
and/or government extension services. Further, we would need to factor observations of 
non-project agripreneurs in intervention districts to 
evaluate the effect of BDS without the confounding of 
technology . Another potential complication is measuring 
and isolating effects on farmers in intervention areas 
who are reached by other non-project APs that are not 
supported with BDS. It is very likely that we will have HHs 
in the project who indicate in the baseline that they are 
working with APs, but who are not part of the project. 
We will explore these issues while analysing the baseline 
and end-line data to deliberately extract these APs. The 
evaluation will also incorporate the parallel qualitative 
assessment of outcomes being conducted separately .

"5569","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

"5569","NUTRITION_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, and food security. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has set specific objectives to address global challenges in nutrition, health, and food security, aiming to improve the well-being of populations in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a nutrition, health, and food security impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for nutrition, health, or food security.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering its impact on nutrition or food security.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on food availability, indirectly supporting food security.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing malnutrition in rural communities by improving access to nutritious foods.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Ending Hunger:** Enabling affordable, healthy diets for the 3 billion people who do not currently have access to safe and nutritious food.
- **Reducing Illness:** Decreasing cases of foodborne illness (600 million annually) and zoonotic diseases (1 billion annually) by one-third.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “malnutrition,” “food security,” or “public health.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, and food security.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If nutrition, health, or food security are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that nutrition, health, or food security objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a nutrition, health, and food security tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

"5569","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

"5840","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

 Introduction  
Background 
This report summarizes findings from the project “Agroecological transitions for building resilient and 
inclusive agricultural and food systems (TRANSITIONS)” which is funded by the European Commission 
through its Development of Smart Innovation through Research in Agriculture (DeSIRA) initiative and 
managed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Digital Tools regional work 
in Vietnam focused on research and engagement with digital tools for technical advice and performance 
assessment in sustainable rice production in the Mekong River Delta due to the high climate change 
impacts, climate change mitigation potentials and sustainability challenges.  
Methodology  
This report focused on the learnings from 2 field studies. The first conducted in September 2022 in Can 
Tho province in the Mekong Delta with 24 farmers and extension agents. The digital tool tested was a 
prototype created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for 
rice farmers. The second conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta on SRP farming 
practices and digital tool use. Data was collected in March 2023, through FGDs with 20 farmers and 5 
field agents. The digital tool tested was a prototype created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is 
designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of GHG emissions.   
The purpose of the FGDs was to: 
 Discuss the support that farmers receive in terms of sources of information/guidance and 
performance assessment in rice production. 
 Discuss how farmers use digital tools to improve, monitor, and evaluate their SRP farming practices.

Farmers’ agroecology practices and sources of technical advice/performance 
assessment 
Non-contracted farmers cultivate rice in three cropping seasons thus, they do not cultivate other crops 
besides rice. They want to decrease to two rice cropping seasons since there is limited profit. It will 
require local government support to convert from three cropping seasons to two cropping seasons. 
Some contracted farmers diversify to other crops besides rice in order to increase their income. They 
cultivate fruit trees like durian, jackfruit, and longan in Thoi Lai and Co Do districts.   
Farmers use a number of methods to improve input use efficiency. This includes the use of the Three 
Reductions, Three Gains (3R3G) approach and One Must Do, 5 Reductions (1M5R) which are both 
government programmes to decrease seed, fertilizer, and pesticide input use. Contracted farmers plant 
their rice based on the recommended schedule of the local government. They use sowing with drum 
seeders or mechanized transplanting, spraying is done by drone, and they use a combine harvester to 
harvest the crop. They also implement ecological engineering for pest management in rice crops such as 
planting nectar-rich flower plants on the bunds surrounding rice fields. They apply the alternate wetting 
and drying (AWD) technique for water management and monitor the water level using water tubes. The 
contracting companies require farmers to use high-quality certified seeds, reduce fertilizers and 
pesticides, refrain from pumping water into fields, and use pesticides 20 days before harvest. The 
application of new measures/technologies are done in agreement with the company and the company 
provides training for farmers. The contracted companies pay an additional 200 VND/kg for rice. 
Contracted farmers access information through training courses, demonstration models, field visits from 
extension staff, television, communications via Zalo, Facebook (i.e. to inform each other in case of pests 
or diseases), Agricultural forecast bulletin (CIAT), MobiAgri application, and previous experiences. 
Non-contracted farmers are beginning to use improved methodologies. They use a reduced seed rate 
with 10-15kg/1300m2 (around 80-120kg/ha). They also use certified seeds, reduce chemical fertilisers 
and increase use of organic fertilizers. They are also reducing the number of seasonal pesticide sprayings 
from 5-6 times to 2-3 times as well as not using pesticides during the first 40 days after sowing. They are 
influenced by market requirements, application of new technologies by neighbouring farmers, concerns 
Page 9:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 for environmental impacts, and their desire to reduce input costs. They receive most of the technical 
advice through demonstration models, training classes, television, and talking with other farmers. 
In general, farmers find local agricultural field agents and company field agents the most reliable sources 
of information, followed by experienced fellow farmers and rice buyers. The preferred methods of 
advisory include regular field visits and face-to-face meetings where field agents are able to observe the 
field and provide accurate responses. Farmers and field agents usually use instant messaging methods 
such as Zalo for exchanging of information. Official weekly reports are made in written form. 
Testing of Agritask mobile application 
The digital tool tested during the first field testing in Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta was a prototype 
created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for rice farmers. 
The system is designed for use by both men and women. It is expected to improve efficiency in the data 
collection process whilst simplifying the process for farmers and reducing errors. With time, it is hoped 
that the tool will be used for SRP certification. The current business model is designed on the 
mechanism of paying farmers to use, since rice farmers do not display a strong desire to use digital tools 
to facilitate the data collection process. Farmers expect that this process should be facilitated by field 
agents as such, it will be important for Agritask to think about whether there is scalability in this 
approach. A more scalable approach would be to target field agents as the end users and as such 
developing a tool suitable for their needs. 
The farmers and field agents considered the Agritask application to be useful for the recording of 
farming practices and a more convenient approach than using pen and paper recording. The information 
is structured well and arranged logically. It is considered to have generally user-friendly interfaces. The 
pest and disease recommendations are useful and there are calculations of cost and profit, enabling 
comparison between seasons. 
Suggestions for improvement 
It was considered very important that farmers are able to extract and share the data that they have 
entered. There were a number of recommendations to reduce the rate of errors. It was recommended 
to allow farmers to edit data retrospectively in case of errors while recording. Allowing duplication of 
records where practices do not change over time can reduce errors for example, area or type and 
Page 10:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 volume of pesticides. Duplication of some entry points can also save a significant amount of time. It was 
suggested that a reminder warning be included if a user forgets to input data (according to an 
established frequency such as daily or weekly or a few times per week) similarly pest/disease warning 
were considered to be useful. Award points could encourage farmers to use frequently. 
Some more specific recommendations are: 
 Use of digit separators (. ,) 
 Charts of farming results (cost, yield, revenue, profit, etc.) to compare with the same season across 
different years. 
 The app currently does not allow saving data for the current day. It only allows saving for dates up 
to the date before the current date. Sometimes farmers use lunar calendar for crop establishment, 
it would be good if the app can show both lunar and solar calendars. 
 Machinery cost should be broken down to specific items such as land preparation, tillage/ploughing, 
sowing, etc.  
 Allow users to add items not available in the pre-designed lists of fertilisers and pesticides (some 
common fertilisers such as urea, DAP, Kali NPK 16-16-8, NPK 20-20-15 are not in the list). Under pest 
management: mouse management is missing. 
 Labour cost can be VND/day and can sometimes be a lump sum cost (not determined by labour 
day), so the app should allow to record labour cost by area (i.e. ha or season). 
 The area unit varies between provinces. While farmers in one province are familiar with ha, those in 
other provinces are more familiar with “big cong” (equivalent to 1296m2). 
 Farmers are confused among units of fertilizer (the way of inputting is not friendly to them) and the 
units for pesticide were too limiting. Some people would prefer litres, while others prefer bottles or 
other units.  
 The app’s error alerts were confusing to farmers, sometimes the alerts were in English even though 
the device system language and the app language were both in Vietnamese.

SRP management 
Rikolto launched their SRP project in Dong Thap 2018 with implementation of the model commencing at 
the end of 2019. By 2020, the program had been scaled up to involve approximately 800 small holder 
farmers across eight cooperatives, covering a total of 2,000-3,000 hectares of land. 
Scoring occurs once per crop season, typically at the end of the season. Agents visit farmers weekly to 
monitor progress, assess the current situation, and take notes for a summary report. The process to 
input farming data for SRP monitoring and scoring takes approximately two hours per SRP farmer. At the 
time of survey, SRP scoring was done by technicians in the local areas who had been trained in SRP in 
cooperation with the cooperatives; most farmers who joined this program reached 80% and above. 
There was a plan that Rikolto would hire an independent body to perform the scoring in 2023 with the 
expectation of selling rice at a higher price. 
Agents maintain records of each SRP farmer's name, rice area, field address, and phone number on hard 
copy documents. The SRP project provides agents an Excel form for scoring. SRP farmers keep record of 
farming diaries using a notebook provided by the project. The rice management diary includes 
information on seed varieties, fertilizer usage, harvesting practices, labour costs, yields, prices, and 
productivity. At the end of the season, these diaries are collected by field agents to input into a digital 
format (normally Excel) for scoring.  
It was reported that production cost reduced up to 30% per season. Currently, there is no contract 
farming scheme for SRP rice under this project. Farmers sell rice either to companies under the 
cooperatives’ on-going contracts or to middlemen. SRP rice under this project is sold at prices that are 
100-200 VND/kg higher than market prices for regular rice; the difference comes from negotiation based 
on improved quality (i.e., use of certified seeds and reduced chemical use). Some farmers indicated that 
after completing the pilot project, they would continue to implement the SRP techniques due to the 
financial benefits from saving input costs and health benefits for farmers. Some farmers shared that 
they would continue the model if the rice is certified and sold at considerably higher prices.

 In general, all famers apply AWD. Even during the wet season (Autumn – Winter), sometimes water is 
pumped out of the field to prevent logging. Farms use certified pesticides and apply integrated pest 
management practices to control pesticide use. Straw is generally incorporated before wet seasons and 
collected and sold during dry seasons. Straw is sold for production of mushroom, ornamental plants and 
flowers or compost.

Challenges faced by field agents while using digital tools  
Data is collected by field agents in pen and paper form in the field. When the agents return to their 
office this data is transcribed on to Excel. The software does not have all the statistical functions 
needed, and agents must use additional software like SPSS for further analysis. Additionally, it takes 
time to enter information from the notebook to Excel while doing SRP scoring. 
Communication tools such as Zalo are commonly used by field agents to communicate with farmers. 
Google maps is sometimes used by field agents however, it doesn’t meet the resolution needs to meet 
the requirements of users/officers in monitoring rice growth stages and pest detection. 
Field agents expressed an interest in using an app and transferring the notebook/diary to manage online 
by an application to save time, ensure consistency, and provide convenience. There was the suggestion 
of integrating the scoring function into the app so that farmers can enter data themselves under the 
support of field agents.  
Testing of CropPal mobile application 
The second field testing conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta tested a prototype 
created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of 
Page 13:

 GHG emissions. They are still in the process of developing a sustainable business model. They are 
proposing the app be pay for use by farmers or supported by financial institutions. It will be important to 
develop a long term scalable business model. One approach could be to design the app for use by public 
sector and private sector field agents, who work directly with farmers for SRP certification.  
Field agents considered CropPal to be generally convenient, accessible, and suitable for users/farmers. 
They liked the ability of CropPal to retain information.  It was suggested that a reminder warning be 
included for incomplete information in each section and there be a function to review the history of 
entered information. It was requested that there be a function to export outputs to Excel. It was 
proposed the design of a season management section by year. 
Interface 
Farmers struggled to interpret the icons. It was suggested that changing the icons to text or 
photographic images that are familiar to farmers which would make the buttons more easily 
recognisable. Farmers also preferred to have each button in its own distinctive colour. Vietnamese 
needs to be used as the primary language throughout the app. 
Field agents had a preference for use of kg unit instead of “bag” unit. Field agents suggested changing 
from drop down options to a blank space which allows flexibility of answer. List all fertilizer categories 
and leave the corresponding quantity blank for users. They suggested changing the way to log in to 
CropPal, using the user's phone number to get the number code automatically, which is only required 
the first time using the app. The app could then be managed by the field agents using farmer code. 
Functions 
It was recommended that the application include more statistical functions on varieties e.g. variety type, 
quantity/area of sowing). They would like additional functions for productivity and information about 
expenses for fertilizers, and labour costs. The definition of the duration of each rice variety should be 
adjusted as follows: Short-term rice (85-90 days), medium-term rice (95 days), long-term rice (>110 
days). Pest detection time needs to be included (dd/mm)

 Introduction  
Background 
This report summarizes findings from the project “Agroecological transitions for building resilient and 
inclusive agricultural and food systems (TRANSITIONS)” which is funded by the European Commission 
through its Development of Smart Innovation through Research in Agriculture (DeSIRA) initiative and 
managed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Digital Tools regional work 
in Vietnam focused on research and engagement with digital tools for technical advice and performance 
assessment in sustainable rice production in the Mekong River Delta due to the high climate change 
impacts, climate change mitigation potentials and sustainability challenges.  
Methodology  
This report focused on the learnings from 2 field studies. The first conducted in September 2022 in Can 
Tho province in the Mekong Delta with 24 farmers and extension agents. The digital tool tested was a 
prototype created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for 
rice farmers. The second conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta on SRP farming 
practices and digital tool use. Data was collected in March 2023, through FGDs with 20 farmers and 5 
field agents. The digital tool tested was a prototype created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is 
designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of GHG emissions.   
The purpose of the FGDs was to: 
 Discuss the support that farmers receive in terms of sources of information/guidance and 
performance assessment in rice production. 
 Discuss how farmers use digital tools to improve, monitor, and evaluate their SRP farming practices.

Farmers’ agroecology practices and sources of technical advice/performance 
assessment 
Non-contracted farmers cultivate rice in three cropping seasons thus, they do not cultivate other crops 
besides rice. They want to decrease to two rice cropping seasons since there is limited profit. It will 
require local government support to convert from three cropping seasons to two cropping seasons. 
Some contracted farmers diversify to other crops besides rice in order to increase their income. They 
cultivate fruit trees like durian, jackfruit, and longan in Thoi Lai and Co Do districts.   
Farmers use a number of methods to improve input use efficiency. This includes the use of the Three 
Reductions, Three Gains (3R3G) approach and One Must Do, 5 Reductions (1M5R) which are both 
government programmes to decrease seed, fertilizer, and pesticide input use. Contracted farmers plant 
their rice based on the recommended schedule of the local government. They use sowing with drum 
seeders or mechanized transplanting, spraying is done by drone, and they use a combine harvester to 
harvest the crop. They also implement ecological engineering for pest management in rice crops such as 
planting nectar-rich flower plants on the bunds surrounding rice fields. They apply the alternate wetting 
and drying (AWD) technique for water management and monitor the water level using water tubes. The 
contracting companies require farmers to use high-quality certified seeds, reduce fertilizers and 
pesticides, refrain from pumping water into fields, and use pesticides 20 days before harvest. The 
application of new measures/technologies are done in agreement with the company and the company 
provides training for farmers. The contracted companies pay an additional 200 VND/kg for rice. 
Contracted farmers access information through training courses, demonstration models, field visits from 
extension staff, television, communications via Zalo, Facebook (i.e. to inform each other in case of pests 
or diseases), Agricultural forecast bulletin (CIAT), MobiAgri application, and previous experiences. 
Non-contracted farmers are beginning to use improved methodologies. They use a reduced seed rate 
with 10-15kg/1300m2 (around 80-120kg/ha). They also use certified seeds, reduce chemical fertilisers 
and increase use of organic fertilizers. They are also reducing the number of seasonal pesticide sprayings 
from 5-6 times to 2-3 times as well as not using pesticides during the first 40 days after sowing. They are 
influenced by market requirements, application of new technologies by neighbouring farmers, concerns 
Page 9:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 for environmental impacts, and their desire to reduce input costs. They receive most of the technical 
advice through demonstration models, training classes, television, and talking with other farmers. 
In general, farmers find local agricultural field agents and company field agents the most reliable sources 
of information, followed by experienced fellow farmers and rice buyers. The preferred methods of 
advisory include regular field visits and face-to-face meetings where field agents are able to observe the 
field and provide accurate responses. Farmers and field agents usually use instant messaging methods 
such as Zalo for exchanging of information. Official weekly reports are made in written form. 
Testing of Agritask mobile application 
The digital tool tested during the first field testing in Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta was a prototype 
created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for rice farmers. 
The system is designed for use by both men and women. It is expected to improve efficiency in the data 
collection process whilst simplifying the process for farmers and reducing errors. With time, it is hoped 
that the tool will be used for SRP certification. The current business model is designed on the 
mechanism of paying farmers to use, since rice farmers do not display a strong desire to use digital tools 
to facilitate the data collection process. Farmers expect that this process should be facilitated by field 
agents as such, it will be important for Agritask to think about whether there is scalability in this 
approach. A more scalable approach would be to target field agents as the end users and as such 
developing a tool suitable for their needs. 
The farmers and field agents considered the Agritask application to be useful for the recording of 
farming practices and a more convenient approach than using pen and paper recording. The information 
is structured well and arranged logically. It is considered to have generally user-friendly interfaces. The 
pest and disease recommendations are useful and there are calculations of cost and profit, enabling 
comparison between seasons. 
Suggestions for improvement 
It was considered very important that farmers are able to extract and share the data that they have 
entered. There were a number of recommendations to reduce the rate of errors. It was recommended 
to allow farmers to edit data retrospectively in case of errors while recording. Allowing duplication of 
records where practices do not change over time can reduce errors for example, area or type and 
Page 10:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 volume of pesticides. Duplication of some entry points can also save a significant amount of time. It was 
suggested that a reminder warning be included if a user forgets to input data (according to an 
established frequency such as daily or weekly or a few times per week) similarly pest/disease warning 
were considered to be useful. Award points could encourage farmers to use frequently. 
Some more specific recommendations are: 
 Use of digit separators (. ,) 
 Charts of farming results (cost, yield, revenue, profit, etc.) to compare with the same season across 
different years. 
 The app currently does not allow saving data for the current day. It only allows saving for dates up 
to the date before the current date. Sometimes farmers use lunar calendar for crop establishment, 
it would be good if the app can show both lunar and solar calendars. 
 Machinery cost should be broken down to specific items such as land preparation, tillage/ploughing, 
sowing, etc.  
 Allow users to add items not available in the pre-designed lists of fertilisers and pesticides (some 
common fertilisers such as urea, DAP, Kali NPK 16-16-8, NPK 20-20-15 are not in the list). Under pest 
management: mouse management is missing. 
 Labour cost can be VND/day and can sometimes be a lump sum cost (not determined by labour 
day), so the app should allow to record labour cost by area (i.e. ha or season). 
 The area unit varies between provinces. While farmers in one province are familiar with ha, those in 
other provinces are more familiar with “big cong” (equivalent to 1296m2). 
 Farmers are confused among units of fertilizer (the way of inputting is not friendly to them) and the 
units for pesticide were too limiting. Some people would prefer litres, while others prefer bottles or 
other units.  
 The app’s error alerts were confusing to farmers, sometimes the alerts were in English even though 
the device system language and the app language were both in Vietnamese.

SRP management 
Rikolto launched their SRP project in Dong Thap 2018 with implementation of the model commencing at 
the end of 2019. By 2020, the program had been scaled up to involve approximately 800 small holder 
farmers across eight cooperatives, covering a total of 2,000-3,000 hectares of land. 
Scoring occurs once per crop season, typically at the end of the season. Agents visit farmers weekly to 
monitor progress, assess the current situation, and take notes for a summary report. The process to 
input farming data for SRP monitoring and scoring takes approximately two hours per SRP farmer. At the 
time of survey, SRP scoring was done by technicians in the local areas who had been trained in SRP in 
cooperation with the cooperatives; most farmers who joined this program reached 80% and above. 
There was a plan that Rikolto would hire an independent body to perform the scoring in 2023 with the 
expectation of selling rice at a higher price. 
Agents maintain records of each SRP farmer's name, rice area, field address, and phone number on hard 
copy documents. The SRP project provides agents an Excel form for scoring. SRP farmers keep record of 
farming diaries using a notebook provided by the project. The rice management diary includes 
information on seed varieties, fertilizer usage, harvesting practices, labour costs, yields, prices, and 
productivity. At the end of the season, these diaries are collected by field agents to input into a digital 
format (normally Excel) for scoring.  
It was reported that production cost reduced up to 30% per season. Currently, there is no contract 
farming scheme for SRP rice under this project. Farmers sell rice either to companies under the 
cooperatives’ on-going contracts or to middlemen. SRP rice under this project is sold at prices that are 
100-200 VND/kg higher than market prices for regular rice; the difference comes from negotiation based 
on improved quality (i.e., use of certified seeds and reduced chemical use). Some farmers indicated that 
after completing the pilot project, they would continue to implement the SRP techniques due to the 
financial benefits from saving input costs and health benefits for farmers. Some farmers shared that 
they would continue the model if the rice is certified and sold at considerably higher prices.

 In general, all famers apply AWD. Even during the wet season (Autumn – Winter), sometimes water is 
pumped out of the field to prevent logging. Farms use certified pesticides and apply integrated pest 
management practices to control pesticide use. Straw is generally incorporated before wet seasons and 
collected and sold during dry seasons. Straw is sold for production of mushroom, ornamental plants and 
flowers or compost.

Challenges faced by field agents while using digital tools  
Data is collected by field agents in pen and paper form in the field. When the agents return to their 
office this data is transcribed on to Excel. The software does not have all the statistical functions 
needed, and agents must use additional software like SPSS for further analysis. Additionally, it takes 
time to enter information from the notebook to Excel while doing SRP scoring. 
Communication tools such as Zalo are commonly used by field agents to communicate with farmers. 
Google maps is sometimes used by field agents however, it doesn’t meet the resolution needs to meet 
the requirements of users/officers in monitoring rice growth stages and pest detection. 
Field agents expressed an interest in using an app and transferring the notebook/diary to manage online 
by an application to save time, ensure consistency, and provide convenience. There was the suggestion 
of integrating the scoring function into the app so that farmers can enter data themselves under the 
support of field agents.  
Testing of CropPal mobile application 
The second field testing conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta tested a prototype 
created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of 
Page 13:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 GHG emissions. They are still in the process of developing a sustainable business model. They are 
proposing the app be pay for use by farmers or supported by financial institutions. It will be important to 
develop a long term scalable business model. One approach could be to design the app for use by public 
sector and private sector field agents, who work directly with farmers for SRP certification.  
Field agents considered CropPal to be generally convenient, accessible, and suitable for users/farmers. 
They liked the ability of CropPal to retain information.  It was suggested that a reminder warning be 
included for incomplete information in each section and there be a function to review the history of 
entered information. It was requested that there be a function to export outputs to Excel. It was 
proposed the design of a season management section by year. 
Interface 
Farmers struggled to interpret the icons. It was suggested that changing the icons to text or 
photographic images that are familiar to farmers which would make the buttons more easily 
recognisable. Farmers also preferred to have each button in its own distinctive colour. Vietnamese 
needs to be used as the primary language throughout the app. 
Field agents had a preference for use of kg unit instead of “bag” unit. Field agents suggested changing 
from drop down options to a blank space which allows flexibility of answer. List all fertilizer categories 
and leave the corresponding quantity blank for users. They suggested changing the way to log in to 
CropPal, using the user's phone number to get the number code automatically, which is only required 
the first time using the app. The app could then be managed by the field agents using farmer code. 
Functions 
It was recommended that the application include more statistical functions on varieties e.g. variety type, 
quantity/area of sowing). They would like additional functions for productivity and information about 
expenses for fertilizers, and labour costs. The definition of the duration of each rice variety should be 
adjusted as follows: Short-term rice (85-90 days), medium-term rice (95 days), long-term rice (>110 
days). Pest detection time needs to be included (dd/mm)

 Introduction  
Background 
This report summarizes findings from the project “Agroecological transitions for building resilient and 
inclusive agricultural and food systems (TRANSITIONS)” which is funded by the European Commission 
through its Development of Smart Innovation through Research in Agriculture (DeSIRA) initiative and 
managed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Digital Tools regional work 
in Vietnam focused on research and engagement with digital tools for technical advice and performance 
assessment in sustainable rice production in the Mekong River Delta due to the high climate change 
impacts, climate change mitigation potentials and sustainability challenges.  
Methodology  
This report focused on the learnings from 2 field studies. The first conducted in September 2022 in Can 
Tho province in the Mekong Delta with 24 farmers and extension agents. The digital tool tested was a 
prototype created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for 
rice farmers. The second conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta on SRP farming 
practices and digital tool use. Data was collected in March 2023, through FGDs with 20 farmers and 5 
field agents. The digital tool tested was a prototype created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is 
designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of GHG emissions.   
The purpose of the FGDs was to: 
 Discuss the support that farmers receive in terms of sources of information/guidance and 
performance assessment in rice production. 
 Discuss how farmers use digital tools to improve, monitor, and evaluate their SRP farming practices.

Farmers’ agroecology practices and sources of technical advice/performance 
assessment 
Non-contracted farmers cultivate rice in three cropping seasons thus, they do not cultivate other crops 
besides rice. They want to decrease to two rice cropping seasons since there is limited profit. It will 
require local government support to convert from three cropping seasons to two cropping seasons. 
Some contracted farmers diversify to other crops besides rice in order to increase their income. They 
cultivate fruit trees like durian, jackfruit, and longan in Thoi Lai and Co Do districts.   
Farmers use a number of methods to improve input use efficiency. This includes the use of the Three 
Reductions, Three Gains (3R3G) approach and One Must Do, 5 Reductions (1M5R) which are both 
government programmes to decrease seed, fertilizer, and pesticide input use. Contracted farmers plant 
their rice based on the recommended schedule of the local government. They use sowing with drum 
seeders or mechanized transplanting, spraying is done by drone, and they use a combine harvester to 
harvest the crop. They also implement ecological engineering for pest management in rice crops such as 
planting nectar-rich flower plants on the bunds surrounding rice fields. They apply the alternate wetting 
and drying (AWD) technique for water management and monitor the water level using water tubes. The 
contracting companies require farmers to use high-quality certified seeds, reduce fertilizers and 
pesticides, refrain from pumping water into fields, and use pesticides 20 days before harvest. The 
application of new measures/technologies are done in agreement with the company and the company 
provides training for farmers. The contracted companies pay an additional 200 VND/kg for rice. 
Contracted farmers access information through training courses, demonstration models, field visits from 
extension staff, television, communications via Zalo, Facebook (i.e. to inform each other in case of pests 
or diseases), Agricultural forecast bulletin (CIAT), MobiAgri application, and previous experiences. 
Non-contracted farmers are beginning to use improved methodologies. They use a reduced seed rate 
with 10-15kg/1300m2 (around 80-120kg/ha). They also use certified seeds, reduce chemical fertilisers 
and increase use of organic fertilizers. They are also reducing the number of seasonal pesticide sprayings 
from 5-6 times to 2-3 times as well as not using pesticides during the first 40 days after sowing. They are 
influenced by market requirements, application of new technologies by neighbouring farmers, concerns 
Page 9:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 for environmental impacts, and their desire to reduce input costs. They receive most of the technical 
advice through demonstration models, training classes, television, and talking with other farmers. 
In general, farmers find local agricultural field agents and company field agents the most reliable sources 
of information, followed by experienced fellow farmers and rice buyers. The preferred methods of 
advisory include regular field visits and face-to-face meetings where field agents are able to observe the 
field and provide accurate responses. Farmers and field agents usually use instant messaging methods 
such as Zalo for exchanging of information. Official weekly reports are made in written form. 
Testing of Agritask mobile application 
The digital tool tested during the first field testing in Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta was a prototype 
created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for rice farmers. 
The system is designed for use by both men and women. It is expected to improve efficiency in the data 
collection process whilst simplifying the process for farmers and reducing errors. With time, it is hoped 
that the tool will be used for SRP certification. The current business model is designed on the 
mechanism of paying farmers to use, since rice farmers do not display a strong desire to use digital tools 
to facilitate the data collection process. Farmers expect that this process should be facilitated by field 
agents as such, it will be important for Agritask to think about whether there is scalability in this 
approach. A more scalable approach would be to target field agents as the end users and as such 
developing a tool suitable for their needs. 
The farmers and field agents considered the Agritask application to be useful for the recording of 
farming practices and a more convenient approach than using pen and paper recording. The information 
is structured well and arranged logically. It is considered to have generally user-friendly interfaces. The 
pest and disease recommendations are useful and there are calculations of cost and profit, enabling 
comparison between seasons. 
Suggestions for improvement 
It was considered very important that farmers are able to extract and share the data that they have 
entered. There were a number of recommendations to reduce the rate of errors. It was recommended 
to allow farmers to edit data retrospectively in case of errors while recording. Allowing duplication of 
records where practices do not change over time can reduce errors for example, area or type and 
Page 10:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 volume of pesticides. Duplication of some entry points can also save a significant amount of time. It was 
suggested that a reminder warning be included if a user forgets to input data (according to an 
established frequency such as daily or weekly or a few times per week) similarly pest/disease warning 
were considered to be useful. Award points could encourage farmers to use frequently. 
Some more specific recommendations are: 
 Use of digit separators (. ,) 
 Charts of farming results (cost, yield, revenue, profit, etc.) to compare with the same season across 
different years. 
 The app currently does not allow saving data for the current day. It only allows saving for dates up 
to the date before the current date. Sometimes farmers use lunar calendar for crop establishment, 
it would be good if the app can show both lunar and solar calendars. 
 Machinery cost should be broken down to specific items such as land preparation, tillage/ploughing, 
sowing, etc.  
 Allow users to add items not available in the pre-designed lists of fertilisers and pesticides (some 
common fertilisers such as urea, DAP, Kali NPK 16-16-8, NPK 20-20-15 are not in the list). Under pest 
management: mouse management is missing. 
 Labour cost can be VND/day and can sometimes be a lump sum cost (not determined by labour 
day), so the app should allow to record labour cost by area (i.e. ha or season). 
 The area unit varies between provinces. While farmers in one province are familiar with ha, those in 
other provinces are more familiar with “big cong” (equivalent to 1296m2). 
 Farmers are confused among units of fertilizer (the way of inputting is not friendly to them) and the 
units for pesticide were too limiting. Some people would prefer litres, while others prefer bottles or 
other units.  
 The app’s error alerts were confusing to farmers, sometimes the alerts were in English even though 
the device system language and the app language were both in Vietnamese.

SRP management 
Rikolto launched their SRP project in Dong Thap 2018 with implementation of the model commencing at 
the end of 2019. By 2020, the program had been scaled up to involve approximately 800 small holder 
farmers across eight cooperatives, covering a total of 2,000-3,000 hectares of land. 
Scoring occurs once per crop season, typically at the end of the season. Agents visit farmers weekly to 
monitor progress, assess the current situation, and take notes for a summary report. The process to 
input farming data for SRP monitoring and scoring takes approximately two hours per SRP farmer. At the 
time of survey, SRP scoring was done by technicians in the local areas who had been trained in SRP in 
cooperation with the cooperatives; most farmers who joined this program reached 80% and above. 
There was a plan that Rikolto would hire an independent body to perform the scoring in 2023 with the 
expectation of selling rice at a higher price. 
Agents maintain records of each SRP farmer's name, rice area, field address, and phone number on hard 
copy documents. The SRP project provides agents an Excel form for scoring. SRP farmers keep record of 
farming diaries using a notebook provided by the project. The rice management diary includes 
information on seed varieties, fertilizer usage, harvesting practices, labour costs, yields, prices, and 
productivity. At the end of the season, these diaries are collected by field agents to input into a digital 
format (normally Excel) for scoring.  
It was reported that production cost reduced up to 30% per season. Currently, there is no contract 
farming scheme for SRP rice under this project. Farmers sell rice either to companies under the 
cooperatives’ on-going contracts or to middlemen. SRP rice under this project is sold at prices that are 
100-200 VND/kg higher than market prices for regular rice; the difference comes from negotiation based 
on improved quality (i.e., use of certified seeds and reduced chemical use). Some farmers indicated that 
after completing the pilot project, they would continue to implement the SRP techniques due to the 
financial benefits from saving input costs and health benefits for farmers. Some farmers shared that 
they would continue the model if the rice is certified and sold at considerably higher prices.

 In general, all famers apply AWD. Even during the wet season (Autumn – Winter), sometimes water is 
pumped out of the field to prevent logging. Farms use certified pesticides and apply integrated pest 
management practices to control pesticide use. Straw is generally incorporated before wet seasons and 
collected and sold during dry seasons. Straw is sold for production of mushroom, ornamental plants and 
flowers or compost.

Challenges faced by field agents while using digital tools  
Data is collected by field agents in pen and paper form in the field. When the agents return to their 
office this data is transcribed on to Excel. The software does not have all the statistical functions 
needed, and agents must use additional software like SPSS for further analysis. Additionally, it takes 
time to enter information from the notebook to Excel while doing SRP scoring. 
Communication tools such as Zalo are commonly used by field agents to communicate with farmers. 
Google maps is sometimes used by field agents however, it doesn’t meet the resolution needs to meet 
the requirements of users/officers in monitoring rice growth stages and pest detection. 
Field agents expressed an interest in using an app and transferring the notebook/diary to manage online 
by an application to save time, ensure consistency, and provide convenience. There was the suggestion 
of integrating the scoring function into the app so that farmers can enter data themselves under the 
support of field agents.  
Testing of CropPal mobile application 
The second field testing conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta tested a prototype 
created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of 
Page 13:

 GHG emissions. They are still in the process of developing a sustainable business model. They are 
proposing the app be pay for use by farmers or supported by financial institutions. It will be important to 
develop a long term scalable business model. One approach could be to design the app for use by public 
sector and private sector field agents, who work directly with farmers for SRP certification.  
Field agents considered CropPal to be generally convenient, accessible, and suitable for users/farmers. 
They liked the ability of CropPal to retain information.  It was suggested that a reminder warning be 
included for incomplete information in each section and there be a function to review the history of 
entered information. It was requested that there be a function to export outputs to Excel. It was 
proposed the design of a season management section by year. 
Interface 
Farmers struggled to interpret the icons. It was suggested that changing the icons to text or 
photographic images that are familiar to farmers which would make the buttons more easily 
recognisable. Farmers also preferred to have each button in its own distinctive colour. Vietnamese 
needs to be used as the primary language throughout the app. 
Field agents had a preference for use of kg unit instead of “bag” unit. Field agents suggested changing 
from drop down options to a blank space which allows flexibility of answer. List all fertilizer categories 
and leave the corresponding quantity blank for users. They suggested changing the way to log in to 
CropPal, using the user's phone number to get the number code automatically, which is only required 
the first time using the app. The app could then be managed by the field agents using farmer code. 
Functions 
It was recommended that the application include more statistical functions on varieties e.g. variety type, 
quantity/area of sowing). They would like additional functions for productivity and information about 
expenses for fertilizers, and labour costs. The definition of the duration of each rice variety should be 
adjusted as follows: Short-term rice (85-90 days), medium-term rice (95 days), long-term rice (>110 
days). Pest detection time needs to be included (dd/mm)

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:

Conservation agriculture for regenerating soil health and climate change mitigation in smallholder systems of South Asia The increase in agriculture production to meet the food demand of growing human population from a limited availability of arable land with low environmental footprints and preserving natural resources (soil, water and air) simultaneously are major challenges in South Asia. The situation is further complicated by the climate change, which will further lower the food production, compounding the challenge of meeting food demand. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is solution to several challenges being faced in farming such as soil health, climate change, water scarcity, agricultural pollution, farm profitability, human health, etc. This exhaustive review examines the published literature from South Asia to assess the impact of CA on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the subsequent impacts on soil health (physical, chemical and biological properties), C sequestration and greenhouse gases emissions in major cropping systems. The results from several studies demonstrated that CA increased SOC and improved soil health parameters, mainly in the surface soil layer. The effects of CA on the changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity are small. The CA showed a remarkable positive impact on the nutrient availability in the soil. The CA system helped in both climate change mitigation and adaptation for sustainable crop production. The present gaps in our knowledge in soil health assessment and research agenda to fill the gaps are also included in this chapter. We hope this review of past accomplishments, current activities, and future opportunities will stimulate additional soil health research throughout the 21st century. Chapter Three.

The objectives of this study were to develop a precision SPVD phenotyping protocol, to find new SPVD-resistant genotypes, and to standardize the first stages of screening for SPVD resistance. The first part of the protocol was based on ELISA results for sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and sweet potato virus C (SPVC) with adjustments to a negative control (uninfected clone 'Tanzania') and was performed on a pre-breeding population (VZ08) comprising 455 clones and 27 check clones graft-inoculated under screenhouse conditions. The second part included field studies with 52 selected clones for SPCSV resistance from VZ08 and eight checks. In screenhouse conditions, the resistant and susceptible check clones performed as expected, 63 clones from VZ08 exhibited lower relative absorbance values for SPCSV and SPVC than inoculated check Tanzania. Field experiments confirmed SPVD resistance of several clones selected by relative absorbance values (nine resistant clones in two locations, i.e. 17.3% of the screenhouse selection), supporting the reliability of our method for SPVD-resistance selection. Two clones were promising, exhibiting high storage root yields of 28.7-34.9 t ha-1 and SPVD resistance, based on the proposed selection procedure. This modified serological analysis for SPVD-resistance phenotyping might lead to more efficient development of resistant varieties by reducing costs and time at early stages, and provide solid data for marker assisted selection with a quantitative tool for classifying resistance.

In screenhouse conditions, the resistant and susceptible check clones performed as expected, 63 clones from VZ08 exhibited lower relative absorbance values for SPCSV and SPVC than inoculated check Tanzania. Field experiments confirmed SPVD resistance of several clones selected by relative absorbance values (nine resistant clones in two locations, i.e. 17.3% of the screenhouse selection), supporting the reliability of our method for SPVD-resistance selection. Two clones were promising, exhibiting high storage root yields of 28.7-34.9 t ha-1 and SPVD resistance, based on the proposed selection procedure. This modified serological analysis for SPVD-resistance phenotyping might lead to more efficient development of resistant varieties by reducing costs and time at early stages, and provide solid data for marker assisted selection with a quantitative tool for classifying resistance.

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:

Concerted governance efforts can help move the sector beyond fragmented technical questions associated with intensification and expansion, social and environmental impacts, and toward system-based approaches that address interconnected sustainability issues. Through a review and expert-elicitation process, we identify five engagement arenas to advance a governance agenda for aquaculture sustainability transformation: (1) setting sustainability transformation goals, (2) cross-sectoral linkages, (3) land–water–sea connectivity, (4) knowledge and innovation, and (5) value chains. We then outline the roles different actors and modes of governance can play in fostering sustainability transformations, and discuss action items for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to operationalize activities within their engagement arenas.

Influence of altitude as a proxy for temperature on key Musa pests and diseases in watershed areas of Burundi and Rwanda. Heliyon 9(3): e13854. ISSN: 2405-8440 Permanent link to cite or share this item https://hdl.handle.net/10568/129114 External link to download this item DOI https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e13854 Abstract/Description Pests and diseases are key biotic constraints limiting banana production among smallholder farmers in Eastern and Central Africa. Climate changemay favour pest and disease development and further exacerbate the vulnerability of smallholder farming systems to biotic constraints. Information on effects of climate change on pests and pathogens of banana is required by policy makers and researchers in designing control strategies and adaptation plans. Since altitude is inversely related to temperature, this study used the occurrence of key banana pests and diseases along an altitude gradient as a proxy for the potential impact of changes in temperature associated with global warming on pests and diseases. We assessed the occurrence of banana pests and diseases in 93 banana fields across three altitude ranges in Burundi and 99 fields distributed in two altitude ranges in Rwanda watersheds. Incidence and prevalence of Banana Bunchy Top Disease (BBTD) and Fusarium wilt (FW) was significantly associated with temperature and altitude in Burundi, revealing that increasing temperatures may lead to upward movement of banana diseases. No significant associations with temperature and altitude were observed for weevils, nematodes and Xanthomonas wilt of banana (BXW). Data collected in this study provides a baseline to verify and guide modelling work to predict future pest and disease distribution according to climate change scenarios. Such information is useful in informing policy makers and designing appropriate management strategies.

 Introduction  
 
iShamba, part of MediaE company, is a call centre  staffed by agricultural professionals where 
farmers can SMS in their inquiries or phone in for immediate assistance. Along with the weather 
updates and market prices, iShamba offers Agri -tips on crops and livestock after a farmer signs up. 
Farmers can eit her sign up for free or choose a premium plan for a small fee per year.  
Overview  
 
The Climate Action team's Livestock and Climate Initiative project, led by Scientist Dharani Dhar 
Burra, is interested in understanding historical messaging patterns and their correlation with 
climate hazards data from livestock farmers' current interactio ns with agriculture service provider 
platforms like iShamba. This information will further help to develop a high resolution targeted/ 
timely advisory package for livestock farmers through the service provider platforms.  
Objectives  
 
This project will aim to:  
 
1. Understand current trends/patterns of historical interactions of farmers with the iShamba 
platform.  
2. Identify if there is a pattern between messaging from farmers and climate hazards.  
3. We can then estimate farmers information requirements much ahead of time based on the 
forecasted climate hazards.  
4. This pre -emption of information requirement will then help us build more targeted advisory 
packages for the livestock farmers.  
5. Assess the applicability of the targeted advisories sent to the farmers through surveys.  
Data  
 
This project aims to analyze unstructured data from the iShamba platform, specifically text 
messages sent by farmers between the years 2015 to 2022. The initial plan was to utilize two 
years of data, but after preliminary data processing, many cases were d ropped due to incomplete 
or one -word messages received from the farmers, leading to a significant drop in the number of 
observations.         
 
The dataset received from the iShamba platform for the specified years contains 319,569 records. 
However, after data pre -processing and filtering to include only livestock -specific messages, and 
manually deleting duplicate SMS messages, the final sample si ze for this study is 72,062, with no 
missing data in the dataset.   
 
The variables included in the dataset are Task ID, Customer ID, Date, Time, Description, 
SMS sent by farmers, Responses to SMS, Assignees, Priority, SMS Tags, County, Sub - 
County, Wards, and x and y location points. The analysis will focus on the following  
variables:  
 
Page 4:
 
Page. 4  
 • Date - a character variable recorded by the platform for every farmer's inquiry received. The 
year and month will be extracted to calculate climate hazards later in the analysis.  
• SMS sent by farmers - a character variable containing the text messages received by 
farmers on the iShamba platform.  
• Sub-county - a character variable that records the county location of the farmer.  
• Ward - a character variable that records the sub -county location of the farmer.  
 
The number of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) are both recognized to reduce 
the productivity of livestock. However, the Agriculture Adaptation Atlas does not provide the mean 
number of NDD and THI for the years 2015 -2022. Therefore, bo th climate hazards were computed 
monthly for each year and ward using a projected climate hazards model. This will help to develop 
a relationship between the text messages received by farmers and both climate hazards. The 
overall goal of this relationship is to project future advisories that iShamba can send to livestock 
farmers regarding climate hazards at appropriate time in their location.  
 
Methodology  
 
I.Data Pre -Processing  
 
The data pre -processing for this project was conducted using R, due to the unstructured 
nature of the data. The initial step involved the removal of special characters, numbers, 
brackets, and quotes. This was followed by the separation of the time and date into new 
variables to extract the year and month for calculating the mean climate hazards in later 
analysis.  
 
The third step of the pre -processing included trimming the white spaces between text, 
selecting SMS messages that had a character count of 3 or above, and converting all text to 
lowercase. Additionally, some misspelled words in the SMS sent by farmers colu mn were 
corrected to enhance the accuracy of the subsequent analysis.  
 
A total of 140 wards were missing in the dataset, but their location points X and Y were 
available. To obtain the names of these wards, a join was performed with a Kenya shapefile 
dataset using the X and Y location points. This allowed for the extraction of the missing ward 
names, completing the dataset. Finally, records of counties that were not in Kenya and rows 
with ""NA"" across the county, sub -county, ward, and X and Y location points were dropped. The 
resulting p re-processed dataset had 252,759 observations.  
 
II.Filtering data to livestock  
 
To filter the dataset to focus only on livestock -related queries, a text analysis was performed 
using the ""Tm"" package in R to tokenize the SMS messages into words. A total of 264 words 
were removed, including non -English words and common words that were n ot relevant to the 
analysis. This resulted in a list of 81,114 unique words. The tokenized words list was then 
shared with iShamba to identify livestock -related words, which were flagged as ""high,"" while 
words that were not related to livestock were flagged as ""low."" This process yielded a list of 
Page 5:
 
Page. 5  
 5,956 unique words related to livestock. These words were used to filter the text messages to 
only include those that contained one or more words related to livestock.  
 
This filtering process resulted in a dataset of 78,169 observations. However, to eliminate 
duplicate SMS messages, a manual deletion process was conducted, resulting in a reduced 
dataset of 72,062 observations. A join operation was performed by creating a file containing 
unique IDs of sub -counties and wards, which was then merged with the filtered text data.  
 
To compute the monthly NDD and THI values for each ward, the same computation steps 
used for the development of the global adaptation atlas ( AdaptationAtlas - hazards ) were 
applied. The resulting data was aggregated to obtain average values for each month/year and 
ward. These average values were appended to the iShamba dataset, which contained the 
corresponding month, year, and ward for each SMS message.  
 
To facilitate analysis and interpretation, the NDD and THI values were transformed into new 
binary categorical variables as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl: a character variable defined as1: 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress"" = “yes”,  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”.  
 
• ndd_lvl: a character variable defined as:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress"" = “yes”.  
 
Consequently, the final dataset consists of 72,062 observations and includes six variables: 
SMS (actual) by farmers, month, year, ward, thi_lvl, and ndd_lvl. This filtered dataset was 
used for the subsequent analysis.  
 
III.Analysis  
 
Structural Topic Model (STM) provides a variety of statistical approaches for analyzing text 
data. The STM allows one to discover topics and estimate their relationship to document 
metadata. The  “stm” package in R provides tools to facilitate the workflow associated with 
analyzing textual data and users have a broad array of options to process raw text data, 
explore and analyze the data, and present findings using a variety of plotting tools.  
 
The steps involved in the STM topic prevalence model are as follows:  
 
1. Loading the data in R:  The ""stm"" package represents the text corpus in three parts:  
 
• A documents list containing word indices and their associated counts.  
 
1 The iShamba data has no THI “sever stress” cases.  
Page 6:
 
Page. 6  
 • A vocab character vector containing the words associated with the word indices.  
• A metadata matrix containing document covariates.  
 
2. Applying the ""textProcessor"" function:  This function is used to preprocess the data 
by removing punctuation, eliminating stop words, and stemming the words. It leverages 
the ""tm"" package and can be applied across multiple languages.  
 
3. Using the utility function ""prepDocuments"":  This function processes the loaded 
data to ensure it is in the correct format. It can also remove infrequent terms based on 
a user -set parameter called ""lower.thresh."" Additionally, ""prepDocuments""  will re -
index all metadata and document relationships if any changes occur during the 
processing. If a document is completely removed due to preprocessing (e.g., if it 
contained only rare words), the corresponding row in the metadata will be dropped. It i s 
important to inspect the document features and vocabulary list after reading and 
processing the text data to verify that the preprocessing steps have been applied 
correctly . 
 
These steps are crucial for preparing the data for the subsequent stages of the STM topic 
prevalence model. After the data import process in steps 2 and 3, the text corpus includes of 
71,105 documents and 16,467 tokens.  
 
4. Exploration of Topic Model s: Determining the optimal number of topics for a given 
corpus is not a straightforward task (Grimmer and Stewart 2013). To address this 
challenge, the ""searchK""  function employs a data -driven approach to select the 
appropriate number of topics. This function conducts various automated tests, such as 
calculating the held -out likelihood (Wallach et al. 2009) and performing residual 
analysis (Taddy 2012). By default , the ""Spectral""  initialization method is used due to 
its stability. Additionally, the ""searchK""  function computes several informative metrics, 
including average exclusivity and semantic coherence, to assist in the selection 
process.  
 
5. Estimating the structural topic model (STM):  After determining the optimal number 
of topics, the next crucial step is to estimate the STM. This process involves using 
various functions to assess, comprehend, and visualize the fitted model object. One 
key advantage of STM is its ability to incorporat e metadata into the topic modeling 
framework, enhancing the analysis in two ways:  
 
• topical prevalence:  Metadata covariates for topical prevalence enable the 
observed metadata to influence how frequently a topic is discussed.  
• topical content:  Covariates in topical content allow the observed metadata to 
affect the rate of word usage within a specific topic, shaping how that topic is 
discussed.  
 
When running the STM model, multiple arguments will be used, including the output from the 
prepDocuments  () function, which provides a documents column, a vocab column, and a meta 
column. The number of topics (K) identified using the ""searchK"" function will also be specified. 
Additionally, the ""init.type"" will be set to ""Spectral."" Lastly, the ""prevalence"" a rgument will be  
Page 7:
 
Page. 7  
 utilized to specify the metadata variables of interest as covariates, represented as an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and ""ndd_lvl.""  
 
6. Interpreting STM model results:  Once a suitable model has been chosen, the next 
crucial step involves interpreting the results. There are various methods to explore the 
output and gain insights from the STM model. The stm package provides several 
options to investigate and analyse the m odel's outcomes:  
 
• Displaying words associated with Topics : The “labelTopics”  function, along 
with the plot method for 'STM' objects (with the argument type = ""labels""), and the 
“sageLabels”  function (with the plot method for 'STM' objects, using the argument 
type = ""perspectives""), allow users to view the words closely associated with each 
topic. Additionally, the “findThoughts”  and “plotQuote”  functions are useful for 
identifying documents that have strong associations with specific topics.  
• Estimating relationships between Metadata and Topics:  The “estimateEffect”  
function can be employed to estimate the relationships between metadata 
variables and topics, as well as the topical content. This facilitates understanding 
how certain metadata covariates influence the prevalence and content of different 
topics.  
• Calculating Topic Correlations:  To measure the correlations between different 
topics, the “topicCorr”  function can be utilized, providing valuable insights into 
the relationships between various topics within the model.  
 
7. Shiny Application for inspecting STM results:  The “stminsights”  package in R 
enables interactive validation, interpretation, and visualization of one or several 
Structural Topic Models (STM).  
 
8. Stupid Back -off (SBO) model  – The “sbo” package in R will be used using the N -
gram model to build a predictive model that will take space -time stamp  and stress 
conditions to predict the next word(s).  
Results  
 
I.Determining the number of topics  
 
To identify the optimal number of topics for the analysis, the searchK function from the STM 
package in R will be utilized. This function takes several arguments, including the output from 
the prepDocuments() function. The number of topics (K) will be expl ored in the range of 30 to 
100. Additionally, the ""init.type"" parameter will be set to ""Spectral"" to improve the initialization 
process. Furthermore, the ""prevalence"" argument will be specified, allowing for the inclusion of 
metadata variables as covariate s, represented as an interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and 
""ndd_lvl."" This data -driven approach will help determine the most appropriate number of topics 
to be used by comparing the exclusivity and sematic scores between topics in the subsequent 
analysis.  
 
The results presented in Figure A showcase four key metrics used to assess the model 
quality: held -out likelihood, residual dispersion, topic semantic coherence, and the 
Page 8:
 
Page. 8  
 approximation to the lower -bound of the marginal likelihood. The objective is to maximize the 
held-out likelihood, semantic coherence, and lower -bound while minimizing the dispersion of 
residuals. These metrics collectively aid in determining the most reli able and robust model for 
the analysis.  
 
Figure A: Diagnostic Values for STM Model  (Sequence of Topics 30 -100) 
 
 
 
To evaluate the strength of the modelled topics and choose the appropriate number of topics 
for the analysis, we refer to Figure A.1, which displays a comparison of different STM models 
with varying numbers of topics. Models with K = 30 and K = 40 exhibit a narrower spread of 
topics towards the right side, and both models contain some topics that are considered 
outliers. On the other hand, models with K = 80 and K = 90 show a more favorable spread of 
topics towards the right, indicating a better distribution. Among these models, model 90 stands 
out, as it contains numerous topics with high exclusivity and semantic scores, making it the 
most suitable choice for further analysis.

II.Interpreting the STM by plotting and inspecting res ults 
 
After selecting the appropriate model with the desired number of topics, the next crucial step is 
to interpret the results of the STM model. The ""stm"" package offers several functions to 
explore the model's outcomes effectively. One such approach is to examine collections of 
words associated with each topic using the ""labelTopics"" function. Figure A.2 ill ustrates a 
sample output of the STM model, presenting four types of word weightings:  
 
• Highest Probability : This includes words within each topic with the highest probability, 
directly inferred from the topic -word distribution parameter β.  
• FREX:  Words are weighted based on their overall frequency and their exclusivity to the 
topic.  
• Lift: Words are weighted by dividing their frequency in the current topic by their 
frequency in other topics, giving higher weight to words that appear less frequently in 
other topics.  
• Score:  This weighting divides the log frequency of the word in the current topic by the 
log frequency of the word in other topics.  
 
It is advisable to prioritize using FREX words as they highlight words that carry significant 
weight and are unique to each topic. As evident in Figure A.2, Topic 22 is associated with 
farmers seeking information on grazing and breeds through the iShamba p latform, while Topic 
3 and Topic 47 both lack any coherent association with a specific topic. Additionally, Topic 68

 discusses harvest -related matters, and Topic 83 focuses on farmers seeking advice and 
assistance from the iShamba platform regarding farming activities.

Another valuable approach is to estimate the relationships between metadata and topics using 
the ""estimateEffect""  function. These relationships play a crucial role in validating the topic 
model's effectiveness (Grimmer 2010; Grimmer and Stewart 2013). This function performs 
regression, treating documents as the units, the proportion of each document about a topic in 
an STM model as the outcome, and document metadata as covariates. The method of 
composition is used to incorporate measurement uncertainty from the STM model. The 
""estimateEffect""  function requires several arguments, including the formula representing an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl""  and "" ndd_lvl"",  the output of the STM model, and the metadata. 
The ""uncertainty""  parameter is set to ""Global""  by default, which considers the estimation 
uncertainty of topic proportions in the uncertainty estimates using the method of composition. 
Alternatively, users can choose ""None""  for uncertainty if they do not wish to propagate the full 
amount of uncertainty, which might result in narrower confidence intervals due to the exclusion 
of additional estimation uncertainty. When calling ""summary"" on the ""estimateEffect""  object, a 
regression table (Roberts, Margaret E., Brandon M. Stewart, and Dustin Tingley 2019) will be 
generated, providing valuable insights into the relationships between metadata and topics.  
 
The proportion of the data that is yes/no from 71,105 observations is as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl  are both “yes” – 26,315 observations.  
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl are both “no” – 4,265 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “yes” and ndd_lvl is “no” – 9,451 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “no” and ndd_lvl is “yes” – 31,074 observations.

Table 1 presents the outcomes derived from the ""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 3, 22, 47, 
68, and 83. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific topic, outlining associated terms, 
their respective estimates, standard errors, and p -values. The i ntercept in the table signifies 
instances where both THI and NDD stress levels are categorized as ""no stress."" Notably, this 
intercept remains statistically significant across all 90 topics.  
 
A broad interpretation of the model suggests that when comparing the intercept, symbolizing 
""no stress,"" to scenarios where THI and NDD indicate stress levels, the model tends to 
generate a list of more generic words and topics. This outcome is likely due to the climate 
conditions being categorized as ""no stress,"" indicating that farmers are less concerned about 
weather's impact on their agricultural activities.  
 
It's important to highlight that the model's output doesn't reveal any terms related to livestock 
or weather, indicating that the model is not performing as expected.

To explore the depth of the relationship between SMSs and topics, the ""findThoughts""  function 
is employed. Figure A.3 presents the top five SMSs associated with Topics 3, 22, and 47. 
Observing Figure A.3, it becomes evident that the received SMSs pertain to various queries 
without specific relevance to livestock or livestock feed crops. I t can be inferred that this 
interaction model did not yield the anticipated outcomes, as the associated words with topics

 seemed random and lacked the specificity needed to discern the nature of livestock -related 
inquiries that farmers seek from the iShamba platform.  
 
 
 
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the types of queries sent by 
livestock farmers to the iShamba platform and to enhance the platform's advisory capabilities 
based on the findings from this analysis. The interaction regression model yielded words that 
were associated with the ""no stress"" category. This outcome can be attributed to the simplified 
model, where classes of THI and N DD were simplified, leading the model to recognize words 
related to the ""no stress"" scenario.  
 
Shifting the focus away from the interaction model between THI and NDD, we proceeded to 
conduct separate regression analyses for THI and NDD. To facilitate this, both covariates were 
reverted to their original categorical forms:  
 
• For “ thi”:2 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized  as ""no stress""  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress""  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
 
• For “ndd”:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress""

 • NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress""  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress""  
 
 
Upon a more in-depth analysis of the data, a significant pattern has emerged. SMSs flagged 
with ""mild"" and ""moderate"" stress levels for THI collectively constitute 50.27% of the dataset. 
In contrast, for NDD, SMSs indicated as having ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and ""extreme "" stress 
levels make up a substantial portion, accounting for a total of 80.77% of the data. Notably, THI 
shows no distinct disparity between ""no stress"" and stress levels. Additionally, it's important to 
highlight that the THI data lacks instances of ""sev ere"" stress.  
 
The probability of selecting an SMS labeled with ""no stress"" as compared to stress levels 
labeled ""mild"" or ""moderate"" for THI stands at 50%. Due to this equal distribution, it becomes 
challenging for the THI model to effectively discern stress -related key words.  
 
In contrast, the prevalence of stress levels, encompassing ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and 
""extreme,"" is notably higher with NDD. Stress levels make up 80.77% of the data, whereas ""no 
stress"" levels constitute only 19.23%. Consequently, the NDD model is anticipa ted to 
effectively identify stress -related words and topics. Therefore, the subsequent ""estimateEffect"" 
results concentrate on scenarios where NDD serves as the covariate.  
 
The same STM model logic was applied to the NDD model, but this time the model had only 
one covariate with the four classes of NDD mentioned above. The searchK function was 
executed to determine the appropriate number of topics, and it also yielded K = 90,  indicating 
a more favorable distribution of topics towards the right side. This distribution suggests a 
better overall topic coverage. Figure A.4 below displays the outcomes of the STM model for 
NDD. Notably, this model generated more words that are close ly related to livestock or 
livestock feed.  
 
For instance, the “labelTopics” plot below , Topic 43 delves into crops such as millet, cassava, 
and peas that could be used for feeding livestock. On the other hand, Topic 63 addresses 
pesticide control for crops, which affects the well -being of livestock . Furthermore, Topic 48 
touches upon financial aspects, indicating that farmers might seek loans for their farms or 
intend to purchase more livestock. Meanwhile, Topic 58 addresses farmers' concerns about 
climate change and the prevailing conditions that m ay impact their farming activities in the 
present and future.

 Figure A.4: Example of the output of NDD STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
Table 2, presented below, displays the regression outcomes derived from the NDD 
""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. The intercept within the table signifies 
the context where NDD stress level is classified as ""extreme stress."" Importantly, this intercept 
exhibits statistical significance across all 90 topics.  
 
Interpreting the model's outcomes reveals that for Topics 43 and 63, any incremental 
alteration in NDD stress levels classified as ""extreme stress"" elicits a shift in farmers' concerns 
towards crop -related issues and pesticide control. This alignment is ob servable in Figure A.4.  
 
As NDD conditions become more severe, observed through the significance of ""severe stress"" 
in Topic 58 at a 0.001 significance level, an increase of -0.0010 in NDD stress level appears to 
prompt farmers' apprehensions about climate conditions and their potential impact on farming 
activities. This prompts them to seek guidance from the iShamba platform before conditions 
escalate to the level of “extreme stress”.

To delve further into the intricacies of the relationship between SMSs and topics, Figure A.5 
showcases the top four SMSs associated with Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. It can be observed 
that the SMSs from farmers exhibit a strong correlation with topics related to livestock, climate, 
pesticides, and crops. However, it's important to note that this mo del also generated topics 
with seemingly random and basic words that are not inherently connected to livestock. This 
might be attributed to the presence of noise within the dataset, introducing some level of 
uncertainty.  
 
Page 16:
 
Page. 16  
  
 
To explore deeper into the results of the Estimateeffect model, we specifically focused on 
topics where a distinct difference was evident between the intercept (extreme stress) and no 
stress. This analysis led to the identification of approximately 52 such  topics. For each of these 
topics, we utilized the findthoughts function to extract 100 SMSs, resulting in a total of 5200 
observations.  
 
From these 5200 SMSs, we associated them with the corresponding wards by referencing the 
original dataset. Astonishingly, only 83 unique wards were represented out of the total 1450 
wards in the complete dataset.  
 
Further filtering was applied to isolate SMSs inquiring about climate, rain, and weather. This 
refinement resulted in 277 observations. Among these, 82 unique wards were found to have 
sent climate -related queries to the iShamba platform.

like iShamba. The goal is to develop a high -resolution, targeted, and timely advisory package for 
livestock far mers through these platforms. The dataset comprises 319,569 records of text

 Introduction  
 
iShamba, part of MediaE company, is a call centre  staffed by agricultural professionals where 
farmers can SMS in their inquiries or phone in for immediate assistance. Along with the weather 
updates and market prices, iShamba offers Agri -tips on crops and livestock after a farmer signs up. 
Farmers can eit her sign up for free or choose a premium plan for a small fee per year.  
Overview  
 
The Climate Action team's Livestock and Climate Initiative project, led by Scientist Dharani Dhar 
Burra, is interested in understanding historical messaging patterns and their correlation with 
climate hazards data from livestock farmers' current interactio ns with agriculture service provider 
platforms like iShamba. This information will further help to develop a high resolution targeted/ 
timely advisory package for livestock farmers through the service provider platforms.  
Objectives  
 
This project will aim to:  
 
1. Understand current trends/patterns of historical interactions of farmers with the iShamba 
platform.  
2. Identify if there is a pattern between messaging from farmers and climate hazards.  
3. We can then estimate farmers information requirements much ahead of time based on the 
forecasted climate hazards.  
4. This pre -emption of information requirement will then help us build more targeted advisory 
packages for the livestock farmers.  
5. Assess the applicability of the targeted advisories sent to the farmers through surveys.  
Data  
 
This project aims to analyze unstructured data from the iShamba platform, specifically text 
messages sent by farmers between the years 2015 to 2022. The initial plan was to utilize two 
years of data, but after preliminary data processing, many cases were d ropped due to incomplete 
or one -word messages received from the farmers, leading to a significant drop in the number of 
observations.         
 
The dataset received from the iShamba platform for the specified years contains 319,569 records. 
However, after data pre -processing and filtering to include only livestock -specific messages, and 
manually deleting duplicate SMS messages, the final sample si ze for this study is 72,062, with no 
missing data in the dataset.   
 
The variables included in the dataset are Task ID, Customer ID, Date, Time, Description, 
SMS sent by farmers, Responses to SMS, Assignees, Priority, SMS Tags, County, Sub - 
County, Wards, and x and y location points. The analysis will focus on the following  
variables:

 • Date - a character variable recorded by the platform for every farmer's inquiry received. The 
year and month will be extracted to calculate climate hazards later in the analysis.  
• SMS sent by farmers - a character variable containing the text messages received by 
farmers on the iShamba platform.  
• Sub-county - a character variable that records the county location of the farmer.  
• Ward - a character variable that records the sub -county location of the farmer.  
 
The number of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) are both recognized to reduce 
the productivity of livestock. However, the Agriculture Adaptation Atlas does not provide the mean 
number of NDD and THI for the years 2015 -2022. Therefore, bo th climate hazards were computed 
monthly for each year and ward using a projected climate hazards model. This will help to develop 
a relationship between the text messages received by farmers and both climate hazards. The 
overall goal of this relationship is to project future advisories that iShamba can send to livestock 
farmers regarding climate hazards at appropriate time in their location.  
 
Methodology  
 
I.Data Pre -Processing  
 
The data pre -processing for this project was conducted using R, due to the unstructured 
nature of the data. The initial step involved the removal of special characters, numbers, 
brackets, and quotes. This was followed by the separation of the time and date into new 
variables to extract the year and month for calculating the mean climate hazards in later 
analysis.  
 
The third step of the pre -processing included trimming the white spaces between text, 
selecting SMS messages that had a character count of 3 or above, and converting all text to 
lowercase. Additionally, some misspelled words in the SMS sent by farmers colu mn were 
corrected to enhance the accuracy of the subsequent analysis.  
 
A total of 140 wards were missing in the dataset, but their location points X and Y were 
available. To obtain the names of these wards, a join was performed with a Kenya shapefile 
dataset using the X and Y location points. This allowed for the extraction of the missing ward 
names, completing the dataset. Finally, records of counties that were not in Kenya and rows 
with ""NA"" across the county, sub -county, ward, and X and Y location points were dropped. The 
resulting p re-processed dataset had 252,759 observations.  
 
II.Filtering data to livestock  
 
To filter the dataset to focus only on livestock -related queries, a text analysis was performed 
using the ""Tm"" package in R to tokenize the SMS messages into words. A total of 264 words 
were removed, including non -English words and common words that were n ot relevant to the 
analysis. This resulted in a list of 81,114 unique words. The tokenized words list was then 
shared with iShamba to identify livestock -related words, which were flagged as ""high,"" while 
words that were not related to livestock were flagged as ""low."" This process yielded a list of 
Page 5:
 
Page. 5  
 5,956 unique words related to livestock. These words were used to filter the text messages to 
only include those that contained one or more words related to livestock.  
 
This filtering process resulted in a dataset of 78,169 observations. However, to eliminate 
duplicate SMS messages, a manual deletion process was conducted, resulting in a reduced 
dataset of 72,062 observations. A join operation was performed by creating a file containing 
unique IDs of sub -counties and wards, which was then merged with the filtered text data.  
 
To compute the monthly NDD and THI values for each ward, the same computation steps 
used for the development of the global adaptation atlas ( AdaptationAtlas - hazards ) were 
applied. The resulting data was aggregated to obtain average values for each month/year and 
ward. These average values were appended to the iShamba dataset, which contained the 
corresponding month, year, and ward for each SMS message.  
 
To facilitate analysis and interpretation, the NDD and THI values were transformed into new 
binary categorical variables as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl: a character variable defined as1: 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress"" = “yes”,  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”.  
 
• ndd_lvl: a character variable defined as:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress"" = “yes”.  
 
Consequently, the final dataset consists of 72,062 observations and includes six variables: 
SMS (actual) by farmers, month, year, ward, thi_lvl, and ndd_lvl. This filtered dataset was 
used for the subsequent analysis.  
 
III.Analysis  
 
Structural Topic Model (STM) provides a variety of statistical approaches for analyzing text 
data. The STM allows one to discover topics and estimate their relationship to document 
metadata. The  “stm” package in R provides tools to facilitate the workflow associated with 
analyzing textual data and users have a broad array of options to process raw text data, 
explore and analyze the data, and present findings using a variety of plotting tools.  
 
The steps involved in the STM topic prevalence model are as follows:  
 
1. Loading the data in R:  The ""stm"" package represents the text corpus in three parts:  
 
• A documents list containing word indices and their associated counts.  
 
1 The iShamba data has no THI “sever stress” cases.  
Page 6:
 
Page. 6  
 • A vocab character vector containing the words associated with the word indices.  
• A metadata matrix containing document covariates.  
 
2. Applying the ""textProcessor"" function:  This function is used to preprocess the data 
by removing punctuation, eliminating stop words, and stemming the words. It leverages 
the ""tm"" package and can be applied across multiple languages.  
 
3. Using the utility function ""prepDocuments"":  This function processes the loaded 
data to ensure it is in the correct format. It can also remove infrequent terms based on 
a user -set parameter called ""lower.thresh."" Additionally, ""prepDocuments""  will re -
index all metadata and document relationships if any changes occur during the 
processing. If a document is completely removed due to preprocessing (e.g., if it 
contained only rare words), the corresponding row in the metadata will be dropped. It i s 
important to inspect the document features and vocabulary list after reading and 
processing the text data to verify that the preprocessing steps have been applied 
correctly . 
 
These steps are crucial for preparing the data for the subsequent stages of the STM topic 
prevalence model. After the data import process in steps 2 and 3, the text corpus includes of 
71,105 documents and 16,467 tokens.  
 
4. Exploration of Topic Model s: Determining the optimal number of topics for a given 
corpus is not a straightforward task (Grimmer and Stewart 2013). To address this 
challenge, the ""searchK""  function employs a data -driven approach to select the 
appropriate number of topics. This function conducts various automated tests, such as 
calculating the held -out likelihood (Wallach et al. 2009) and performing residual 
analysis (Taddy 2012). By default , the ""Spectral""  initialization method is used due to 
its stability. Additionally, the ""searchK""  function computes several informative metrics, 
including average exclusivity and semantic coherence, to assist in the selection 
process.  
 
5. Estimating the structural topic model (STM):  After determining the optimal number 
of topics, the next crucial step is to estimate the STM. This process involves using 
various functions to assess, comprehend, and visualize the fitted model object. One 
key advantage of STM is its ability to incorporat e metadata into the topic modeling 
framework, enhancing the analysis in two ways:  
 
• topical prevalence:  Metadata covariates for topical prevalence enable the 
observed metadata to influence how frequently a topic is discussed.  
• topical content:  Covariates in topical content allow the observed metadata to 
affect the rate of word usage within a specific topic, shaping how that topic is 
discussed.  
 
When running the STM model, multiple arguments will be used, including the output from the 
prepDocuments  () function, which provides a documents column, a vocab column, and a meta 
column. The number of topics (K) identified using the ""searchK"" function will also be specified. 
Additionally, the ""init.type"" will be set to ""Spectral."" Lastly, the ""prevalence"" a rgument will be  
Page 7:
 
Page. 7  
 utilized to specify the metadata variables of interest as covariates, represented as an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and ""ndd_lvl.""  
 
6. Interpreting STM model results:  Once a suitable model has been chosen, the next 
crucial step involves interpreting the results. There are various methods to explore the 
output and gain insights from the STM model. The stm package provides several 
options to investigate and analyse the m odel's outcomes:  
 
• Displaying words associated with Topics : The “labelTopics”  function, along 
with the plot method for 'STM' objects (with the argument type = ""labels""), and the 
“sageLabels”  function (with the plot method for 'STM' objects, using the argument 
type = ""perspectives""), allow users to view the words closely associated with each 
topic. Additionally, the “findThoughts”  and “plotQuote”  functions are useful for 
identifying documents that have strong associations with specific topics.  
• Estimating relationships between Metadata and Topics:  The “estimateEffect”  
function can be employed to estimate the relationships between metadata 
variables and topics, as well as the topical content. This facilitates understanding 
how certain metadata covariates influence the prevalence and content of different 
topics.  
• Calculating Topic Correlations:  To measure the correlations between different 
topics, the “topicCorr”  function can be utilized, providing valuable insights into 
the relationships between various topics within the model.  
 
7. Shiny Application for inspecting STM results:  The “stminsights”  package in R 
enables interactive validation, interpretation, and visualization of one or several 
Structural Topic Models (STM).  
 
8. Stupid Back -off (SBO) model  – The “sbo” package in R will be used using the N -
gram model to build a predictive model that will take space -time stamp  and stress 
conditions to predict the next word(s).  
Results  
 
I.Determining the number of topics  
 
To identify the optimal number of topics for the analysis, the searchK function from the STM 
package in R will be utilized. This function takes several arguments, including the output from 
the prepDocuments() function. The number of topics (K) will be expl ored in the range of 30 to 
100. Additionally, the ""init.type"" parameter will be set to ""Spectral"" to improve the initialization 
process. Furthermore, the ""prevalence"" argument will be specified, allowing for the inclusion of 
metadata variables as covariate s, represented as an interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and 
""ndd_lvl."" This data -driven approach will help determine the most appropriate number of topics 
to be used by comparing the exclusivity and sematic scores between topics in the subsequent 
analysis.  
 
The results presented in Figure A showcase four key metrics used to assess the model 
quality: held -out likelihood, residual dispersion, topic semantic coherence, and the 
Page 8:
 
Page. 8  
 approximation to the lower -bound of the marginal likelihood. The objective is to maximize the 
held-out likelihood, semantic coherence, and lower -bound while minimizing the dispersion of 
residuals. These metrics collectively aid in determining the most reli able and robust model for 
the analysis.  
 
Figure A: Diagnostic Values for STM Model  (Sequence of Topics 30 -100) 
 
 
 
To evaluate the strength of the modelled topics and choose the appropriate number of topics 
for the analysis, we refer to Figure A.1, which displays a comparison of different STM models 
with varying numbers of topics. Models with K = 30 and K = 40 exhibit a narrower spread of 
topics towards the right side, and both models contain some topics that are considered 
outliers. On the other hand, models with K = 80 and K = 90 show a more favorable spread of 
topics towards the right, indicating a better distribution. Among these models, model 90 stands 
out, as it contains numerous topics with high exclusivity and semantic scores, making it the 
most suitable choice for further analysis.

II.Interpreting the STM by plotting and inspecting res ults 
 
After selecting the appropriate model with the desired number of topics, the next crucial step is 
to interpret the results of the STM model. The ""stm"" package offers several functions to 
explore the model's outcomes effectively. One such approach is to examine collections of 
words associated with each topic using the ""labelTopics"" function. Figure A.2 ill ustrates a 
sample output of the STM model, presenting four types of word weightings:  
 
• Highest Probability : This includes words within each topic with the highest probability, 
directly inferred from the topic -word distribution parameter β.  
• FREX:  Words are weighted based on their overall frequency and their exclusivity to the 
topic.  
• Lift: Words are weighted by dividing their frequency in the current topic by their 
frequency in other topics, giving higher weight to words that appear less frequently in 
other topics.  
• Score:  This weighting divides the log frequency of the word in the current topic by the 
log frequency of the word in other topics.  
 
It is advisable to prioritize using FREX words as they highlight words that carry significant 
weight and are unique to each topic. As evident in Figure A.2, Topic 22 is associated with 
farmers seeking information on grazing and breeds through the iShamba p latform, while Topic 
3 and Topic 47 both lack any coherent association with a specific topic. Additionally, Topic 68 
Page 10:
 
Page. 10  
 discusses harvest -related matters, and Topic 83 focuses on farmers seeking advice and 
assistance from the iShamba platform regarding farming activities.  
 
Figure A .2: Example of the output of STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
 
Another valuable approach is to estimate the relationships between metadata and topics using 
the ""estimateEffect""  function. These relationships play a crucial role in validating the topic 
model's effectiveness (Grimmer 2010; Grimmer and Stewart 2013). This function performs 
regression, treating documents as the units, the proportion of each document about a topic in 
an STM model as the outcome, and document metadata as covariates. The method of 
composition is used to incorporate measurement uncertainty from the STM model. The 
""estimateEffect""  function requires several arguments, including the formula representing an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl""  and "" ndd_lvl"",  the output of the STM model, and the metadata. 
The ""uncertainty""  parameter is set to ""Global""  by default, which considers the estimation 
uncertainty of topic proportions in the uncertainty estimates using the method of composition. 
Alternatively, users can choose ""None""  for uncertainty if they do not wish to propagate the full 
amount of uncertainty, which might result in narrower confidence intervals due to the exclusion 
of additional estimation uncertainty. When calling ""summary"" on the ""estimateEffect""  object, a 
regression table (Roberts, Margaret E., Brandon M. Stewart, and Dustin Tingley 2019) will be 
generated, providing valuable insights into the relationships between metadata and topics.  
 
The proportion of the data that is yes/no from 71,105 observations is as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl  are both “yes” – 26,315 observations.  
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl are both “no” – 4,265 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “yes” and ndd_lvl is “no” – 9,451 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “no” and ndd_lvl is “yes” – 31,074 observations.  
Page 11:
 
Page. 11  
  
Table 1 presents the outcomes derived from the ""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 3, 22, 47, 
68, and 83. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific topic, outlining associated terms, 
their respective estimates, standard errors, and p -values. The i ntercept in the table signifies 
instances where both THI and NDD stress levels are categorized as ""no stress."" Notably, this 
intercept remains statistically significant across all 90 topics.  
 
A broad interpretation of the model suggests that when comparing the intercept, symbolizing 
""no stress,"" to scenarios where THI and NDD indicate stress levels, the model tends to 
generate a list of more generic words and topics. This outcome is likely due to the climate 
conditions being categorized as ""no stress,"" indicating that farmers are less concerned about 
weather's impact on their agricultural activities.  
 
It's important to highlight that the model's output doesn't reveal any terms related to livestock 
or weather, indicating that the model is not performing as expected.

            Intercept here is defined as THI and NDD = “no stress”  
 
To explore the depth of the relationship between SMSs and topics, the ""findThoughts""  function 
is employed. Figure A.3 presents the top five SMSs associated with Topics 3, 22, and 47. 
Observing Figure A.3, it becomes evident that the received SMSs pertain to various queries 
without specific relevance to livestock or livestock feed crops. I t can be inferred that this 
interaction model did not yield the anticipated outcomes, as the associated words with topics

 seemed random and lacked the specificity needed to discern the nature of livestock -related 
inquiries that farmers seek from the iShamba platform.  
 
 
 
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the types of queries sent by 
livestock farmers to the iShamba platform and to enhance the platform's advisory capabilities 
based on the findings from this analysis. The interaction regression model yielded words that 
were associated with the ""no stress"" category. This outcome can be attributed to the simplified 
model, where classes of THI and N DD were simplified, leading the model to recognize words 
related to the ""no stress"" scenario.  
 
Shifting the focus away from the interaction model between THI and NDD, we proceeded to 
conduct separate regression analyses for THI and NDD. To facilitate this, both covariates were 
reverted to their original categorical forms:  
 
• For “ thi”:2 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized  as ""no stress""  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress""  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
 
• For “ndd”:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress""

 • NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress""  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress""  
 
 
Upon a more in-depth analysis of the data, a significant pattern has emerged. SMSs flagged 
with ""mild"" and ""moderate"" stress levels for THI collectively constitute 50.27% of the dataset. 
In contrast, for NDD, SMSs indicated as having ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and ""extreme "" stress 
levels make up a substantial portion, accounting for a total of 80.77% of the data. Notably, THI 
shows no distinct disparity between ""no stress"" and stress levels. Additionally, it's important to 
highlight that the THI data lacks instances of ""sev ere"" stress.  
 
The probability of selecting an SMS labeled with ""no stress"" as compared to stress levels 
labeled ""mild"" or ""moderate"" for THI stands at 50%. Due to this equal distribution, it becomes 
challenging for the THI model to effectively discern stress -related key words.  
 
In contrast, the prevalence of stress levels, encompassing ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and 
""extreme,"" is notably higher with NDD. Stress levels make up 80.77% of the data, whereas ""no 
stress"" levels constitute only 19.23%. Consequently, the NDD model is anticipa ted to 
effectively identify stress -related words and topics. Therefore, the subsequent ""estimateEffect"" 
results concentrate on scenarios where NDD serves as the covariate.  
 
The same STM model logic was applied to the NDD model, but this time the model had only 
one covariate with the four classes of NDD mentioned above. The searchK function was 
executed to determine the appropriate number of topics, and it also yielded K = 90,  indicating 
a more favorable distribution of topics towards the right side. This distribution suggests a 
better overall topic coverage. Figure A.4 below displays the outcomes of the STM model for 
NDD. Notably, this model generated more words that are close ly related to livestock or 
livestock feed.  
 
For instance, the “labelTopics” plot below , Topic 43 delves into crops such as millet, cassava, 
and peas that could be used for feeding livestock. On the other hand, Topic 63 addresses 
pesticide control for crops, which affects the well -being of livestock . Furthermore, Topic 48 
touches upon financial aspects, indicating that farmers might seek loans for their farms or 
intend to purchase more livestock. Meanwhile, Topic 58 addresses farmers' concerns about 
climate change and the prevailing conditions that m ay impact their farming activities in the 
present and future.

 Figure A.4: Example of the output of NDD STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
Table 2, presented below, displays the regression outcomes derived from the NDD 
""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. The intercept within the table signifies 
the context where NDD stress level is classified as ""extreme stress."" Importantly, this intercept 
exhibits statistical significance across all 90 topics.  
 
Interpreting the model's outcomes reveals that for Topics 43 and 63, any incremental 
alteration in NDD stress levels classified as ""extreme stress"" elicits a shift in farmers' concerns 
towards crop -related issues and pesticide control. This alignment is ob servable in Figure A.4.  
 
As NDD conditions become more severe, observed through the significance of ""severe stress"" 
in Topic 58 at a 0.001 significance level, an increase of -0.0010 in NDD stress level appears to 
prompt farmers' apprehensions about climate conditions and their potential impact on farming 
activities. This prompts them to seek guidance from the iShamba platform before conditions 
escalate to the level of “extreme stress”.

To delve further into the intricacies of the relationship between SMSs and topics, Figure A.5 
showcases the top four SMSs associated with Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. It can be observed 
that the SMSs from farmers exhibit a strong correlation with topics related to livestock, climate, 
pesticides, and crops. However, it's important to note that this mo del also generated topics 
with seemingly random and basic words that are not inherently connected to livestock. This 
might be attributed to the presence of noise within the dataset, introducing some level of 
uncertainty.  
 
Page 16:
 
Page. 16  
  
 
To explore deeper into the results of the Estimateeffect model, we specifically focused on 
topics where a distinct difference was evident between the intercept (extreme stress) and no 
stress. This analysis led to the identification of approximately 52 such  topics. For each of these 
topics, we utilized the findthoughts function to extract 100 SMSs, resulting in a total of 5200 
observations.  
 
From these 5200 SMSs, we associated them with the corresponding wards by referencing the 
original dataset. Astonishingly, only 83 unique wards were represented out of the total 1450 
wards in the complete dataset.  
 
Further filtering was applied to isolate SMSs inquiring about climate, rain, and weather. This 
refinement resulted in 277 observations. Among these, 82 unique wards were found to have 
sent climate -related queries to the iShamba platform.

 Introduction  
 
iShamba, part of MediaE company, is a call centre  staffed by agricultural professionals where 
farmers can SMS in their inquiries or phone in for immediate assistance. Along with the weather 
updates and market prices, iShamba offers Agri -tips on crops and livestock after a farmer signs up. 
Farmers can eit her sign up for free or choose a premium plan for a small fee per year.  
Overview  
 
The Climate Action team's Livestock and Climate Initiative project, led by Scientist Dharani Dhar 
Burra, is interested in understanding historical messaging patterns and their correlation with 
climate hazards data from livestock farmers' current interactio ns with agriculture service provider 
platforms like iShamba. This information will further help to develop a high resolution targeted/ 
timely advisory package for livestock farmers through the service provider platforms.  
Objectives  
 
This project will aim to:  
 
1. Understand current trends/patterns of historical interactions of farmers with the iShamba 
platform.  
2. Identify if there is a pattern between messaging from farmers and climate hazards.  
3. We can then estimate farmers information requirements much ahead of time based on the 
forecasted climate hazards.  
4. This pre -emption of information requirement will then help us build more targeted advisory 
packages for the livestock farmers.  
5. Assess the applicability of the targeted advisories sent to the farmers through surveys.  
Data  
 
This project aims to analyze unstructured data from the iShamba platform, specifically text 
messages sent by farmers between the years 2015 to 2022. The initial plan was to utilize two 
years of data, but after preliminary data processing, many cases were d ropped due to incomplete 
or one -word messages received from the farmers, leading to a significant drop in the number of 
observations.         
 
The dataset received from the iShamba platform for the specified years contains 319,569 records. 
However, after data pre -processing and filtering to include only livestock -specific messages, and 
manually deleting duplicate SMS messages, the final sample si ze for this study is 72,062, with no 
missing data in the dataset.   
 
The variables included in the dataset are Task ID, Customer ID, Date, Time, Description, 
SMS sent by farmers, Responses to SMS, Assignees, Priority, SMS Tags, County, Sub - 
County, Wards, and x and y location points. The analysis will focus on the following  
variables:  
 
Page 4:
 
Page. 4  
 • Date - a character variable recorded by the platform for every farmer's inquiry received. The 
year and month will be extracted to calculate climate hazards later in the analysis.  
• SMS sent by farmers - a character variable containing the text messages received by 
farmers on the iShamba platform.  
• Sub-county - a character variable that records the county location of the farmer.  
• Ward - a character variable that records the sub -county location of the farmer.  
 
The number of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) are both recognized to reduce 
the productivity of livestock. However, the Agriculture Adaptation Atlas does not provide the mean 
number of NDD and THI for the years 2015 -2022. Therefore, bo th climate hazards were computed 
monthly for each year and ward using a projected climate hazards model. This will help to develop 
a relationship between the text messages received by farmers and both climate hazards. The 
overall goal of this relationship is to project future advisories that iShamba can send to livestock 
farmers regarding climate hazards at appropriate time in their location.  
 
Methodology  
 
I.Data Pre -Processing  
 
The data pre -processing for this project was conducted using R, due to the unstructured 
nature of the data. The initial step involved the removal of special characters, numbers, 
brackets, and quotes. This was followed by the separation of the time and date into new 
variables to extract the year and month for calculating the mean climate hazards in later 
analysis.  
 
The third step of the pre -processing included trimming the white spaces between text, 
selecting SMS messages that had a character count of 3 or above, and converting all text to 
lowercase. Additionally, some misspelled words in the SMS sent by farmers colu mn were 
corrected to enhance the accuracy of the subsequent analysis.  
 
A total of 140 wards were missing in the dataset, but their location points X and Y were 
available. To obtain the names of these wards, a join was performed with a Kenya shapefile 
dataset using the X and Y location points. This allowed for the extraction of the missing ward 
names, completing the dataset. Finally, records of counties that were not in Kenya and rows 
with ""NA"" across the county, sub -county, ward, and X and Y location points were dropped. The 
resulting p re-processed dataset had 252,759 observations.  
 
II.Filtering data to livestock  
 
To filter the dataset to focus only on livestock -related queries, a text analysis was performed 
using the ""Tm"" package in R to tokenize the SMS messages into words. A total of 264 words 
were removed, including non -English words and common words that were n ot relevant to the 
analysis. This resulted in a list of 81,114 unique words. The tokenized words list was then 
shared with iShamba to identify livestock -related words, which were flagged as ""high,"" while 
words that were not related to livestock were flagged as ""low."" This process yielded a list of 
Page 5:
 
Page. 5  
 5,956 unique words related to livestock. These words were used to filter the text messages to 
only include those that contained one or more words related to livestock.  
 
This filtering process resulted in a dataset of 78,169 observations. However, to eliminate 
duplicate SMS messages, a manual deletion process was conducted, resulting in a reduced 
dataset of 72,062 observations. A join operation was performed by creating a file containing 
unique IDs of sub -counties and wards, which was then merged with the filtered text data.  
 
To compute the monthly NDD and THI values for each ward, the same computation steps 
used for the development of the global adaptation atlas ( AdaptationAtlas - hazards ) were 
applied. The resulting data was aggregated to obtain average values for each month/year and 
ward. These average values were appended to the iShamba dataset, which contained the 
corresponding month, year, and ward for each SMS message.  
 
To facilitate analysis and interpretation, the NDD and THI values were transformed into new 
binary categorical variables as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl: a character variable defined as1: 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress"" = “yes”,  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”.  
 
• ndd_lvl: a character variable defined as:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress"" = “yes”.  
 
Consequently, the final dataset consists of 72,062 observations and includes six variables: 
SMS (actual) by farmers, month, year, ward, thi_lvl, and ndd_lvl. This filtered dataset was 
used for the subsequent analysis.  
 
III.Analysis  
 
Structural Topic Model (STM) provides a variety of statistical approaches for analyzing text 
data. The STM allows one to discover topics and estimate their relationship to document 
metadata. The  “stm” package in R provides tools to facilitate the workflow associated with 
analyzing textual data and users have a broad array of options to process raw text data, 
explore and analyze the data, and present findings using a variety of plotting tools.  
 
The steps involved in the STM topic prevalence model are as follows:  
 
1. Loading the data in R:  The ""stm"" package represents the text corpus in three parts:  
 
• A documents list containing word indices and their associated counts.  
 
1 The iShamba data has no THI “sever stress” cases.  
Page 6:
 
Page. 6  
 • A vocab character vector containing the words associated with the word indices.  
• A metadata matrix containing document covariates.  
 
2. Applying the ""textProcessor"" function:  This function is used to preprocess the data 
by removing punctuation, eliminating stop words, and stemming the words. It leverages 
the ""tm"" package and can be applied across multiple languages.  
 
3. Using the utility function ""prepDocuments"":  This function processes the loaded 
data to ensure it is in the correct format. It can also remove infrequent terms based on 
a user -set parameter called ""lower.thresh."" Additionally, ""prepDocuments""  will re -
index all metadata and document relationships if any changes occur during the 
processing. If a document is completely removed due to preprocessing (e.g., if it 
contained only rare words), the corresponding row in the metadata will be dropped. It i s 
important to inspect the document features and vocabulary list after reading and 
processing the text data to verify that the preprocessing steps have been applied 
correctly . 
 
These steps are crucial for preparing the data for the subsequent stages of the STM topic 
prevalence model. After the data import process in steps 2 and 3, the text corpus includes of 
71,105 documents and 16,467 tokens.  
 
4. Exploration of Topic Model s: Determining the optimal number of topics for a given 
corpus is not a straightforward task (Grimmer and Stewart 2013). To address this 
challenge, the ""searchK""  function employs a data -driven approach to select the 
appropriate number of topics. This function conducts various automated tests, such as 
calculating the held -out likelihood (Wallach et al. 2009) and performing residual 
analysis (Taddy 2012). By default , the ""Spectral""  initialization method is used due to 
its stability. Additionally, the ""searchK""  function computes several informative metrics, 
including average exclusivity and semantic coherence, to assist in the selection 
process.  
 
5. Estimating the structural topic model (STM):  After determining the optimal number 
of topics, the next crucial step is to estimate the STM. This process involves using 
various functions to assess, comprehend, and visualize the fitted model object. One 
key advantage of STM is its ability to incorporat e metadata into the topic modeling 
framework, enhancing the analysis in two ways:  
 
• topical prevalence:  Metadata covariates for topical prevalence enable the 
observed metadata to influence how frequently a topic is discussed.  
• topical content:  Covariates in topical content allow the observed metadata to 
affect the rate of word usage within a specific topic, shaping how that topic is 
discussed.  
 
When running the STM model, multiple arguments will be used, including the output from the 
prepDocuments  () function, which provides a documents column, a vocab column, and a meta 
column. The number of topics (K) identified using the ""searchK"" function will also be specified. 
Additionally, the ""init.type"" will be set to ""Spectral."" Lastly, the ""prevalence"" a rgument will be  
Page 7:
 
Page. 7  
 utilized to specify the metadata variables of interest as covariates, represented as an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and ""ndd_lvl.""  
 
6. Interpreting STM model results:  Once a suitable model has been chosen, the next 
crucial step involves interpreting the results. There are various methods to explore the 
output and gain insights from the STM model. The stm package provides several 
options to investigate and analyse the m odel's outcomes:  
 
• Displaying words associated with Topics : The “labelTopics”  function, along 
with the plot method for 'STM' objects (with the argument type = ""labels""), and the 
“sageLabels”  function (with the plot method for 'STM' objects, using the argument 
type = ""perspectives""), allow users to view the words closely associated with each 
topic. Additionally, the “findThoughts”  and “plotQuote”  functions are useful for 
identifying documents that have strong associations with specific topics.  
• Estimating relationships between Metadata and Topics:  The “estimateEffect”  
function can be employed to estimate the relationships between metadata 
variables and topics, as well as the topical content. This facilitates understanding 
how certain metadata covariates influence the prevalence and content of different 
topics.  
• Calculating Topic Correlations:  To measure the correlations between different 
topics, the “topicCorr”  function can be utilized, providing valuable insights into 
the relationships between various topics within the model.  
 
7. Shiny Application for inspecting STM results:  The “stminsights”  package in R 
enables interactive validation, interpretation, and visualization of one or several 
Structural Topic Models (STM).  
 
8. Stupid Back -off (SBO) model  – The “sbo” package in R will be used using the N -
gram model to build a predictive model that will take space -time stamp  and stress 
conditions to predict the next word(s).  
Results  
 
I.Determining the number of topics  
 
To identify the optimal number of topics for the analysis, the searchK function from the STM 
package in R will be utilized. This function takes several arguments, including the output from 
the prepDocuments() function. The number of topics (K) will be expl ored in the range of 30 to 
100. Additionally, the ""init.type"" parameter will be set to ""Spectral"" to improve the initialization 
process. Furthermore, the ""prevalence"" argument will be specified, allowing for the inclusion of 
metadata variables as covariate s, represented as an interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and 
""ndd_lvl."" This data -driven approach will help determine the most appropriate number of topics 
to be used by comparing the exclusivity and sematic scores between topics in the subsequent 
analysis.  
 
The results presented in Figure A showcase four key metrics used to assess the model 
quality: held -out likelihood, residual dispersion, topic semantic coherence, and the 
Page 8:
 
Page. 8  
 approximation to the lower -bound of the marginal likelihood. The objective is to maximize the 
held-out likelihood, semantic coherence, and lower -bound while minimizing the dispersion of 
residuals. These metrics collectively aid in determining the most reli able and robust model for 
the analysis.  
 
Figure A: Diagnostic Values for STM Model  (Sequence of Topics 30 -100) 
 
 
 
To evaluate the strength of the modelled topics and choose the appropriate number of topics 
for the analysis, we refer to Figure A.1, which displays a comparison of different STM models 
with varying numbers of topics. Models with K = 30 and K = 40 exhibit a narrower spread of 
topics towards the right side, and both models contain some topics that are considered 
outliers. On the other hand, models with K = 80 and K = 90 show a more favorable spread of 
topics towards the right, indicating a better distribution. Among these models, model 90 stands 
out, as it contains numerous topics with high exclusivity and semantic scores, making it the 
most suitable choice for further analysis.

II.Interpreting the STM by plotting and inspecting res ults 
 
After selecting the appropriate model with the desired number of topics, the next crucial step is 
to interpret the results of the STM model. The ""stm"" package offers several functions to 
explore the model's outcomes effectively. One such approach is to examine collections of 
words associated with each topic using the ""labelTopics"" function. Figure A.2 ill ustrates a 
sample output of the STM model, presenting four types of word weightings:  
 
• Highest Probability : This includes words within each topic with the highest probability, 
directly inferred from the topic -word distribution parameter β.  
• FREX:  Words are weighted based on their overall frequency and their exclusivity to the 
topic.  
• Lift: Words are weighted by dividing their frequency in the current topic by their 
frequency in other topics, giving higher weight to words that appear less frequently in 
other topics.  
• Score:  This weighting divides the log frequency of the word in the current topic by the 
log frequency of the word in other topics.  
 
It is advisable to prioritize using FREX words as they highlight words that carry significant 
weight and are unique to each topic. As evident in Figure A.2, Topic 22 is associated with 
farmers seeking information on grazing and breeds through the iShamba p latform, while Topic 
3 and Topic 47 both lack any coherent association with a specific topic. Additionally, Topic 68 
Page 10:
 
Page. 10  
 discusses harvest -related matters, and Topic 83 focuses on farmers seeking advice and 
assistance from the iShamba platform regarding farming activities.  
 
Figure A .2: Example of the output of STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
 
Another valuable approach is to estimate the relationships between metadata and topics using 
the ""estimateEffect""  function. These relationships play a crucial role in validating the topic 
model's effectiveness (Grimmer 2010; Grimmer and Stewart 2013). This function performs 
regression, treating documents as the units, the proportion of each document about a topic in 
an STM model as the outcome, and document metadata as covariates. The method of 
composition is used to incorporate measurement uncertainty from the STM model. The 
""estimateEffect""  function requires several arguments, including the formula representing an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl""  and "" ndd_lvl"",  the output of the STM model, and the metadata. 
The ""uncertainty""  parameter is set to ""Global""  by default, which considers the estimation 
uncertainty of topic proportions in the uncertainty estimates using the method of composition. 
Alternatively, users can choose ""None""  for uncertainty if they do not wish to propagate the full 
amount of uncertainty, which might result in narrower confidence intervals due to the exclusion 
of additional estimation uncertainty. When calling ""summary"" on the ""estimateEffect""  object, a 
regression table (Roberts, Margaret E., Brandon M. Stewart, and Dustin Tingley 2019) will be 
generated, providing valuable insights into the relationships between metadata and topics.  
 
The proportion of the data that is yes/no from 71,105 observations is as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl  are both “yes” – 26,315 observations.  
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl are both “no” – 4,265 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “yes” and ndd_lvl is “no” – 9,451 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “no” and ndd_lvl is “yes” – 31,074 observations.  
Page 11:
 
Page. 11  
  
Table 1 presents the outcomes derived from the ""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 3, 22, 47, 
68, and 83. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific topic, outlining associated terms, 
their respective estimates, standard errors, and p -values. The i ntercept in the table signifies 
instances where both THI and NDD stress levels are categorized as ""no stress."" Notably, this 
intercept remains statistically significant across all 90 topics.  
 
A broad interpretation of the model suggests that when comparing the intercept, symbolizing 
""no stress,"" to scenarios where THI and NDD indicate stress levels, the model tends to 
generate a list of more generic words and topics. This outcome is likely due to the climate 
conditions being categorized as ""no stress,"" indicating that farmers are less concerned about 
weather's impact on their agricultural activities.  
 
It's important to highlight that the model's output doesn't reveal any terms related to livestock 
or weather, indicating that the model is not performing as expected.

To explore the depth of the relationship between SMSs and topics, the ""findThoughts""  function 
is employed. Figure A.3 presents the top five SMSs associated with Topics 3, 22, and 47. 
Observing Figure A.3, it becomes evident that the received SMSs pertain to various queries 
without specific relevance to livestock or livestock feed crops. I t can be inferred that this 
interaction model did not yield the anticipated outcomes, as the associated words with topics

 seemed random and lacked the specificity needed to discern the nature of livestock -related 
inquiries that farmers seek from the iShamba platform.  
 
 
 
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the types of queries sent by 
livestock farmers to the iShamba platform and to enhance the platform's advisory capabilities 
based on the findings from this analysis. The interaction regression model yielded words that 
were associated with the ""no stress"" category. This outcome can be attributed to the simplified 
model, where classes of THI and N DD were simplified, leading the model to recognize words 
related to the ""no stress"" scenario.  
 
Shifting the focus away from the interaction model between THI and NDD, we proceeded to 
conduct separate regression analyses for THI and NDD. To facilitate this, both covariates were 
reverted to their original categorical forms:  
 
• For “ thi”:2 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized  as ""no stress""  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress""  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
 
• For “ndd”:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress""

 • NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress""  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress""  
 
 
Upon a more in-depth analysis of the data, a significant pattern has emerged. SMSs flagged 
with ""mild"" and ""moderate"" stress levels for THI collectively constitute 50.27% of the dataset. 
In contrast, for NDD, SMSs indicated as having ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and ""extreme "" stress 
levels make up a substantial portion, accounting for a total of 80.77% of the data. Notably, THI 
shows no distinct disparity between ""no stress"" and stress levels. Additionally, it's important to 
highlight that the THI data lacks instances of ""sev ere"" stress.  
 
The probability of selecting an SMS labeled with ""no stress"" as compared to stress levels 
labeled ""mild"" or ""moderate"" for THI stands at 50%. Due to this equal distribution, it becomes 
challenging for the THI model to effectively discern stress -related key words.  
 
In contrast, the prevalence of stress levels, encompassing ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and 
""extreme,"" is notably higher with NDD. Stress levels make up 80.77% of the data, whereas ""no 
stress"" levels constitute only 19.23%. Consequently, the NDD model is anticipa ted to 
effectively identify stress -related words and topics. Therefore, the subsequent ""estimateEffect"" 
results concentrate on scenarios where NDD serves as the covariate.  
 
The same STM model logic was applied to the NDD model, but this time the model had only 
one covariate with the four classes of NDD mentioned above. The searchK function was 
executed to determine the appropriate number of topics, and it also yielded K = 90,  indicating 
a more favorable distribution of topics towards the right side. This distribution suggests a 
better overall topic coverage. Figure A.4 below displays the outcomes of the STM model for 
NDD. Notably, this model generated more words that are close ly related to livestock or 
livestock feed.  
 
For instance, the “labelTopics” plot below , Topic 43 delves into crops such as millet, cassava, 
and peas that could be used for feeding livestock. On the other hand, Topic 63 addresses 
pesticide control for crops, which affects the well -being of livestock . Furthermore, Topic 48 
touches upon financial aspects, indicating that farmers might seek loans for their farms or 
intend to purchase more livestock. Meanwhile, Topic 58 addresses farmers' concerns about 
climate change and the prevailing conditions that m ay impact their farming activities in the 
present and future.

 Figure A.4: Example of the output of NDD STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
Table 2, presented below, displays the regression outcomes derived from the NDD 
""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. The intercept within the table signifies 
the context where NDD stress level is classified as ""extreme stress."" Importantly, this intercept 
exhibits statistical significance across all 90 topics.  
 
Interpreting the model's outcomes reveals that for Topics 43 and 63, any incremental 
alteration in NDD stress levels classified as ""extreme stress"" elicits a shift in farmers' concerns 
towards crop -related issues and pesticide control. This alignment is ob servable in Figure A.4.  
 
As NDD conditions become more severe, observed through the significance of ""severe stress"" 
in Topic 58 at a 0.001 significance level, an increase of -0.0010 in NDD stress level appears to 
prompt farmers' apprehensions about climate conditions and their potential impact on farming 
activities. This prompts them to seek guidance from the iShamba platform before conditions 
escalate to the level of “extreme stress”.

To delve further into the intricacies of the relationship between SMSs and topics, Figure A.5 
showcases the top four SMSs associated with Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. It can be observed 
that the SMSs from farmers exhibit a strong correlation with topics related to livestock, climate, 
pesticides, and crops. However, it's important to note that this mo del also generated topics 
with seemingly random and basic words that are not inherently connected to livestock. This 
might be attributed to the presence of noise within the dataset, introducing some level of 
uncertainty.

To explore deeper into the results of the Estimateeffect model, we specifically focused on 
topics where a distinct difference was evident between the intercept (extreme stress) and no 
stress. This analysis led to the identification of approximately 52 such  topics. For each of these 
topics, we utilized the findthoughts function to extract 100 SMSs, resulting in a total of 5200 
observations.  
 
From these 5200 SMSs, we associated them with the corresponding wards by referencing the 
original dataset. Astonishingly, only 83 unique wards were represented out of the total 1450 
wards in the complete dataset.  
 
Further filtering was applied to isolate SMSs inquiring about climate, rain, and weather. This 
refinement resulted in 277 observations. Among these, 82 unique wards were found to have 
sent climate -related queries to the iShamba platform.
