### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity. 

3. **Assign the score:** Based on the scoring criteria provided, assign the most appropriate score (0, 1, or 2). 

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity. 

3. **Assign the score:** Based on the scoring criteria provided, assign the most appropriate score (0, 1, or 2). 

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2.

Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

Conservation agriculture for regenerating soil health and climate change mitigation in smallholder systems of South Asia The increase in agriculture production to meet the food demand of growing human population from a limited availability of arable land with low environmental footprints and preserving natural resources (soil, water and air) simultaneously are major challenges in South Asia. The situation is further complicated by the climate change, which will further lower the food production, compounding the challenge of meeting food demand. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is solution to several challenges being faced in farming such as soil health, climate change, water scarcity, agricultural pollution, farm profitability, human health, etc. This exhaustive review examines the published literature from South Asia to assess the impact of CA on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the subsequent impacts on soil health (physical, chemical and biological properties), C sequestration and greenhouse gases emissions in major cropping systems. The results from several studies demonstrated that CA increased SOC and improved soil health parameters, mainly in the surface soil layer. The effects of CA on the changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity are small. The CA showed a remarkable positive impact on the nutrient availability in the soil. The CA system helped in both climate change mitigation and adaptation for sustainable crop production.

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result.

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

The objectives of this study were to develop a precision SPVD phenotyping protocol, to find new SPVD-resistant genotypes, and to standardize the first stages of screening for SPVD resistance. The first part of the protocol was based on ELISA results for sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and sweet potato virus C (SPVC) with adjustments to a negative control (uninfected clone 'Tanzania') and was performed on a pre-breeding population (VZ08) comprising 455 clones and 27 check clones graft-inoculated under screenhouse conditions. The second part included field studies with 52 selected clones for SPCSV resistance from VZ08 and eight checks. In screenhouse conditions, the resistant and susceptible check clones performed as expected, 63 clones from VZ08 exhibited lower relative absorbance values for SPCSV and SPVC than inoculated check Tanzania. Field experiments confirmed SPVD resistance of several clones selected by relative absorbance values (nine resistant clones in two locations, i.e. 17.3% of the screenhouse selection), supporting the reliability of our method for SPVD-resistance selection. Two clones were promising, exhibiting high storage root yields of 28.7-34.9 t ha-1 and SPVD resistance, based on the proposed selection procedure. This modified serological analysis for SPVD-resistance phenotyping might lead to more efficient development of resistant varieties by reducing costs and time at early stages, and provide solid data for marker assisted selection with a quantitative tool for classifying resistance.","1437"

### **Context:** 

CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research on food systems. 

 

### **Research Result Components:** 

Each research result includes the following details: 

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

Climate changemay favour pest and disease development and further exacerbate the vulnerability of smallholder farming systems to biotic constraints. Information on effects of climate change on pests and pathogens of banana is required by policy
makers and researchers in designing control strategies and adaptation plans. Since altitude is inversely related to temperature, this study used the occurrence of key banana pests and diseases along an altitude gradient as a proxy for the potential impact of changes in temperature associated with global warming on pests and diseases. We assessed the occurrence of banana pests and diseases in 93 banana fields across three altitude ranges in Burundi and 99 fields distributed in two altitude ranges in Rwanda watersheds. Incidence and prevalence of Banana Bunchy Top Disease (BBTD) and Fusarium wilt (FW) was significantly associated with temperature and altitude in Burundi, revealing that increasing temperatures may lead to upward movement of banana diseases. No significant associations with temperature and altitude were observed for weevils,
nematodes and Xanthomonas wilt of banana (BXW). Data collected in this study provides a baseline to verify and guide modelling work to predict future pest and disease distribution according to climate change scenarios.

### **Context:** 

CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research on food systems. 

 

### **Research Result Components:** 

Each research result includes the following details: 

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result.

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

The goal is to develop a high-resolution, targeted, and timely advisory package for livestock farmers through these platforms. The dataset comprises 319,569 records of text messages sent by farmers via the iShamba platform between 2015 and 2022. After data pre-processing, including filtering for livestock-specific messages and removing duplicate SMS messages, the final sample size is 72,062, with no missing data.

Recognizing the impact of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) on livestock productivity, the analysis employs the Structural Topic Model (STM) package in R. This tool explores the optimal number of topics for topic modeling, visualizes results, estimates relationships between metadata and topics, creates a Shiny application for STM results, and utilizes the Stupid Back-Off (SBO) package in R to build a predictive model for the next word(s).

The results reveal that simplifying THI and NDD stress level classes did not yield expected outcomes, especially when compared to the more intricate model of NDD. The intricate model successfully identified stress-related words and SMSs. The findings emphasize that extreme weather conditions, such as prolonged absence of rain for over 25 days in a month, trigger farmer concerns about crop health and the impact of pesticides.

Each research result includes the following details: 

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result.

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

The wild relatives of this crop are deemed a vast potential source of useful alleles to adapt to this stress. A nested association mapping (NAM) panel was generated using as a recurrent parent the Moroccan variety ‘Nachit’ derived from Triticum dicoccoides and known for its large grain size. This was recombined to three top-performing lines derived from T. dicoccoides, T. araraticum, and Aegilops speltoides, for a total of 426 inbred progenies. This NAM was evaluated across eight environments (Syria, Lebanon, and Morocco) experiencing different degrees of terminal moisture stress over two crop seasons. Our results showed that drought stress caused on average 41% loss in yield and that 1,000-kernel weight (TKW) was the most important trait for adaptation to it. Genotyping with the 25K TraitGenetics array resulted in a consensus map of 1,678 polymorphic SNPs, spanning 1,723 cM aligned to the reference ‘Svevo’ genome assembly. Kinship distinguished the progenies in three clades matching the parent of origin. A total of 18 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified as controlling various traits but independent from flowering time. The most significant genomic regions were named Q.ICD.NAM-04, Q.ICD.NAM-14, and Q.ICD.NAM-16. Allelic investigation in a second germplasm panel confirmed that carrying the positive allele at all three loci produced an average TKW advantage of 25.6% when field-tested under drought conditions. The underlying SNPs were converted to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers and successfully validated in a third germplasm set, where they explained up to 19% of phenotypic variation for TKW under moisture stress. These findings confirm the identification of critical loci for drought adaptation derived from wild relatives that can now be readily exploited via molecular breeding.","1522"

The wild relatives of this crop are deemed a vast potential source of useful alleles to adapt to this stress. A nested association mapping (NAM) panel was generated using as a recurrent parent the Moroccan variety ‘Nachit’ derived from Triticum dicoccoides and known for its large grain size. This was recombined to three top-performing lines derived from T. dicoccoides, T. araraticum, and Aegilops speltoides, for a total of 426 inbred progenies. This NAM was evaluated across eight environments (Syria, Lebanon, and Morocco) experiencing different degrees of terminal moisture stress over two crop seasons. Our results showed that drought stress caused on average 41% loss in yield and that 1,000-kernel weight (TKW) was the most important trait for adaptation to it. Genotyping with the 25K TraitGenetics array resulted in a consensus map of 1,678 polymorphic SNPs, spanning 1,723 cM aligned to the reference ‘Svevo’ genome assembly. Kinship distinguished the progenies in three clades matching the parent of origin. A total of 18 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified as controlling various traits but independent from flowering time. The most significant genomic regions were named Q.ICD.NAM-04, Q.ICD.NAM-14, and Q.ICD.NAM-16.

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity. 

3. **Assign the score:** Based on the scoring criteria provided, assign the most appropriate score (0, 1, or 2). 

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

Integrated Agriculture-Aquaculture (IAA) systems are diversified farming systems where aquatic and terrestrial foods are grown together on the same plot using the resources from one to benefit the other. In Egypt, for example, the production of fish such as Nile tilapia, mullet, and African catfish creates nutrient-rich water that can then be used to irrigate crops such as date palm, olives, figs, pomegranates, guava, onions, sugar beets, and tomato. IAA includes a range of technologies and methods that can be put together and adapted to each farming situation as needed. IAA is one of the most promising and fastest-growing food production systems in Egypt since it enhances production diversity, land productivity, water efficiency and nutrient cycling on farms.","1483"

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Context:** 

CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research on food systems. 

 

### **Research Result Components:** 

Each research result includes the following details: 

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

Understanding how social heterogeneity, including gender, drives trait preferences is essential to ensure that crop improvement objectives meet farmers’ and stakeholder demands. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating social science knowledge with crop breeding. Although the necessity of interdisciplinary research is recognised and promoted, it is impeded by a multitude of challenges including ontological and epistemological differences, institutional and global hierarchies, disciplinary power relations and struggles for scientific authority. The Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D) sector is marked by entrenched power differentials, including dominance of the biophysical sciences, a historical emphasis on technical solutions which ignores social contexts, and the underrepresentation of women scientists and farmers themselves. Nevertheless, there is limited theoretically informed analysis of power dynamics within AR4D settings. Drawing on qualitative, ethnographic observations of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement (ILCI), this article seeks to understand how power affects interdisciplinary research processes. Critical ethnography and power theory is used to analyse power within international crop breeding collaborations and the implications for inclusive knowledge production and research impact. The Powercube is used to examine how visible, hidden and invisible forms of power manifest within local, national, and international relationships across closed, invited and claimed spaces. Our findings suggest that these intersecting power dimensions, which include disciplinary, gendered, institutional and global hierarchies, constrain the contributions that individual researchers can make – particularly social scientists – thereby hindering disciplinary integration. The ILCI case study reveals the complex multi-dimensional dynamics that emerge within agricultural research teams and highlights structural limitations constraining efforts to build socially inclusive and gender-responsive crop improvement programmes. The article contributes to a small but growing literature studying the social construction of agricultural science, and provides insights that can enable interdisciplinary research strategies to more effectively meet the needs of farmers and other stakeholders.","1471"

Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area score that reflects the relevance of the research result to the Impact Area as CGIAR defines it.** 

 

### **Context:** 

CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research on food systems. 

 

### **Research Result Components:** 

Each research result includes the following details: 

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity. 

3. **Assign the score:** Based on the scoring criteria provided, assign the most appropriate score (0, 1, or 2). 

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Research Result Components:** 

Each research result includes the following details: 

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity. 

3. **Assign the score:** Based on the scoring criteria provided, assign the most appropriate score (0, 1, or 2). 

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

A Comprehensive Review of Land Use, Food Systems, and Socio-Economic Drivers The drivers of deforestation and land use change in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes are complex and interconnected, shaped by various factors, including agricultural expansion, wood extraction, mining, infrastructure development, climate change, and socio-economic factors. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of these drivers and their impacts on the environment and local communities. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that accounts for both direct and underlying drivers and the unique context of each region. Effective management strategies must consider the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of these challenges. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving forest governance, empowering local communities, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders are crucial steps to protecting Peru’s natural resources. These measures can help balance economic development with environmental conservation, ensuring the sustainable use of land and resources. Equally important is addressing the underlying social and economic factors that drive land use change, including poverty, population growth, and migration. These factors often exacerbate environmental degradation and need to be integrated into broader development and conservation strategies.
A holistic approach that acknowledges the distinct challenges faced by the Amazon and Andean regions, can contribute to face deforestation as well as ensure the well-being of local communities, biodiversity conservation, and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change.

A Comprehensive Review of Land Use, Food Systems, and Socio-Economic Drivers The drivers of deforestation and land use change in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes are complex and interconnected, shaped by various factors, including agricultural expansion, wood extraction, mining, infrastructure development, climate change, and socio-economic factors. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of these drivers and their impacts on the environment and local communities. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that accounts for both direct and underlying drivers and the unique context of each region. Effective management strategies must consider the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of these challenges. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving forest governance, empowering local communities, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders are crucial steps to protecting Peru’s natural resources. These measures can help balance economic development with environmental conservation, ensuring the sustainable use of land and resources. Equally important is addressing the underlying social and economic factors that drive land use change, including poverty, population growth, and migration. These factors often exacerbate environmental degradation and need to be integrated into broader development and conservation strategies.
A holistic approach that acknowledges the distinct challenges faced by the Amazon and Andean regions, can contribute to face deforestation as well as ensure the well-being of local communities, biodiversity conservation, and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. Such an approach requires coordinated efforts from government, non-governmental organizations, local communities, and international partners to create effective and sustainable solutions.","1442"

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity. 

3. **Assign the score:** Based on the scoring criteria provided, assign the most appropriate score (0, 1, or 2). 

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

This Inclusive Landscape Management Plan (ILMP) seeks to provide a framework for the sustainable management and development of landscapes in the Ahafo Ano Southwest District (AASWD) of Ghana. The ILMP is designed to address the increasing pressure on landscapes in West and Central Africa under TAFS-WCA initiative (from deforestation, land degradation, poor water management, unsustainable mining, wildlife poaching, and climate change). The ILMP emphasizes the integration of social and ecological systems, local participation, and sustainable resource use and management within landscapes. It is a response to ‘top-down’ approaches to sustainable development, in which power and decision-making are in the hands of external development professionals. Instead, the ILMP is based on shared ownership of decision-making and the full participation of all stakeholders.
This ILMP is a product of a collaborative effort between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the AASWD, and local stakeholders from the Mankran micro-watershed of Ghana. The ILMP was developed through a participatory process that involved stakeholders from all sectors, including government, civil society, and the private sector. The process began with the creation of a narrative that served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management in the Mankran microwatershed. The research team then worked with local stakeholders to assess the current state of the landscape and identify key challenges and opportunities. Based on the assessment, the research team and stakeholders co-developed a set of management strategies and interventions that are designed to address the key challenges and achieve the desired outcomes. The ILMP was designed with a shared vision for the landscape: “To sustainably co-harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable manner to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano Southwest District. Based on the vision and identified challenges, stakeholders proposed various response strategies that included: Increased irrigation efficiency through adaptive and inclusive management; mechanisms to reduce postharvest losses; mechanism for profit or benefit sharing from mining and forestry; Enhanced gender and youth involvement in decision-making; Improved income and livelihood diversification opportunities; Improved adoption of sustainable land/forest/water management practices; Increased food safety through reduced contamination from pesticides and galamsey (illegal small-scale mining) the strengthening of local/traditional institutions for natural resources management. The ILMP also includes a monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress and ensure that the interventions are having the desired impact. It is critical to note that the ILMP is a living document that should be updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in the landscape and the needs of the stakeholders. It is hoped that the ILMP would serve as a blueprint for sustainable and inclusive landscape management in the AASWD and beyond.","1663"

This Inclusive Landscape Management Plan (ILMP) seeks to provide a framework for the sustainable management and development of landscapes in the Ahafo Ano Southwest District (AASWD) of Ghana. The ILMP is designed to address the increasing pressure on landscapes in West and Central Africa under TAFS-WCA initiative (from deforestation, land degradation, poor water management, unsustainable mining, wildlife poaching, and climate change). The ILMP emphasizes the integration of social and ecological systems, local participation, and sustainable resource use and management within landscapes. It is a response to ‘top-down’ approaches to sustainable development, in which power and decision-making are in the hands of external development professionals. Instead, the ILMP is based on shared ownership of decision-making and the full participation of all stakeholders.
This ILMP is a product of a collaborative effort between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the AASWD, and local stakeholders from the Mankran micro-watershed of Ghana. The ILMP was developed through a participatory process that involved stakeholders from all sectors, including government, civil society, and the private sector. The process began with the creation of a narrative that served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management in the Mankran microwatershed. The research team then worked with local stakeholders to assess the current state of the landscape and identify key challenges and opportunities. Based on the assessment, the research team and stakeholders co-developed a set of management strategies and interventions that are designed to address the key challenges and achieve the desired outcomes. The ILMP was designed with a shared vision for the landscape: “To sustainably co-harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable manner to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano Southwest District. Based on the vision and identified challenges, stakeholders proposed various response strategies that included: Increased irrigation efficiency through adaptive and inclusive management; mechanisms to reduce postharvest losses; mechanism for profit or benefit sharing from mining and forestry; Enhanced gender and youth involvement in decision-making; Improved income and livelihood diversification opportunities; Improved adoption of sustainable land/forest/water management practices; Increased food safety through reduced contamination from pesticides and galamsey (illegal small-scale mining) the strengthening of local/traditional institutions for natural resources management. The ILMP also includes a monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress and ensure that the interventions are having the desired impact. It is critical to note that the ILMP is a living document that should be updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in the landscape and the needs of the stakeholders.

### **Context:** 

CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research on food systems. 

 

### **Research Result Components:** 

Each research result includes the following details: 

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result.

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result.

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

Using nationally representative panel data collected in 2012 and 2016 and recent advances in the difference-indifferences literature, this paper explores the effects of the 2015/16 drought and the potential role of irrigation in reducing the adverse effects of the drought. We find that the drought caused, on average, a 37 percent reduction in net annual crop income, an 8 percent decline in area cultivated, a 3 percent decline in household dietary diversity score, and a 10 percent decline in the share of harvest sold for rainfed farmers. On the other hand, irrigating farmers affected by the drought managed to increase their daily expenditures by 72 percent of their average daily food expenditure in the pre-drought period, and maintained their net crop income, size of cultivated land, household dietary diversity, and share of harvest sold to the market. Overall, while rainfed agricultural producers suffered sharp declines in welfare, those farmers with access to irrigation maintained their economic status. The results suggest that irrigation protected farmers from the adverse effects of the 2015/16 ENSO event and given increasing climate variability in Ethiopia, the government should intensify its investment and support to irrigation development in the country.","1367"

Using nationally representative panel data collected in 2012 and 2016 and recent advances in the difference-indifferences literature, this paper explores the effects of the 2015/16 drought and the potential role of irrigation in reducing the adverse effects of the drought. We find that the drought caused, on average, a 37 percent reduction in net annual crop income, an 8 percent decline in area cultivated, a 3 percent decline in household dietary diversity score, and a 10 percent decline in the share of harvest sold for rainfed farmers. On the other hand, irrigating farmers affected by the drought managed to increase their daily expenditures by 72 percent of their average daily food expenditure in the pre-drought period, and maintained their net crop income, size of cultivated land, household dietary diversity, and share of harvest sold to the market. Overall, while rainfed agricultural producers suffered sharp declines in welfare, those farmers with access to irrigation maintained their economic status. The results suggest that irrigation protected farmers from the adverse effects of the 2015/16 ENSO event and given increasing climate variability in Ethiopia, the government should intensify its investment and support to irrigation development in the country.","1454"

### **Context:** 

CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research on food systems. 

 

### **Research Result Components:** 

Each research result includes the following details: 

- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result. 

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity. 

3. **Assign the score:** Based on the scoring criteria provided, assign the most appropriate score (0, 1, or 2). 

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity. 

3. **Assign the score:** Based on the scoring criteria provided, assign the most appropriate score (0, 1, or 2). 

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2.

[INPUT_TEXT]  **Text to Analyze:** [INPUT_TEXT]","o3-mini","Gender","How do sustainability policies emerge in the Colombian political system? A Kaleidoscope Model Analysis of the Policy for Sustainable Cattle 2022-2050 Environmental concerns such as deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions have reached preoccupying levels globally, for which the governments of different countries have committed to mitigation actions. In Colombia, one of the most ambitious initiatives to contribute to the commitments is the Policy for Sustainable Cattle 2022-2050 (Política para la Ganadería Bovina Sostenible 2022-2050), whose purpose is to promote the transition from traditional cattle farming to sustainable production systems and value chains. This study analyzes the construction process of the policy and determines the factors that allowed the change in public policies towards more sustainability. For this, a documentary analysis is carried out with a qualitative-descriptive approach consulting primary and secondary sources. As a theoretical framework, the Kaleidoscope Model of Policy Change is used, emphasizing on the first three stages, namely a) Agenda Setting, b) Design, and c) Adoption, and delving into the fourth stage of Implementation. The results reveal that multiple factors allowed the development of the policy, such as the need to face the environmental crisis, international summits that highlighted the problem, previous policies and, in general, an accumulation of experiences and knowledge. It became also evident that the main challenges for this policy have been the lack of coordination among the different national governments, as had its own vision of sustainability, in addition to the complexity of coordinating sustainability and competitiveness criteria among the ministries. It is concluded that although the development of the policy is a first step in the transition to sustainability, there are still many challenges ahead for change to be expressed in concrete actions.","1647"

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

However, the rapid increase in groundwater exploitation over the past four decades has resulted in depletion and degradation, particularly in regions already facing acute water scarcity, with potential irreversible impacts for food security and economic prosperity. Using a climate–water–food systems modelling framework, we develop exploratory scenarios and find that halting groundwater depletion without complementary policy actions would adversely affect food production and trade, increase food prices and grow the number of people at risk of hunger by 26 million by 2050. Supportive policy interventions in food and water systems such as increasing the effective use of precipitation and investments in agricultural research and development could mitigate most negative effects of sustainable groundwater use on food security. In addition, changing preferences of high-income countries towards less-meat-based diets would marginally alleviate pressures on food price. To safeguard the ability of groundwater systems to realize water and food security objectives amidst climate challenges, comprehensive measures encompassing improved water management practices, advancements in seed technologies and appropriate institutions will be needed.","1518"

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result. 

- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional). 

- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional). 

 

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Scoring Criteria:** 

Assign a score for the CGIAR Impact Area of Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion using the following criteria: 

 

- **0 = Not Targeted:**  

- The result does not directly contribute to any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion as it is outlined in the CGIAR 2030 Strategy. 

 

- **1 = Significant:** 

  - The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. However, contributing to the impact area is not one of the principal objectives of the result. 

 

- **2 = Principal:** 

- The result directly contributes to one or more aspects of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion. In addition, contributing to the impact area is one of the principal objectives of the result. 

- One or more aspects of the impact area is fundamental to the design of the activity leading to the result; the activity would not have been undertaken without this objective. 

 

### **Definition of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion:** 

- This Impact Area includes the following topics: Empowering women and youth; encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship; addressing socio-political barriers to social inclusion in food systems; ensuring equal access to resources; and meeting the specific crop and breed requirements and preferences of women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. 

- In addition, there are two global targets that CGIAR aims to contribute to through research activities in this Impact Area: 

1. To close the gender gap in rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and natural resources for women who work in food, land and water systems.  

2. To offer rewardable opportunities to young people who are not in employment, education or training. 

 

### **Instructions:** 

1. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text:** Assess whether any aspect of CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, as it is defined above in the list of topics and the global targets, is a direct objective or outcome of the result.  

2. **Analyze the title, description, abstract and parsed text again:** Assess whether or not the objectives and/or outcomes related to CGIAR’s Impact Area on Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion, if there are any, were the principle reason, or one of the principle reasons, for undertaking the research or activity.

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

The presentation explored the (perceived) quality of inputs and technologies and their influence on adoption by smallholders. The study randomly introduced an information clearinghouse (similar to yelp.com) to test whether information asymmetries crowd out quality products. Findings show that the clearinghouse treatment improves outcomes for farmers and agro-dealers, with agro-dealers receiving more customers and reporting higher revenues from seed sales, and farmers reporting higher use of quality seed obtained from agro-dealers. The primary mechanisms behind this impact appear to be increased competition on quality, which is manifested in agro-dealers' increased service provision and efforts to signal quality, resulting in greater trust in the seed market.","1264"

4. **Provide a brief justification:** Explain why you assigned this score, referencing specific aspects of the result that influenced your decision and how they align (or do not align) with the scoring criteria and definition of the impact area. 

 

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.

### **Important Notes:** 

If the score is based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, note the following: 

- Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals regardless of their gender. In the context of agriculture, gender equality addresses the disparities and biases that may exist in access to resources, decision-making, and benefits among individuals of different genders. Gender in the context of social sciences is not defined by biological differences between male and female crops or animals. Thus discussion of male and female crops or animals in a result is not sufficient by itself for a score of 1 or 2. Gender-disaggregated data or mention of the number of male and female participants in the research by itself is also not sufficient for a score of 1 or 2. Qualitative aspects such as roles, responsibilities, decision-making influence, and resource distribution need to be considered in the result for a score of 1 or 2. 

- To merit a score of 0 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result does not reveal any insights into gender-related implications or impacts and does not provide information for understanding gender dynamics in a social (not physiological) context. 

- To merit a score of 1 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, a result needs to reveal insights into gender-related implications or impacts and provide valuable information for understanding gender dynamics in agriculture (e.g., social roles, power dynamics, access to resources, and decision-making) or have potential implications for gender-inclusive policies and practices. 

- To merit a score of 2 based on contributions to aspects of the Impact Area related to gender equality, the research or activity must have a clear goal/focus on contributing to understanding gender-related issues in agriculture, such as gender-based access to resources, decision-making, labor division, or women’s empowerment.
