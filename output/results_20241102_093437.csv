The research contributes to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction and livelihoods by improving the productivity and profitability of bean farming—a significant source of income for over 200 million Africans—but these are indirect benefits rather than the main goal. Therefore, the research makes a meaningful contribution to poverty reduction and livelihoods, aligning with a tag of 1 (Significant) as per the criteria."
