In collaboration with national yam breeding programs in Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana and Benin, IITA yam breeding seeks to develop and deploy end-user preferred White Yam and Water Yam varieties with higher yield, greater resistance to pests and diseases and improved quality, targeted at West Africa. Together these collaborators seek to address common yam breeding challenges: reducing lengthy crop cycles to 3-4 years, poor seed multiplication ratio, poor understanding of genetic diversity, limited breeding enabling technologies, and limited current capacity in West Africa. In 2023, significant strides were made in enhancing the efficiency of breeding programs, including defining the yam market segmentation, refining the yam product profile, deploying marker assisted selection, and use of quantitative genetics methods to optimize breeding approaches. Yam consumers participated in elite clone selection. Two white varieties and one water yam variety were released in collaboration with the National Root Crops Research Institute in Nigeria.","225"

The CIMMYT Global Wheat Program is one of the most important public sources of high yielding, nutritious, disease- and climate-resilient wheat varieties for Africa, Asia, and Latin America; its lines are found in varieties sown on more than 60 million hectares worldwide. The program works with ICARDA and more than 200 local research and breeding institutions, sharing climate-resilient, Zinc-biofortified, high- yielding, disease and pest tolerant wheat lines and data. National partners are active participants in breeding, many of them managing precise phenotyping platforms or using the lines for local breeding efforts. Molecular breeding tools, bioinformatics and speed breeding have resulted in a cycle time of 3 years in spring wheat. During 2023, partners in Bangladesh, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Spain and Türkiye registered 55 varieties for use, including 45 selected for climate resilience, and 20 varieties biofortified for Zinc.","246"

Ethiopia releases a dryland variety. As demand for wheat grows rapidly across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, ICARDA is addressing the growing climatic challenges, pests, and diseases that hinder its domestic production by generating an effective wheat-breeding strategy. The resulting wheat varieties deliver high yield potential, resistance/tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and acceptable end-use qualities. ICARDA's bread wheat breeding program develops new candidate varieties in collaboration with public and private sector partners and farmers, through two breeding pipelines targeted at 1. Rainfed spring bread wheat for Central and West Asia, and North, Eastern, Southern and West Africa dry lands, and 2. Heat tolerant spring bread wheat for Eastern, Southern, West and North Africa, and Central and West Asia regions. The current breeding cycle time is 4 years. Ethiopia releases one dryland variety for use by farmers.","229"

They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.","233"
