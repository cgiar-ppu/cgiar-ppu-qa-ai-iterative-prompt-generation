They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.","233"

It aims to understand and analyze the seed production, availability, and quality, as well as the co-existence of formal and informal seed systems with a focus on pulses seeds. The study was conducted in 13 districts of Odisha, representing 10 Agro Climatic Zones covering 13 Farmer Producer Organizations, 40 Producer Groups and 210 farmers. It captured the variations in agricultural practices and seed systems across the state to identify region-specific challenges and opportunities. The primary data was collected through interviews and focus group discussions with farmers, PGs, FPOs, VSHs, scientists of ICAR Institutes, CGIAR Institutes, OUAT, departmental officials and private seed company.","187"
