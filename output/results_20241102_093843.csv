Common beans are noted as a significant source of income for over 200 million Africans, indicating that the improved varieties can contribute to poverty reduction and livelihood improvement. However, the primary objective of the research is the advancement of bean breeding and genetic gains, not directly targeting poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation as main goals. These objectives are important considerations but are secondary to the research's focus on agricultural innovation. Therefore, the research is significant (score of 1) in contributing to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, and jobs.""
