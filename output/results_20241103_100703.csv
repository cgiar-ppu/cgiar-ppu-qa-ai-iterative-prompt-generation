1020,Test_V1,gpt-4o-mini,Gender,"The result discusses the Aclimatar initiative, which focuses on climate change adaptation for smallholder cocoa producers in West Africa, particularly in Ghana and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. It emphasizes the use of site-specific climate risk assessments and tailored adaptation practices to enhance resilience against climate impacts in cocoa farming.

This initiative aims to empower local farmers by providing essential climate data and adaptation strategies, thereby promoting sustainable agricultural practices in the face of climate variability.",954,2024-11-03 10:07:04.982899,,
1006,Test_V1,gpt-4o-mini,Gender,"The result is about the Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI), which measures women's empowerment in livestock-related livelihoods. 

WELI helps assess how livestock interventions impact women's empowerment, aiming to improve these interventions for better opportunities, enhance household livelihoods, and promote gender equity. It was developed by ILRI and Emory University in 2015, building on the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI).",214,2024-11-03 10:07:04.995939,,
37,Test_V1,gpt-4o-mini,Gender,"The result discusses the development and testing of improved bean varieties in Africa, focusing on drought and heat resilience, as well as biofortification. It highlights collaboration among various organizations to enhance genetic gains in common beans, which are vital for food security and income for millions.

This analysis emphasizes the systematic approach to breeding pipelines, market needs, and the impact of these efforts on agricultural productivity and farmer livelihoods.",1127,2024-11-03 10:07:05.001946,,
