4771,TEST_Without,o1-mini,None,"### **Summary and Analysis of ""Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of Agripreneurs and Linked Households for Testing Delivery of Bundled Technology Packages in Tanzania""**

#### **Overview**
The document is a research brief (ILRI Research Brief 112) dated June 2022, authored by James Rao, Immaculate Omondi, Jane Poole, and Amos Omore from the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). It outlines the methodology and results of selecting agripreneurs (APs) and linked households (HHs) for testing bundled technology packages aimed at strengthening agribusinesses in Tanzania.

#### **Key Objectives**
- **Strengthening Agribusinesses:** Enhance the capacity of agribusinesses through agri-preneur incubation packages that emphasize gender responsiveness, bundled inputs/services, and the utilization of a ""one network ecosystem.""
- **Improving Value Chains:** Strengthen the linkages within value chains to connect farmers with product buyers and suppliers of productivity-enhancing technologies, inputs, and services.
- **Private Sector Growth:** Address the current limitations hindering private sector growth in Tanzania's key commodity value chains, such as lack of knowledge and coordination among actors.

#### **Methodology**
The selection process comprised three main stages:

1. **Scoping (Stage 1):**
   - **Data Collection:** Conducted between October and November 2020 across six districts (Hai, Siha, Korogwe, Muheza, Moshi Rural, Rombo) in Kilimanjaro and Tanga regions.
   - **Sampling Technique:** Employed key informant interviews and snowball sampling to generate a comprehensive list of 427 APs, out of which 291 were interviewed using a structured survey tool to gather data on business type, gender, area of operation, products/services offered, and training needs.

2. **Selection of Agripreneurs (Stage 2):**
   - **Scoring Criteria:** APs were scored based on business type, linkages with producer organizations (POs), scale of operation, gender, and age.
   - **Score Distribution:** Scores ranged from -4 to +5, with higher scores indicating more advanced business operations.
   - **Target Selection:** Approximately 50 APs were targeted for the incubation program, ensuring diversity in business levels, and representation of women and youth.

3. **Selection of Households (Stage 3):**
   - **Household Identification:** Compiled a list of dairy households (both cooperative and non-cooperative) within selected wards.
   - **Sampling:** Surveyed 713 households across 24 wards (12 intervention and 12 control) to represent the target population.

#### **Results**
- **Agripreneur Selection:**
  - **Intervention vs. Control:** Out of 193 APs in intervention districts, 60 were selected for incubation.
  - **Gender and Youth Representation:** Ensured a balanced representation of women (34%) and youth (48%) among selected APs.
  - **Business Levels:** Included APs across various business scales to maintain diversity and avoid bias.

- **Household Survey:**
  - **Distribution:** 713 households surveyed, with a balanced distribution across intervention and control wards.
  - **Linkages:** Focused on households linked to selected APs through POs/cooperatives.

#### **Discussion and Next Steps**
- **Complexity of Social Experiments:** Acknowledges the complexity of isolating the effects of Business Development Services (BDS) versus technology packages due to varying intervention uptake among APs.
- **Data Analysis:** Plans to use baseline and endline surveys to measure changes in input and service usage. Emphasizes the need to account for different intervention combinations and potential confounding factors.
- **Qualitative and Quantitative Assessment:** Incorporates both qualitative (Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice analysis) and quantitative methods to evaluate behavioral changes among APs and households.

#### **Strengths**
- **Comprehensive Selection Process:** Utilizes a structured, multi-stage approach to ensure diverse and representative selection of APs and households.
- **Gender and Youth Focus:** Actively incorporates gender responsiveness and youth participation, promoting inclusivity.
- **Integrated Methodology:** Combines qualitative and quantitative methods for robust data collection and analysis.

#### **Weaknesses**
- **Potential Biases:** Despite efforts to avoid deliberate bias, the selection process may still be influenced by the preferences of the Livestock CRP flagships.
- **Complex Analysis Requirements:** The multifaceted nature of interventions may complicate the ability to isolate specific impacts of BDS versus technology packages.

#### **Implications**
- **Policy and Program Design:** Insights from this study can inform the design of future agribusiness incubation programs, emphasizing the importance of coordinated interventions and inclusive participation.
- **Private Sector Engagement:** Highlights the critical role of private sector actors in strengthening value chains and improving livelihoods in Tanzania's agribusiness sector.

#### **Conclusion**
The ""Maziwa Zaidi"" project represents a significant effort to bolster agribusinesses in Tanzania through targeted incubation of agripreneurs and the delivery of bundled technology packages. By addressing key limitations in the private sector and fostering strong linkages within value chains, the project aims to enhance productivity, income, and food security for smallholder farmers. The comprehensive selection and analysis methodology sets a strong foundation for evaluating the program's effectiveness and scalability.
