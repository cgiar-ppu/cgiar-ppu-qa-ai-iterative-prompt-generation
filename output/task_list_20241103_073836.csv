"37","NUTRITION_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, and food security. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has set specific objectives to address global challenges in nutrition, health, and food security, aiming to improve the well-being of populations in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a nutrition, health, and food security impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for nutrition, health, or food security.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering its impact on nutrition or food security.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on food availability, indirectly supporting food security.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing malnutrition in rural communities by improving access to nutritious foods.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Ending Hunger:** Enabling affordable, healthy diets for the 3 billion people who do not currently have access to safe and nutritious food.
- **Reducing Illness:** Decreasing cases of foodborne illness (600 million annually) and zoonotic diseases (1 billion annually) by one-third.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “malnutrition,” “food security,” or “public health.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, and food security.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If nutrition, health, or food security are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that nutrition, health, or food security objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a nutrition, health, and food security tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o","Nutrition","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

"37","NUTRITION_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, and food security. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has set specific objectives to address global challenges in nutrition, health, and food security, aiming to improve the well-being of populations in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a nutrition, health, and food security impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for nutrition, health, or food security.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering its impact on nutrition or food security.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on food availability, indirectly supporting food security.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing malnutrition in rural communities by improving access to nutritious foods.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Ending Hunger:** Enabling affordable, healthy diets for the 3 billion people who do not currently have access to safe and nutritious food.
- **Reducing Illness:** Decreasing cases of foodborne illness (600 million annually) and zoonotic diseases (1 billion annually) by one-third.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “malnutrition,” “food security,” or “public health.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, and food security.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If nutrition, health, or food security are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that nutrition, health, or food security objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a nutrition, health, and food security tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Nutrition","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

"37","POVERTY_REDUCTION_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, and job creation. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has set specific objectives to address global challenges, including poverty reduction, improving livelihoods, and job creation in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a poverty reduction, livelihoods, and jobs impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for poverty or livelihoods.
  - Example: A study focused solely on agricultural productivity without considering its impact on poverty, livelihoods, or job creation.

- **1 = Significant:** 
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on income generation, indirectly supporting poverty reduction and improving livelihoods.

- **2 = Principal:** 
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation.
  - The research would not have been conducted without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for improving rural livelihoods and lifting communities out of extreme poverty.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Poverty Alleviation:** Lifting at least 500 million people living in rural areas above the extreme poverty line of US $1.90 per day (2011 PPP).
- **Reducing Poverty:** Reducing by at least half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions, according to national definitions.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “income generation,” “employment,” or “poverty alleviation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, and job creation.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that these objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a poverty reduction, livelihoods, and jobs tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o","Poverty","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

"37","POVERTY_REDUCTION_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, and job creation. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has set specific objectives to address global challenges, including poverty reduction, improving livelihoods, and job creation in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a poverty reduction, livelihoods, and jobs impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for poverty or livelihoods.
  - Example: A study focused solely on agricultural productivity without considering its impact on poverty, livelihoods, or job creation.

- **1 = Significant:** 
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on income generation, indirectly supporting poverty reduction and improving livelihoods.

- **2 = Principal:** 
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation.
  - The research would not have been conducted without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for improving rural livelihoods and lifting communities out of extreme poverty.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Poverty Alleviation:** Lifting at least 500 million people living in rural areas above the extreme poverty line of US $1.90 per day (2011 PPP).
- **Reducing Poverty:** Reducing by at least half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions, according to national definitions.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “income generation,” “employment,” or “poverty alleviation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, and job creation.

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Poverty","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.
