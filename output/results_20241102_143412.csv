While the primary objective is to improve disease resistance in sweet potato varieties, this contributes significantly to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction and improving livelihoods. Sweet potato is a staple crop in regions like East Africa, where SPVD severely affects production. By enabling the development of SPVD-resistant varieties with higher yields (e.g., two clones exhibiting yields of 28.7-34.9 t ha⁻¹), the research indirectly supports poverty alleviation and better livelihoods for smallholder farmers dependent on sweet potato cultivation. Therefore, the research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR's goals in these areas, but poverty reduction and livelihoods are not the primary focus, warranting a tag of 1 (Significant).""
