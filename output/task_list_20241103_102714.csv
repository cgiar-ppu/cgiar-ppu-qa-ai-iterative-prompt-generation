"37","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","The Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index(WELI) for measuring women's empowerment in systems where livestock is important for livelihood The WELI facilitates assessments of the impact of livestock interventions on the empowerment of women involved in the sector. By getting better at understanding what interventions work best at providing empowering opportunities, we can refine these interventions and in the long term, provide better empowering opportunities for women involved in livestock. Providing women farmers with opportunities for empowerment through livestock is important to both enhance household livelihoods and nutrition while also promoting progress on gender equity. In 2015, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), in collaboration with Emory University developed the WELI tool based on the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) developed earlier by IFPRI. The WELI measures women’s empowerment in livestock and crop agriculture and focuses specifically on key areas of livestock production, such as animal health, breeding and feeding; and on use of livestock products, such as animal-source-food processing and marketing.

The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT has extensive experience in using seasonal climate forecasts to improve the management of annual crops (e.g., variety selection, planting time, etc.), but there is limited experience with perennial cropping systems such as cocoa. To this end, we aim to understand which management decisions can benefit from seasonal climate forecasts, which climate variables would require good forecasting skills, and how forecasts need to be translated and communicated to end- users. To achieve this goal, the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT is applying human-centered design (HCD), a creative and participatory approach to problem-solving that allows for a deep understanding of the people for whom we design and the environments in which they live. Stakeholders are considered co-designers in the process of creating solutions or tools, whether digital or non-digital.
