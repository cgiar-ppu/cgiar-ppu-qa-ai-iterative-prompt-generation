"7","POVERTY_REDUCTION_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, and job creation. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has set specific objectives to address global challenges, including poverty reduction, improving livelihoods, and job creation in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a poverty reduction, livelihoods, and jobs impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for poverty or livelihoods.
  - Example: A study focused solely on agricultural productivity without considering its impact on poverty, livelihoods, or job creation.

- **1 = Significant:** 
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on income generation, indirectly supporting poverty reduction and improving livelihoods.

- **2 = Principal:** 
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation.
  - The research would not have been conducted without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for improving rural livelihoods and lifting communities out of extreme poverty.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Poverty Alleviation:** Lifting at least 500 million people living in rural areas above the extreme poverty line of US $1.90 per day (2011 PPP).
- **Reducing Poverty:** Reducing by at least half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions, according to national definitions.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “income generation,” “employment,” or “poverty alleviation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, and job creation.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that these objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a poverty reduction, livelihoods, and jobs tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

"8","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

"10","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has set specific objectives to address global challenges, including poverty reduction, improving livelihoods, and job creation in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a poverty reduction, livelihoods, and jobs impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for poverty or livelihoods.
  - Example: A study focused solely on agricultural productivity without considering its impact on poverty, livelihoods, or job creation.

- **1 = Significant:** 
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on income generation, indirectly supporting poverty reduction and improving livelihoods.

- **2 = Principal:** 
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation.
  - The research would not have been conducted without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for improving rural livelihoods and lifting communities out of extreme poverty.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Poverty Alleviation:** Lifting at least 500 million people living in rural areas above the extreme poverty line of US $1.90 per day (2011 PPP).
- **Reducing Poverty:** Reducing by at least half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions, according to national definitions.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, or job creation by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “income generation,” “employment,” or “poverty alleviation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in poverty reduction, livelihoods, and job creation.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**

"11","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

"12","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Poverty","Yam breeding network in Africa addresses breeding challenges to develop consumer-demanded, more productive, pest and disease resistant White and Water Yam varieties; Nigeria releases three Yam varieties. In collaboration with national yam breeding programs in Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana and Benin, IITA yam breeding seeks to develop and deploy end-user preferred White Yam and Water Yam varieties with higher yield, greater resistance to pests and diseases and improved quality, targeted at West Africa. Together these collaborators seek to address common yam breeding challenges: reducing lengthy crop cycles to 3-4 years, poor seed multiplication ratio, poor understanding of genetic diversity, limited breeding enabling technologies, and limited current capacity in West Africa. In 2023, significant strides were made in enhancing the efficiency of breeding programs, including defining the yam market segmentation, refining the yam product profile, deploying marker assisted selection, and use of quantitative genetics methods to optimize breeding approaches. Yam consumers participated in elite clone selection. Two white varieties and one water yam variety were released in collaboration with the National Root Crops Research Institute in Nigeria.  Yam breeding pipelines: 2023 Report
The West Africa Yam breeding network has made significant strides in enhancing the efficiency of its breeding program. Several approaches were used among which defining the yam market segmentation, refining the yam product profile, deployment of marker assisted selection, used of quantitative genetics methods, etc.

To ensure the successful implementation of market segmentation strategies, we conducted training to the national partners. The first comprehensive training took place in May 2023 at the IITA campus in Ibadan, involving all West Africa Yam network partners. The second round of training occurred between July and August as part of the ABI-TRANSFORM initiative. This phase, conducted alongside the yam network coordinator, coincided with the breeding program assessments for each partner, further reinforcing the practical application of market segmentation principles. Details information has been submitted under the 2023 network coordination report. We have summarized the in the table 2 the yam product profile and different traits related.
The yam breeding program at IITA has three well defined breeding pipelines i.e. early white yam, intermediate white guinea yam and water yam. Based on the market demand, consumer preference demand each breeding pipeline is at a different stage of modernization. We presented here the update research work conducted during 2023 cropping season to optimize the yam breeding cycle.

Deployment of marker assisted selection in the breeding program. 
In 2023, we have selected 3008 genotypes from early generation and applied KAPS markers associated with seven traits of importance. We identified favorable alleles and unfavorable variants responsible for predicting higher yield and low virus severity scores in the breeding panel through the marker-effect prediction. We also validated marker related to plant sex, flowering intensity, plant vigor and tuber appearance. The markers can be applied in both intermediate and early white guinea yam. 
Development of Middle density SNP markers
The breeding program has successfully converted 2500 markers. These markers are to be tested and to be used for genomic selection/prediction as well as for genomic prediction of cross performance.
Identification of markers associated to tuber quality. 
Yam tuber quality is one of the major traits driven yam adoption in West Africa. However, tuber quality evaluation is only evaluated at late trials. We then conducted trait-association to uncover genomic region controlling the tuber quality. We assembled 5 mapping population to assess the genetic architecture of tuber boiled, pounded and instrumental. Table 3 summarized the different traits evaluated for the boiled and for the pounded.

An Index was generated for the boiled as well as for the pounded and several genomic region associated with the traits were identified. A published manuscript with full detail information can be accessed through the following link https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.12816 
Reference genome. 
With the help of Crops to End Huger (CtEH), the yam breeding has developed 4 additional reference genomes using HIFIseq. The reference genome has been assembled into reference file. Additional analysis is ongoing to elucidate the different gene through annotation and gene prediction model. In addition to this, 2 genotypes have sequenced using PACBIO long read with Cornell. 
Development of breeding costing 
The yam breeding at IITA was among the first breeding program and through the breeding modernization project, to develop the full cost of running the breeding program. Using the Queensland Costing tool, the total cost (Fixed and direct) was developed in collaboration with the ABI-TransForm team. Across all the location and for all the three yam projects, the annual cost of running the IITA yam breeding program is estimated to be 2.7 million USD. Among the three yam breeding project, the highest cost is water yam ($970,359.00) followed by the intermediate white yam ($918,427.71) and early white yam ($857,567.53). 
Estimation of Genetic gain 
In 2023, the yam breeding program alongside with the Biometrician unit assembled 11-year data and used for genetic gain estimation. To estimate the genetic gain, we made use of historical data (2010 to 2022) from of past breeding program. We focus on two pipelines (the early and intermediate) of the white yam. We observed positive genetic trends in fresh tuber yield while recording a gain of 1.4% or 97.9 kg ha-1 per year in the white Guinea yam and 1.75 % or 211 kg ha-1 per year in the water yam breeding pipeline. Genetic trends for virus and anthracnose resistance were negligible in white Guinea yam but were in desired direction in water yam. We discovered that that while the breeding program has succeeded in enhancing tuber yield, post-harvest tuber dry matter content, and disease resistance (yam mosaic virus and anthracnose) did not follow a similar trend in the materials been developed.
Yam product advancement 
A total 20 trials were established in 2022 across several locations covering several stage gate (Table 4). Based on the breeding objective several analyses were conducted depending on the breeding stage gate. The best clones were advanced and evaluated during 2023 cropping season.

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Yam breeding network in Africa addresses breeding challenges to develop consumer-demanded, more productive, pest and disease resistant White and Water Yam varieties; Nigeria releases three Yam varieties. In collaboration with national yam breeding programs in Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana and Benin, IITA yam breeding seeks to develop and deploy end-user preferred White Yam and Water Yam varieties with higher yield, greater resistance to pests and diseases and improved quality, targeted at West Africa. Together these collaborators seek to address common yam breeding challenges: reducing lengthy crop cycles to 3-4 years, poor seed multiplication ratio, poor understanding of genetic diversity, limited breeding enabling technologies, and limited current capacity in West Africa. In 2023, significant strides were made in enhancing the efficiency of breeding programs, including defining the yam market segmentation, refining the yam product profile, deploying marker assisted selection, and use of quantitative genetics methods to optimize breeding approaches. Yam consumers participated in elite clone selection. Two white varieties and one water yam variety were released in collaboration with the National Root Crops Research Institute in Nigeria.  Yam breeding pipelines: 2023 Report
The West Africa Yam breeding network has made significant strides in enhancing the efficiency of its breeding program. Several approaches were used among which defining the yam market segmentation, refining the yam product profile, deployment of marker assisted selection, used of quantitative genetics methods, etc.
Yam breeding stage Breeding stages gate
The yam breeding has optimized his breeding pipeline stage gate. The breeding stage gate include stage 0, 1 and 2 under the discovery work package. Stage 3 to stage 7 are under the accelerating and the yam breeding has adopted several initiatives to improve and optimize the research activities across his hub and his NARS. In table 1, we have summarized the yam breeding stage gate, description as well as the definition under the yam breeding program.

Market Segmentation and product profile in West Africa:
In 2023, the yam breeding program refined his market segment across the West Africa and extended to Central and to the East Africa. 
The yam market segments identified in Cote d'Ivoire:
White yam early,
White yam intermediate/late
Water yam with D. alata.
The yam market segments identified in Benin,
White yam early Intermediate bulking for domestic use,
White Yam Late Bulking with multiple and small tuber for domestic use. This is generally call kokoro and used for “amala”
Water yam or D. alata.
The yam market segments identified in Ghana’s.
Intermediate or late maturity white yam
Early maturity Semi-Dwarf white yam
Greater yam (Water yam)
The yam market segments identified in Nigeria
Intermediate or Late maturity white yam,
Early Maturity Semi-Dwarf white yam with less climbing attitude
Greater yam (Water yam)
To ensure the successful implementation of market segmentation strategies, we conducted training to the national partners. The first comprehensive training took place in May 2023 at the IITA campus in Ibadan, involving all West Africa Yam network partners. The second round of training occurred between July and August as part of the ABI-TRANSFORM initiative. This phase, conducted alongside the yam network coordinator, coincided with the breeding program assessments for each partner, further reinforcing the practical application of market segmentation principles. Details information has been submitted under the 2023 network coordination report. We have summarized the in the table 2 the yam product profile and different traits related.
The yam breeding program at IITA has three well defined breeding pipelines i.e. early white yam, intermediate white guinea yam and water yam. Based on the market demand, consumer preference demand each breeding pipeline is at a different stage of modernization. We presented here the update research work conducted during 2023 cropping season to optimize the yam breeding cycle.

Deployment of marker assisted selection in the breeding program. 
In 2023, we have selected 3008 genotypes from early generation and applied KAPS markers associated with seven traits of importance. We identified favorable alleles and unfavorable variants responsible for predicting higher yield and low virus severity scores in the breeding panel through the marker-effect prediction. We also validated marker related to plant sex, flowering intensity, plant vigor and tuber appearance. The markers can be applied in both intermediate and early white guinea yam. 
Development of Middle density SNP markers
The breeding program has successfully converted 2500 markers. These markers are to be tested and to be used for genomic selection/prediction as well as for genomic prediction of cross performance.
Identification of markers associated to tuber quality. 
Yam tuber quality is one of the major traits driven yam adoption in West Africa. However, tuber quality evaluation is only evaluated at late trials. We then conducted trait-association to uncover genomic region controlling the tuber quality. We assembled 5 mapping population to assess the genetic architecture of tuber boiled, pounded and instrumental. Table 3 summarized the different traits evaluated for the boiled and for the pounded.

An Index was generated for the boiled as well as for the pounded and several genomic region associated with the traits were identified. A published manuscript with full detail information can be accessed through the following link https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.12816 
Reference genome. 
With the help of Crops to End Huger (CtEH), the yam breeding has developed 4 additional reference genomes using HIFIseq. The reference genome has been assembled into reference file. Additional analysis is ongoing to elucidate the different gene through annotation and gene prediction model. In addition to this, 2 genotypes have sequenced using PACBIO long read with Cornell. 
Development of breeding costing 
The yam breeding at IITA was among the first breeding program and through the breeding modernization project, to develop the full cost of running the breeding program. Using the Queensland Costing tool, the total cost (Fixed and direct) was developed in collaboration with the ABI-TransForm team. Across all the location and for all the three yam projects, the annual cost of running the IITA yam breeding program is estimated to be 2.7 million USD. Among the three yam breeding project, the highest cost is water yam ($970,359.00) followed by the intermediate white yam ($918,427.71) and early white yam ($857,567.53).

In 2023, the yam breeding program alongside with the Biometrician unit assembled 11-year data and used for genetic gain estimation. To estimate the genetic gain, we made use of historical data (2010 to 2022) from of past breeding program. We focus on two pipelines (the early and intermediate) of the white yam. We observed positive genetic trends in fresh tuber yield while recording a gain of 1.4% or 97.9 kg ha-1 per year in the white Guinea yam and 1.75 % or 211 kg ha-1 per year in the water yam breeding pipeline. Genetic trends for virus and anthracnose resistance were negligible in white Guinea yam but were in desired direction in water yam. We discovered that that while the breeding program has succeeded in enhancing tuber yield, post-harvest tuber dry matter content, and disease resistance (yam mosaic virus and anthracnose) did not follow a similar trend in the materials been developed.
Yam product advancement 
A total 20 trials were established in 2022 across several locations covering several stage gate (Table 4). Based on the breeding objective several analyses were conducted depending on the breeding stage gate. The best clones were advanced and evaluated during 2023 cropping season.

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Poverty","The comparative performance of land sharing, land sparing type interventions on place-based human well-being Environment-facing interventions impact the distribution, use of and access of natural resources and have important implications for all dimensions (material, relational, quality of life) of human well-being (HWB). Yet conventional impact metrics routinely surpass the non-material impacts which may be particularly salient in rural contexts where small-scale farmers depend directly on the land and biodiversity. Furthermore, little is known about the comparative performance of distinct interventions along a land-sharing, versus land sparing gradient, on local definitions of HWB.
We address this knowledge gap, adopting a perception-based impact evaluation within communities across four intervention types representing the land sparing, sharing gradient: intensified industrial soy production (n = 60 HHs), a protected area (n = 70), an extractive reserve (n = 70) and a national forest (n = 70) in Pará in the Brazilian Amazon. We collected data using the Global Person Generated Index (GPGI) with household heads (n = 270) in eight communities (two per intervention type). Focus group discussions (n = 8) solicited residents' perceptions of impact pathways.
Our findings highlight the important contribution of relational and subjective dimensions to HWB and call in to question the dominance of material measures in standard impact appraisals.
Furthermore, we show that single sector and integrated approaches generate ‘polarized impact footprints’ in which integrated approaches achieve (a) more impact, which is (b) more often positive and (c) locally salient, the inverse is true for single-sector sparing style approaches.

1. Environment-  facing interventions impact the distribution, use of and access of 
natural resources and have important implications for all dimensions (material, 
relational, quality of life) of human well- being (HWB). Yet conventional impact 
metrics routinely surpass the non- material impacts which may be particularly sali -
ent in rural contexts where small-  scale farmers depend directly on the land and 
biodiversity. Furthermore, little is known about the comparative performance of 
distinct interventions along a land-  sharing, versus land sparing gradient, on local 
definitions of HWB.
2. We address this knowledge gap, adopting a perception- based impact evalua -
tion within communities across four intervention types representing the land 
sparing, sharing gradient: intensified industrial soy production ( n = 60 HHs), a 
protected area ( n = 70), an extractive reserve ( n = 70) and a national forest ( n = 
70) in Pará in the Brazilian Amazon. We collected data using the Global Person 
Generated Index (GPGI) with household heads ( n = 270) in eight communities 
(two per intervention type). Focus group discussions ( n = 8) solicited residents' 
perceptions of impact pathways.
3. Our findings highlight the important contribution of relational and subjective 
dimensions to HWB and call in to question the dominance of material measures 
in standard impact appraisals.
4. Furthermore, we show that single sector and integrated approaches generate 
‘polarized impact footprints’ in which integrated approaches achieve (a) more 
impact, which is (b) more often positive and (c) locally salient, the inverse is true 
for single-  sector sparing style approaches.
5. Areas of well- being that matter locally (culture, health and social relations), but 
are not impacted by interventions are relational, and point towards the potential 
of rights- based conservation to empower rural smallholders to remain in their 
communities while flourishing.

CARMENTA ET Al.
1 | INTRODUCTION
In recent years the international policy arena has shown deeper rec -
ognition of the relationship between the environment and human 
well-  being (hereafter HWB). The Intergovernmental Science-  Policy 
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) endeavour 
is documenting the diversity of relationships, including those non-  
instrumental relationships, between people and the natural world 
(Chan et al., 2016 ; Pascual et al., 2017 , 2021 ), the planetary health 
community underscores the interlinkage between environmental 
and human health (Whitmee et al., 2015 ) and the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals emphasise the interdependent nature of de -
velopment and environmental integrity (Schleicher, Schaafsma, & 
Vira, 2018 ). Indeed, the earlier formulation of the ecosystem ser -
vices (ES) concept identified a typology of services on which human -
ity and HWB depend (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,  2005 ). 
However, subsequent application of the ES framework has tended 
towards the dichotomy of instrumental and intrinsic values of na -
ture, overshadowing those non-  instrumental flows between nature 
and the multiple dimensions of HWB (Himes & Muraca, 2018 ; Russell 
et al., 2013 ). In addition, recent advances have helped to recognise, 
quantify and understand the disproportionate contribution of con -
sumption and wealth to environmental collapse (Lenzen et al., 2012 ; 
Otero et al., 2020 ). Yet, despite this progress on the one hand of 
determining the interconnected nature of natural systems and the 
multiple dimensions of HWB, and the disproportionate role of (often 
geographically distant) wealth accumulation in biodiversity decline 
on the other, the geographic focus of many conservation interven -
tions remains centred on site-  level interventions in tropical forest 
landscapes working with the rural poor (McKinnon et al., 2016 ; Reed 
et al., 2020 ; Roe & Elliott, 2004 ). These interventions often attempt 
to achieve a combination of climate, conservation and development 
wins (Miller,  2014 ; Reed et al., 2020 ), which are pursued through dis -
tinct interventions ranging from protected areas (PAs) or agricultural 
intensification, to integrated landscape approaches.
The design of interventions depends on how the relationship 
between development and the environment is framed and under -
stood (Adams et al., 2004 ; Otero et al., 2020 ). Single-  sector inter -
ventions (e.g. those that promote agricultural intensification or PAs) 
stem from a fundamental separation of people and nature (Adams 
et al., 2004 ). PAs, a traditional model of conservation supported 
by influential conservation scientists (e.g. E. O. Wilson), may afford 
biodiversity gains but can result in injustices for residents, includ -
ing eviction from intergenerational homelands (Cundill et al., 2017 ; 
Rai et al., 2019 ), and lost access to resources necessary for liveli -
hoods and livelihood resilience (Agarwala et al., 2014 ; Shepherd et al., 2020 ; West et al., 2006 ). Agricultural intensification is often 
supported by governments (e.g. through subsidies and incen -
tive schemes) concerned with development and growth (Dawson 
et al., 2016 ), and by some conservation scientists who contend that 
intensification (increased output per unit area of crop-  land) can 
spare land for nature (recognised as ‘land sparing’ approaches; Green 
et al., 2005 ). However, intensification also generates social and en -
vironmental burdens that include infringements on HWB particu -
larly for small-  scale land managers peripheral to market economies 
(Dawson et al., 2016 ; Rasmussen et al., 2018 ; Santika et al., 2020 ). 
Furthermore, intensification is associated with land accumulation 
by an elite few in tandem with the disenfranchisement of a larger 
un- capitalised population (Rajão et al., 2020 ), and often results in 
commodity production and delivery to prioritised export markets, 
over local food security (Lenzen et al., 2012).
Conversely, when biodiversity conservation is understood to be 
central to development, more integrated initiatives tend to result, 
including sustainable use reserves and integrated landscape initia -
tives (Carmenta et al., 2020 ). Such approaches contrast land sparing 
actions, and instead represent ‘land sharing’ style solutions to con -
servation development challenges, within which people and nature 
co- exist, often practicing agroecological, low-  input agriculture in di -
verse landscape mosaics (Perfecto & Vandermeer,  2010 ). Integrated 
approaches to conservation and development imperatives are in -
creasingly promoted since they are perceived as capable of address -
ing system dynamics and delivering across social and ecological 
imperatives (Reed et al., 2016 ). Such initiatives involve bundles of 
actions (e.g. land zoning, health care and agroecological intensifica -
tion) in integrated interventions, often in support of rights, and may 
outperform single-  sector style approaches across the remits of con -
servation, agriculture and livelihoods (Carmenta et al.,  2020 ). Many 
are notable because they often stem from grassroots mobilisation 
and achieve greater potential for inclusion of local stakeholders as 
initiative partners (Almeida,  2004 ). However, integrated approaches 
have been criticised largely due to implementation challenges that 
demand extended funding timelines, active engagement and coordi -
nation of diverse stakeholders in a continuing and dynamic process 
(Estrada-  Carmona et al., 2014 ; Milder et al., 2014 ). Given the dis -
tinctions between land-  use- facing interventions, from less to more 
integrated, or along a land sparing, land sharing spectrum, and the 
potential of each to impact people and nature, and the relationship 
between them, there is a crucial need to better understand their 
comparative performance.
The question of what intervention type performs best has been 
addressed by a number of impact studies, yet crucially such assess -
ments have tended to focus on conservation outcomes (e.g. forest KEYWORDS

loss, biodiversity impacts, hunting levels, fire extent; e.g. Carmenta 
et al., 2016 ; Geldmann et al., 2013 ; da Silva et al.,  2018 ; Soares- Filho 
et al., 2010 ). Social indicators of performance are often missing en -
tirely, or, when included, tend towards predefined and externally 
derived metrics focused on material gains and losses related to live -
lihoods (Agarwala et al., 2014 ; Brockington & Schmidt-  Soltau,  2004 ; 
McKinnon et al., 2016 ). These omissions have resulted in calls to ex -
tend our understanding of the benefits and tradeoffs of sharing vs. 
sparing through inclusion of multi- dimensional HWB, including rela -
tional dimensions (Bennett,  2017 ; Phalan, 2018 ; Riechers et al., 2020 ). 
A related bias exists in the ES literature which has tended to assess the 
instrumental ES in economic valuation over the non-  instrumental (be 
they intrinsic or relational; Chan et al., 2012 ; Himes & Muraca, 2018 ). 
The disproportionate focus on instrumental services and material 
constituents of human lives and livelihoods is explained by the gen -
eral conviction that material measures are more tangible, easier to 
quantify and allow for systematised comparative analysis (Devereux 
& McGregor, 2014 ; McGregor et al., 2015 ; Vira & Kontoleon, 2012). 
As a result, the comparative impacts of interventions on the land 
sharing, sparing gradient on the multiple dimensions [i.e. quality of 
life (or subjective), material and relational] of HWB remain poorly un -
derstood (McKinnon et al., 2016 ; Rasmussen et al., 2018 ).
An expansion of HWB indicators to encompass not only mate -
rial but also subjective and relational dimensions has taken place 
(e.g. Agarwala et al., 2014 ; Narayan,  2000 ; Pollnac & Poggie, 2008 ) 
and is recognised by the conservation community (e.g. see Special 
Issue Edisted by Biedenweg & Gross-  Camp, 2018 ), although has 
yet to fully permeate the conservation and agricultural sectors 
(Büscher & Wolmer,  2007 ; McKinnon et al., 2016 ; Rasmussen 
et al., 2018 ). Notably, the relational values imbued within land -
scapes (Chan et al., 2016 ; Chan et al., 2018 ) have received little 
attention in conservation or agriculture impact assessment to 
date, with some notable exceptions (Cundill et al., 2017 ; Riechers 
et al., 2020 ). Similarly, ES literature on conservation and agriculture 
has made relevant advances in operationalising the assessment of 
cultural (including gendered) ES (Chan et al.,  2012 ; Estrada-  Carmona 
et al., 2020 ; Plieninger et al., 2013 ) but have been overshadowed 
by the dominance of instrumental services. Yet relational values are 
likely to contribute disproportionately to HWB in contexts where 
conservation and development initiatives are occurring (Agarwala 
et al., 2014 ; ESPA, 2018 ). Locations where the market economy is 
often peripheral, connection to land is more immediate and peo -
ple depend heavily on affinity networks, moral and gift economies 
(Adams et al., 2008 ; Lima, 2009 ). Importantly, relationships and 
attachments to place may be eroded, recast or replaced as inter -
actions with the landscape are reshaped to conform to new mod -
els of resource use and extraction introduced by land use-  facing 
interventions (Cundill et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, cultural heritage 
and identities are defined by, and enabled through, connections to 
place and land rights struggles are anchored in a discourse of terri -
tory highlighting the centrality of relational values to place-  based 
communities (Basso,  1996 ; Bolanos, 2011 ; Elk et al., 2008 ; Feld & 
Basso, 1996 ; Little, 2003 ).Extending impact assessments to better account for the impacts of 
land use-  facing interventions on locally salient, multi- dimensional HWB 
is essential for a number of reasons. The ‘do no harm’ principle of con -
servation or agriculture is only possible through understanding what 
matters locally, and thus requires meaningful engagement with diverse 
worldviews in favour of superimposing dominant models of develop -
ment rooted in economic rationality (Pascual et al., 2021 ). Recognition 
of the salience of diverse values is particularly necessary as biodiver -
sity conservation continues to situate itself with increasing proxim -
ity to cash poverty alleviation (Miller, 2014 ; Otero et al., 2020 ; Reed 
et al., 2020 ; Roe & Elliott, 2004 ). Perversely, the observed tendency to 
engage a material focus (either through intervention actions or impact 
assessments) may override, or be at odds with, alternative non-  western 
models of human-  nature interactions that exist in the rich biocultural 
landscapes that interventions target (Maffi & Woodley, 2012 ; Muradian 
et al., 2013 ). Plural valuation approaches are essential to ensure more 
just appraisal processes, and themselves can enhance the sustain -
ability and equity of outcomes (Himes & Muraca, 2018 ; Zafra-  Calvo 
et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, a biased focus on the material dimensions of 
well-  being subverts new knowledge, norm and value creation related 
to the contribution of non-  material and relational constituents of HWB 
and instead reinforces capitalist aspirations currently leading to envi -
ronmental collapse (Jacobs et al., 2018 ; Steffen et al., 2015 ).
This study uses a perception-  based impact assessment to under -
stand how distinct land-  use facing interventions along the sharing, 
sparing gradient, have impacted locally defined HWB. In doing so it 
makes a number of advances. These include contributing to closing the 
knowledge gap concerning the comparative performance of land use-  
facing interventions across the land sharing, land sparing gradient on 
multi- dimensional HWB, including relational values. We develop the 
concept of relational values in specific reference to HWB, enhancing 
links between well-  being frameworks (McGregor et al., 2015 ) and con -
temporary understanding of relational values (Chan et al., 2016 , 2018 ). 
Finally, we deliver to a methodological gap by combining perception-  
based impact assessment with a locally grounded approach to un -
derstanding HWB (Agarwala et al., 2014 ). We focus on the Brazilian 
Amazon, a landscape of rapid land use change where conservation and 
agriculture development are held in tension and a suite of land use-  
facing interventions have been introduced. Two research questions 
guided our work: (1) What are locally defined dimensions of HWB in 
the Brazilian Amazon and (2) What perceived impact do land sparing 
versus land sharing interventions have on locally salient HWB?

2.1  |  Study context
The study took place in Pará, Brazil where one third of the state's 
territory is within some form of protection, either in strict use areas 
(containing five different types of conservation areas) or in sustain -
able use reserves. Meanwhile, since the early 2000s, Pará has in -
vested in large-  scale export infrastructure for soy bean combined

with agricultural development loans that have involved deforestation 
(Sauer,  2018 ). Municipalities around the city of Santarém have expe -
rienced agglomeration of small-  scale farms by incoming capitalised 
soy farmers (Sauer,  2018 ). Since 2018, Amazonian forests, including 
in Pará, have come under increased pressure of deforestation due to 
a complexity of political-  economic factors, including the continued 
expansion of cattle ranching and the agro-  industrial frontier, illegal 
logging and fire, fuelled in part by the relaxing of environmental 
controls (Barlow et al., 2020 ; Carvalho et al., 2019 ; Escobar,  2020 ). 
Diverse rural communities are encountered in Pará including various 
indigenous groups, traditional ribeirinho  or caboclo  communities of 
mixed descent, and more recent arrivals of colonist farmers. These 
social groups have specific social histories and different degrees of 
market integration, though most organise production around tradi -
tional smallholder agriculture delivering subsistence needs and sell 
variable surplus at regional markets (Neves, 2007 ).
2.2  |  Intervention types, participant 
communities and households
Field research was conducted over 6 months (June–  November) in 
2019 in four interventions that represent the land sparing, land shar -
ing spectrum. The four interventions were: an area of industrial soy intensification (SOY) and a strict PA, both of which have parallels 
with land sparing strategies through the focus on intensification for 
increased yields, and sparing land for nature (Green et al., 2005 ). 
The two land sharing, more integrated approaches were a sustain -
able use reserve (RESEX) and a national forest (FLONA), which are 
designated multiple use areas, where local peoples are permitted to 
practice traditional small-  scale, low-  input farming and some forest 
use (Almeida,  2004 ; Spínola et al.,  2020 ; Figure  1; Table  1). To avoid 
biasing results through data collection in ‘outlier’ communities, we 
selected two representative communities within each intervention 
type. For each pair, ‘representativeness’ was distinguished by the 
presence of average features along a range of attributes in relation 
to the environment (e.g. fire history), service availability (e.g. energy 
supply) and social characteristics (e.g. colonist or traditional farm -
ers). These attributes were considered relevant for an appraisal of 
well-  being due to their potential influence across well-  being dimen -
sions, and were identified based on the knowledge of the research 
team and local experts ( Table  1). A short open- ended interview was 
conducted with the community president to triangulate the key 
attribute information. All study communities were home to small -
holder family famers and included colonist and traditional peoples.
Within selected communities we held town hall meetings to 
present our research interests and possible outcomes of the work. 
These sought to seek the consent and participation of community

members and therefore involved talking through discussion points 
and questions raised. Research permission was obtained through the 
Brazilian research authorisation system (Biodiversity Authorisation 
and Information System, SISBIO, approval number: 441949/2018- 
5) of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity and Conservation 
(ICMBio). Ethics approval was granted by the University of Cambridge 
ethics committee (Department of Geography, #715).
Community household lists, held by community presidents, en -
abled selection of a random sample of households. Communities 
varied in size yielding different proportions of households inter -
viewed, while households were selected at random, the sample is 
therefore not fully representative of the larger communities. We in -
terviewed either the male or female household heads and achieved a 
sample size of n = 70 households in the RESEX, FLONA and PA, and 
n = 60 households in the SOY intervention. We applied the Global 
Person Generated Index (GPGI) to solicit perceived and prioritised 
HWB constituents from participants, and a questionnaire to collect 
demographic household information including age, gender and main 
livelihood (Table  S1). An overview of the project and intention of 
the survey formed part of the introduction in which there was re- 
emphasis of data anomynity, freedom to opt-  out at any point, and 
request for verbal consent to proceed. Verbal consent was pref -
erable to written consent because of the sensitivy of contract-  like 
formalities.
2.3  |  Global Person Generated Index: Gathering 
emic insights of place-  based human well-  being
The GPGI is a tool for soliciting the place-  based plurality in what con -
stitutes HWB. The GPGI was developed from the Patient Generated 
Index, which has been used extensively to capture subjective well- 
being related to health (Camfield & Ruta, 2007 ). The GPGI solicits 
data on locally percieved well-  being constituents, the relative im -
portance of the different constituents, and the level of satisfaction 
the respondent feels with each constituent. It does so through ap -
plication of a standardised individual semi-  structured interview. The 
GPGI responds to three necessities for measuring what matters to 
people for their well-  being: (i) systematically identifying (i.e. distinct 
from participatory approaches) what is important for people to live 
well and in a way that is locally relevant and determined, yet univer -
sally comprehensible, (ii) assessing people's satisfaction regarding 
what matters most to them and (iii) understanding the relationships, 
trade-  offs and weightings of the constituents of well-  being that are 
locally salient (McGregor et al., 2015 ).
In practice, the GPGI method involves asking respondents to 
identify up to five constituents they regard as central to their well- 
being (Table S1). The respondent then gives a self-  appraisal of their 
level of satisfaction within each constituent, ranging from ‘the worse 
you can imagine’ (−2 on the scale) to ‘exactly as you would like it to 
be’ (+2; OECD, 2013 ). Next, the relative importance (i.e. the weight) 
of each well-  being constituent is indicated by distributing 20 tokens 
across the five constituents. The respondent has the option to leave TABLE 1  Summarised contextual characteristics and service provision within the pairs of study communities located in four distinct types of environment-  facing intervention in the Brazilian

a constituent token-  less or to load one with all 20. Complete satis -
faction across all constituents of well-  being results in a GPGI score 
of 100, whereas scores under 100 indicate the gap between total 
well-  being satisfaction and the individuals actual experience.
Application of the GPGI is suggested as part of a proposed tool -
kit for perception-  based assessment of how conservation interven -
tions impact locally relevant well-  being (Woodhouse et al., 2015 ). 
Therefore, following Rasolofoson et al.  (2018 ), we introduced a 
final step to capture participants' perceptions of the impact of the 
land use-  facing intervention across their well-  being constituents 
(Rasolofoson et al., 2018 ), which was recorded on a scale of very 
negative (−2) to very positive ( +2).
We were particularly interested in capturing subjective, mate-
rial and relational dimensions of HWB some of which may be latent 
constituents –  taken for granted and so not mentioned. To reduce 
the risk of missing these ‘important but forgotten’ constituents we 
introduced a standardised prompt in the introductory explanation 
of the GPGI. The prompt involved the enumerator explaining that 
well-  being may have broad themes including subjective, material 
and relational dimensions, and gave a standardised example of a 
HWB constituent in each dimension to every participant. The GPGI 
is ‘person-  generated’, in that it captures individual, emic, well-  being 
constituents which ensures the place-  based salience of the data, 
however, it does not offer a framework through which to organise 
the multitude of diverse responses given by participants and so is 
usefully combined with a well-  being framework from the theoretical 
literature (see Data Analysis).
As common with other methods to solicit HWB, GPGI can proffer 
some inconsistency between the level of response (constituent) given 
by participants. For example, a response may indicate a HWB outcome 
(e.g. happiness), or the means (e.g. cash) to achieving an unknown well-  
being outcome. We do not have data to distinguish between levels. 
Adaptive preference, particularly in regard to non-  longitudinal data is 
another important issue to consider in well-  being research. The con -
text of the COVID-  19 pandemic illustrates the issue well, namely that 
responses are often contingent on the immediate past. For example, 
if land rights have recently been violated, land rights are likely to be 
cited as central to well-  being. Finally, people tend to feel satisfaction 
relative to their expectations and experiences which may exaggerate 
or limit satisfaction in nuanced ways (Nussbaum, 2000 ). Despite these 
constraints, GPGI has been successfully validated in a number of con -
texts including in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Madagascar, Sri Lanka 
and proven useful to advancing our understanding of what constitutes 
well-  being (Camfield & Ruta, 2007 ; Coulthard et al., 2014 ; Devine 
et al., 2004 ; Rasolofoson et al., 2018 ).
2.4  |  Focus group discussions
We held a series of focus group discussions (FGDs) to better un -
derstand peoples' perceptions of the causal pathways linking in -
terventions with associated impacts on HWB. Researchers invited 
residents during community meetings and follow-  up canvassing, extending the FGD invitation to all. Two FGDs per community were 
held with between 9 and 16 members present. Discussions were or -
ganised into three parts: a general reflection on HWB constituents; 
second, consideration of the extent of intervention impact on these 
constituents and finally, a discussion of the pathways through which 
impacts were perceived to manifest. In each community, partici -
pants were divided into two mixed gender groups. Each group had 
one researcher facilitating and another making notes and documen -
tation via discussion boards and photographs.
2.5  |  Open-  ended interviews with key 
stakeholders
Open-  ended interviews with key stakeholders associated with the 
four intervention types were held. Key stakeholders included indi -
viduals working as reserve managers [Chico Mendes Institute for 
Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio)], environmental agents [Brazilian 
Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources 
(IBAMA)], members of the local rural workers union [Rural workers 
union, (STTR)], NGO representatives [Health and Happiness Project 
(PSA)], agricultural extension agents [Technical Assistance and Rural 
Extension Company (EMATER)] and [Brazilian Agricultural Research 
Corporation scientists (EMBRAPA)] from Santarém and Itaítuba as 
well as extended discussions with multiple community members 
during fieldwork. These data do not directly form part of the current 
study, yet we take note of them here because they served to con -
textualise our interpretation of the findings and articulate discussion 
points.
3 | DATA ANALYSIS
3.1  |  Integrating place-  based human well-  being 
data with existing frameworks
Through the GPGI, 1350 unique responses of well-  being constitu -
ents were reported by participants spanning the subjective, rela -
tional and material dimensions. To structure and present this data, 
we combined two well-  being frameworks. This type of synthesis 
and ‘local flexibility’ are considered essential to construct the inter -
disciplinary frameworks needed to capture the material, subjective 
and relational constituents of HWB (e.g. see the calls from Agarwala 
et al., 2014 ). Specifically, we combined the universal dimensions 
(UDs) from the 3D well-  being ","9868"

Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

CARMENTA ET Al.
1 | INTRODUCTION
In recent years the international policy arena has shown deeper rec -
ognition of the relationship between the environment and human 
well-  being (hereafter HWB). The Intergovernmental Science-  Policy 
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) endeavour 
is documenting the diversity of relationships, including those non-  
instrumental relationships, between people and the natural world 
(Chan et al., 2016 ; Pascual et al., 2017 , 2021 ), the planetary health 
community underscores the interlinkage between environmental 
and human health (Whitmee et al., 2015 ) and the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals emphasise the interdependent nature of de -
velopment and environmental integrity (Schleicher, Schaafsma, & 
Vira, 2018 ). Indeed, the earlier formulation of the ecosystem ser -
vices (ES) concept identified a typology of services on which human -
ity and HWB depend (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,  2005 ). 
However, subsequent application of the ES framework has tended 
towards the dichotomy of instrumental and intrinsic values of na -
ture, overshadowing those non-  instrumental flows between nature 
and the multiple dimensions of HWB (Himes & Muraca, 2018 ; Russell 
et al., 2013 ). In addition, recent advances have helped to recognise, 
quantify and understand the disproportionate contribution of con -
sumption and wealth to environmental collapse (Lenzen et al., 2012 ; 
Otero et al., 2020 ). Yet, despite this progress on the one hand of 
determining the interconnected nature of natural systems and the 
multiple dimensions of HWB, and the disproportionate role of (often 
geographically distant) wealth accumulation in biodiversity decline 
on the other, the geographic focus of many conservation interven -
tions remains centred on site-  level interventions in tropical forest 
landscapes working with the rural poor (McKinnon et al., 2016 ; Reed 
et al., 2020 ; Roe & Elliott, 2004 ). These interventions often attempt 
to achieve a combination of climate, conservation and development 
wins (Miller,  2014 ; Reed et al., 2020 ), which are pursued through dis -
tinct interventions ranging from protected areas (PAs) or agricultural 
intensification, to integrated landscape approaches.
The design of interventions depends on how the relationship 
between development and the environment is framed and under -
stood (Adams et al., 2004 ; Otero et al., 2020 ). Single-  sector inter -
ventions (e.g. those that promote agricultural intensification or PAs) 
stem from a fundamental separation of people and nature (Adams 
et al., 2004 ). PAs, a traditional model of conservation supported 
by influential conservation scientists (e.g. E. O. Wilson), may afford 
biodiversity gains but can result in injustices for residents, includ -
ing eviction from intergenerational homelands (Cundill et al., 2017 ; 
Rai et al., 2019 ), and lost access to resources necessary for liveli -
hoods and livelihood resilience (Agarwala et al., 2014 ; Shepherd et al., 2020 ; West et al., 2006 ). Agricultural intensification is often 
supported by governments (e.g. through subsidies and incen -
tive schemes) concerned with development and growth (Dawson 
et al., 2016 ), and by some conservation scientists who contend that 
intensification (increased output per unit area of crop-  land) can 
spare land for nature (recognised as ‘land sparing’ approaches; Green 
et al., 2005 ). However, intensification also generates social and en -
vironmental burdens that include infringements on HWB particu -
larly for small-  scale land managers peripheral to market economies 
(Dawson et al., 2016 ; Rasmussen et al., 2018 ; Santika et al., 2020 ). 
Furthermore, intensification is associated with land accumulation 
by an elite few in tandem with the disenfranchisement of a larger 
un- capitalised population (Rajão et al., 2020 ), and often results in 
commodity production and delivery to prioritised export markets, 
over local food security (Lenzen et al., 2012).
Conversely, when biodiversity conservation is understood to be 
central to development, more integrated initiatives tend to result, 
including sustainable use reserves and integrated landscape initia -
tives (Carmenta et al., 2020 ). Such approaches contrast land sparing 
actions, and instead represent ‘land sharing’ style solutions to con -
servation development challenges, within which people and nature 
co- exist, often practicing agroecological, low-  input agriculture in di -
verse landscape mosaics (Perfecto & Vandermeer,  2010 ). Integrated 
approaches to conservation and development imperatives are in -
creasingly promoted since they are perceived as capable of address -
ing system dynamics and delivering across social and ecological 
imperatives (Reed et al., 2016 ). Such initiatives involve bundles of 
actions (e.g. land zoning, health care and agroecological intensifica -
tion) in integrated interventions, often in support of rights, and may 
outperform single-  sector style approaches across the remits of con -
servation, agriculture and livelihoods (Carmenta et al.,  2020 ). Many 
are notable because they often stem from grassroots mobilisation 
and achieve greater potential for inclusion of local stakeholders as 
initiative partners (Almeida,  2004 ). However, integrated approaches 
have been criticised largely due to implementation challenges that 
demand extended funding timelines, active engagement and coordi -
nation of diverse stakeholders in a continuing and dynamic process 
(Estrada-  Carmona et al., 2014 ; Milder et al., 2014 ). Given the dis -
tinctions between land-  use- facing interventions, from less to more 
integrated, or along a land sparing, land sharing spectrum, and the 
potential of each to impact people and nature, and the relationship 
between them, there is a crucial need to better understand their 
comparative performance.
The question of what intervention type performs best has been 
addressed by a number of impact studies, yet crucially such assess -
ments have tended to focus on conservation outcomes (e.g. forest KEYWORDS

loss, biodiversity impacts, hunting levels, fire extent; e.g. Carmenta 
et al., 2016 ; Geldmann et al., 2013 ; da Silva et al.,  2018 ; Soares- Filho 
et al., 2010 ). Social indicators of performance are often missing en -
tirely, or, when included, tend towards predefined and externally 
derived metrics focused on material gains and losses related to live -
lihoods (Agarwala et al., 2014 ; Brockington & Schmidt-  Soltau,  2004 ; 
McKinnon et al., 2016 ). These omissions have resulted in calls to ex -
tend our understanding of the benefits and tradeoffs of sharing vs. 
sparing through inclusion of multi- dimensional HWB, including rela -
tional dimensions (Bennett,  2017 ; Phalan, 2018 ; Riechers et al., 2020 ). 
A related bias exists in the ES literature which has tended to assess the 
instrumental ES in economic valuation over the non-  instrumental (be 
they intrinsic or relational; Chan et al., 2012 ; Himes & Muraca, 2018 ). 
The disproportionate focus on instrumental services and material 
constituents of human lives and livelihoods is explained by the gen -
eral conviction that material measures are more tangible, easier to 
quantify and allow for systematised comparative analysis (Devereux 
& McGregor, 2014 ; McGregor et al., 2015 ; Vira & Kontoleon, 2012). 
As a result, the comparative impacts of interventions on the land 
sharing, sparing gradient on the multiple dimensions [i.e. quality of 
life (or subjective), material and relational] of HWB remain poorly un -
derstood (McKinnon et al., 2016 ; Rasmussen et al., 2018 ).
An expansion of HWB indicators to encompass not only mate -
rial but also subjective and relational dimensions has taken place 
(e.g. Agarwala et al., 2014 ; Narayan,  2000 ; Pollnac & Poggie, 2008 ) 
and is recognised by the conservation community (e.g. see Special 
Issue Edisted by Biedenweg & Gross-  Camp, 2018 ), although has 
yet to fully permeate the conservation and agricultural sectors 
(Büscher & Wolmer,  2007 ; McKinnon et al., 2016 ; Rasmussen 
et al., 2018 ). Notably, the relational values imbued within land -
scapes (Chan et al., 2016 ; Chan et al., 2018 ) have received little 
attention in conservation or agriculture impact assessment to 
date, with some notable exceptions (Cundill et al., 2017 ; Riechers 
et al., 2020 ). Similarly, ES literature on conservation and agriculture 
has made relevant advances in operationalising the assessment of 
cultural (including gendered) ES (Chan et al.,  2012 ; Estrada-  Carmona 
et al., 2020 ; Plieninger et al., 2013 ) but have been overshadowed 
by the dominance of instrumental services. Yet relational values are 
likely to contribute disproportionately to HWB in contexts where 
conservation and development initiatives are occurring (Agarwala 
et al., 2014 ; ESPA, 2018 ). Locations where the market economy is 
often peripheral, connection to land is more immediate and peo -
ple depend heavily on affinity networks, moral and gift economies 
(Adams et al., 2008 ; Lima, 2009 ). Importantly, relationships and 
attachments to place may be eroded, recast or replaced as inter -
actions with the landscape are reshaped to conform to new mod -
els of resource use and extraction introduced by land use-  facing 
interventions (Cundill et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, cultural heritage 
and identities are defined by, and enabled through, connections to 
place and land rights struggles are anchored in a discourse of terri -
tory highlighting the centrality of relational values to place-  based 
communities (Basso,  1996 ; Bolanos, 2011 ; Elk et al., 2008 ; Feld & 
Basso, 1996 ; Little, 2003 ).Extending impact assessments to better account for the impacts of 
land use-  facing interventions on locally salient, multi- dimensional HWB 
is essential for a number of reasons. The ‘do no harm’ principle of con -
servation or agriculture is only possible through understanding what 
matters locally, and thus requires meaningful engagement with diverse 
worldviews in favour of superimposing dominant models of develop -
ment rooted in economic rationality (Pascual et al., 2021 ). Recognition 
of the salience of diverse values is particularly necessary as biodiver -
sity conservation continues to situate itself with increasing proxim -
ity to cash poverty alleviation (Miller, 2014 ; Otero et al., 2020 ; Reed 
et al., 2020 ; Roe & Elliott, 2004 ). Perversely, the observed tendency to 
engage a material focus (either through intervention actions or impact 
assessments) may override, or be at odds with, alternative non-  western 
models of human-  nature interactions that exist in the rich biocultural 
landscapes that interventions target (Maffi & Woodley, 2012 ; Muradian 
et al., 2013 ). Plural valuation approaches are essential to ensure more 
just appraisal processes, and themselves can enhance the sustain -
ability and equity of outcomes (Himes & Muraca, 2018 ; Zafra-  Calvo 
et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, a biased focus on the material dimensions of 
well-  being subverts new knowledge, norm and value creation related 
to the contribution of non-  material and relational constituents of HWB 
and instead reinforces capitalist aspirations currently leading to envi -
ronmental collapse (Jacobs et al., 2018 ; Steffen et al., 2015 ).
This study uses a perception-  based impact assessment to under -
stand how distinct land-  use facing interventions along the sharing, 
sparing gradient, have impacted locally defined HWB. In doing so it 
makes a number of advances. These include contributing to closing the 
knowledge gap concerning the comparative performance of land use-  
facing interventions across the land sharing, land sparing gradient on 
multi- dimensional HWB, including relational values. We develop the 
concept of relational values in specific reference to HWB, enhancing 
links between well-  being frameworks (McGregor et al., 2015 ) and con -
temporary understanding of relational values (Chan et al., 2016 , 2018 ). 
Finally, we deliver to a methodological gap by combining perception-  
based impact assessment with a locally grounded approach to un -
derstanding HWB (Agarwala et al., 2014 ). We focus on the Brazilian 
Amazon, a landscape of rapid land use change where conservation and 
agriculture development are held in tension and a suite of land use-  
facing interventions have been introduced. Two research questions 
guided our work: (1) What are locally defined dimensions of HWB in 
the Brazilian Amazon and (2) What perceived impact do land sparing 
versus land sharing interventions have on locally salient HWB?

(Sauer,  2018 ). Municipalities around the city of Santarém have expe -
rienced agglomeration of small-  scale farms by incoming capitalised 
soy farmers (Sauer,  2018 ). Since 2018, Amazonian forests, including 
in Pará, have come under increased pressure of deforestation due to 
a complexity of political-  economic factors, including the continued 
expansion of cattle ranching and the agro-  industrial frontier, illegal 
logging and fire, fuelled in part by the relaxing of environmental 
controls (Barlow et al., 2020 ; Carvalho et al., 2019 ; Escobar,  2020 ). 
Diverse rural communities are encountered in Pará including various 
indigenous groups, traditional ribeirinho  or caboclo  communities of 
mixed descent, and more recent arrivals of colonist farmers. These 
social groups have specific social histories and different degrees of 
market integration, though most organise production around tradi -
tional smallholder agriculture delivering subsistence needs and sell 
variable surplus at regional markets (Neves, 2007 ).
2.2  |  Intervention types, participant 
communities and households
Field research was conducted over 6 months (June–  November) in 
2019 in four interventions that represent the land sparing, land shar -
ing spectrum. The four interventions were: an area of industrial soy intensification (SOY) and a strict PA, both of which have parallels 
with land sparing strategies through the focus on intensification for 
increased yields, and sparing land for nature (Green et al., 2005 ). 
The two land sharing, more integrated approaches were a sustain -
able use reserve (RESEX) and a national forest (FLONA), which are 
designated multiple use areas, where local peoples are permitted to 
practice traditional small-  scale, low-  input farming and some forest 
use (Almeida,  2004 ; Spínola et al.,  2020 ; Figure  1; Table  1). To avoid 
biasing results through data collection in ‘outlier’ communities, we 
selected two representative communities within each intervention 
type. For each pair, ‘representativeness’ was distinguished by the 
presence of average features along a range of attributes in relation 
to the environment (e.g. fire history), service availability (e.g. energy 
supply) and social characteristics (e.g. colonist or traditional farm -
ers). These attributes were considered relevant for an appraisal of 
well-  being due to their potential influence across well-  being dimen -
sions, and were identified based on the knowledge of the research 
team and local experts ( Table  1). A short open- ended interview was 
conducted with the community president to triangulate the key 
attribute information. All study communities were home to small -
holder family famers and included colonist and traditional peoples.
Within selected communities we held town hall meetings to 
present our research interests and possible outcomes of the work. 
These sought to seek the consent and participation of community

and questions raised. Research permission was obtained through the 
Brazilian research authorisation system (Biodiversity Authorisation 
and Information System, SISBIO, approval number: 441949/2018-

varied in size yielding different proportions of households inter -
viewed, while households were selected at random, the sample is 
therefore not fully representative of the larger communities. We in -
terviewed either the male or female household heads and achieved a 
sample size of n = 70 households in the RESEX, FLONA and PA, and 
n = 60 households in the SOY intervention. We applied the Global 
Person Generated Index (GPGI) to solicit perceived and prioritised 
HWB constituents from participants, and a questionnaire to collect 
demographic household information including age, gender and main 
livelihood (Table  S1). An overview of the project and intention of 
the survey formed part of the introduction in which there was re- 
emphasis of data anomynity, freedom to opt-  out at any point, and 
request for verbal consent to proceed. Verbal consent was pref -
erable to written consent because of the sensitivy of contract-  like 
formalities.
2.3  |  Global Person Generated Index: Gathering 
emic insights of place-  based human well-  being
The GPGI is a tool for soliciting the place-  based plurality in what con -
stitutes HWB. The GPGI was developed from the Patient Generated 
Index, which has been used extensively to capture subjective well- 
being related to health (Camfield & Ruta, 2007 ). The GPGI solicits 
data on locally percieved well-  being constituents, the relative im -
portance of the different constituents, and the level of satisfaction 
the respondent feels with each constituent. It does so through ap -
plication of a standardised individual semi-  structured interview. The 
GPGI responds to three necessities for measuring what matters to 
people for their well-  being: (i) systematically identifying (i.e. distinct 
from participatory approaches) what is important for people to live 
well and in a way that is locally relevant and determined, yet univer -
sally comprehensible, (ii) assessing people's satisfaction regarding 
what matters most to them and (iii) understanding the relationships, 
trade-  offs and weightings of the constituents of well-  being that are 
locally salient (McGregor et al., 2015 ).
In practice, the GPGI method involves asking respondents to 
identify up to five constituents they regard as central to their well- 
being (Table S1). The respondent then gives a self-  appraisal of their 
level of satisfaction within each constituent, ranging from ‘the worse 
you can imagine’ (−2 on the scale) to ‘exactly as you would like it to 
be’ (+2; OECD, 2013 ). Next, the relative importance (i.e. the weight) 
of each well-  being constituent is indicated by distributing 20 tokens 
across the five constituents. The respondent has the option to leave TABLE 1  Summarised contextual characteristics and service provision within the pairs of study communities located in four distinct types of environment-  facing intervention in the Brazilian

a constituent token-  less or to load one with all 20. Complete satis -
faction across all constituents of well-  being results in a GPGI score 
of 100, whereas scores under 100 indicate the gap between total 
well-  being satisfaction and the individuals actual experience.
Application of the GPGI is suggested as part of a proposed tool -
kit for perception-  based assessment of how conservation interven -
tions impact locally relevant well-  being (Woodhouse et al., 2015 ). 
Therefore, following Rasolofoson et al.  (2018 ), we introduced a 
final step to capture participants' perceptions of the impact of the 
land use-  facing intervention across their well-  being constituents 
(Rasolofoson et al., 2018 ), which was recorded on a scale of very 
negative (−2) to very positive ( +2).
We were particularly interested in capturing subjective, mate-
rial and relational dimensions of HWB some of which may be latent 
constituents –  taken for granted and so not mentioned. To reduce 
the risk of missing these ‘important but forgotten’ constituents we 
introduced a standardised prompt in the introductory explanation 
of the GPGI. The prompt involved the enumerator explaining that 
well-  being may have broad themes including subjective, material 
and relational dimensions, and gave a standardised example of a 
HWB constituent in each dimension to every participant. The GPGI 
is ‘person-  generated’, in that it captures individual, emic, well-  being 
constituents which ensures the place-  based salience of the data, 
however, it does not offer a framework through which to organise 
the multitude of diverse responses given by participants and so is 
usefully combined with a well-  being framework from the theoretical 
literature (see Data Analysis).
As common with other methods to solicit HWB, GPGI can proffer 
some inconsistency between the level of response (constituent) given 
by participants. For example, a response may indicate a HWB outcome 
(e.g. happiness), or the means (e.g. cash) to achieving an unknown well-  
being outcome. We do not have data to distinguish between levels. 
Adaptive preference, particularly in regard to non-  longitudinal data is 
another important issue to consider in well-  being research. The con -
text of the COVID-  19 pandemic illustrates the issue well, namely that 
responses are often contingent on the immediate past. For example, 
if land rights have recently been violated, land rights are likely to be 
cited as central to well-  being. Finally, people tend to feel satisfaction 
relative to their expectations and experiences which may exaggerate 
or limit satisfaction in nuanced ways (Nussbaum, 2000 ). Despite these 
constraints, GPGI has been successfully validated in a number of con -
texts including in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Madagascar, Sri Lanka 
and proven useful to advancing our understanding of what constitutes 
well-  being (Camfield & Ruta, 2007 ; Coulthard et al., 2014 ; Devine 
et al., 2004 ; Rasolofoson et al., 2018 ).
2.4  |  Focus group discussions
We held a series of focus group discussions (FGDs) to better un -
derstand peoples' perceptions of the causal pathways linking in -
terventions with associated impacts on HWB. Researchers invited 
residents during community meetings and follow-  up canvassing, extending the FGD invitation to all. Two FGDs per community were 
held with between 9 and 16 members present. Discussions were or -
ganised into three parts: a general reflection on HWB constituents; 
second, consideration of the extent of intervention impact on these 
constituents and finally, a discussion of the pathways through which 
impacts were perceived to manifest. In each community, partici -
pants were divided into two mixed gender groups. Each group had 
one researcher facilitating and another making notes and documen -
tation via discussion boards and photographs.
2.5  |  Open-  ended interviews with key 
stakeholders
Open-  ended interviews with key stakeholders associated with the 
four intervention types were held. Key stakeholders included indi -
viduals working as reserve managers [Chico Mendes Institute for 
Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio)], environmental agents [Brazilian 
Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources 
(IBAMA)], members of the local rural workers union [Rural workers 
union, (STTR)], NGO representatives [Health and Happiness Project 
(PSA)], agricultural extension agents [Technical Assistance and Rural 
Extension Company (EMATER)] and [Brazilian Agricultural Research 
Corporation scientists (EMBRAPA)] from Santarém and Itaítuba as 
well as extended discussions with multiple community members 
during fieldwork. These data do not directly form part of the current 
study, yet we take note of them here because they served to con -
textualise our interpretation of the findings and articulate discussion 
points.
3 | DATA ANALYSIS
3.1  |  Integrating place-  based human well-  being 
data with existing frameworks
Through the GPGI, 1350 unique responses of well-  being constitu -
ents were reported by participants spanning the subjective, rela -
tional and material dimensions. To structure and present this data, 
we combined two well-  being frameworks. This type of synthesis 
and ‘local flexibility’ are considered essential to construct the inter -
disciplinary frameworks needed to capture the material, subjective 
and relational constituents of HWB (e.g. see the calls from Agarwala 
et al., 2014 ). Specifically, we combined the universal dimensions 
(UDs) from the 3D well-  being ","9811"

Social Equity in Climate-resilient Agriculture1
The purpose of this Briefing Note is to assist the ClimBeR team and partners to frame issues of 
social equity in building resilience to climate variability and extremes. It identifies what social 
equity means, highlights why attention to social equity is important and provides a framework 
to explore different equity dimensions.
Transformative adaptation
Fair distribution of the benefits of climate-resilient agriculture matters. Inequities in 
development outcomes compound social inequalities that make some people more 
vulnerable to risk than others. Agricultural systems are at particular risk from climate change, 
reinforcing burdens upon people from food insecurity and hunger, employment and economic 
losses, and investment and business uncertainty. As evidence shows, poor and vulnerable 
people disproportionately experience the worst climate impacts.2 Smallholder farmers, 
especially women and young people, are particularly vulnerable to risks that thwart efforts 
to build resilience and improve livelihoods. Lack of attention to social equity undermines the 
potential to build just and sustainable agricultural systems.
Definition of social equity
Social equity is concerned with fairness and justice in how society treats people. This implies 
considering how power, rights, resources, opportunities, and related goods are distributed; 
agreeing principles for fair distribution; and, ensuring that distribution is consistent with these 
principles. 
In terms of climate risk, social equity relates to responsibility for and distribution of climate 
impacts and policies across society, generations and genders, including in terms of who 
participates in and controls decision-making.3 Attention to social equity enables those 
designing projects to consider how social difference and associated inequalities may shape 
vulnerability and may influence people’s access to innovations to build resilience or improve 
their livelihoods.  This encompasses how project design and implementation can contribute to 
the distribution of fair outcomes. 
Equity is subtly different from equality. Equality refers to being the same or being treated 
equally. While equity also relates to equivalence, it might mean treating people differently to 
overcome barriers that impede achieving equal outcomes. This recognises that people do not 
start from the same set of circumstances and that there could be unfair, unjust or exclusionary 
processes that create their situation.4
Without accounting for equity, thinking of equality as an end in itself can be relatively 
detrimental to the weaker group. Paying attention to power relations is critical – equity 
and empowerment can and should go hand-in-hand. Equity is about how advantages or 
disadvantages are distributed; empowerment considers how to take action to improve those 
circumstances, for an individual or a group of people.5

With social equity integrated into its design and implementation, the ClimBeR initiative is 
working towards the following three-year outcomes: 
1. The use of bundled (consolidated) climate services developed by ClimBeR by at least 
300,000 vulnerable farmers in the six focal countries, of whom at least 30 percent are 
women. 
2. International agencies and policymakers will use products developed by ClimBeR 
researchers and partners to shape at least nine policies or investments to strengthen 
agricultural resilience, including at least three aimed at reducing agriculture-related 
climate security risk. 
3. At least US$30 million in new investments will be made through ClimBeR’s partnerships, 
focusing on smallholder farmers who are vulnerable to climate risk, including women, 
young people, and other disadvantaged groups, contributing to building systemic 
resilience.
Social equity in agricultural systems
Social equity can be material, in terms of fairness in access to necessities for a worthwhile life, 
and moral, in terms of treating or representing people or things with due fairness, respect 
or appreciation.10 It encompasses issues of gender equality and women’s empowerment, 
but also intersects with other social divisions that affects young people and groups who are 
disadvantaged in a particular context due to ethnicity, caste, etc.
Leach et al. (2018) argue there are multiple forms of equity, which can be divided between 
’equity of what?’ and ‘equity between whom?’11 Inequity arises from complex and 
multidimensional inequalities, manifest through forms of disadvantage or privilege, within 
and between generations. Understanding how different social inequalities and power relations 
converge to shape vulnerability to climate extremes is important to effectively address the 
impacts of climate risk, including the extent of individuals’ and groups’ decision-making power 
in relation to climate adaptation.12 
Low-income groups, women, indigenous peoples, older or young people, ethnic and 
racial minorities, and people with disabilities are broadly acknowledged as experiencing 
marginalisation and vulnerability to climate impacts.13 The resulting disadvantages and 
inequalities become apparent in different ways, at different scales. In the context of exposure 
to climate risk, they are typically associated with structural injustices that have historical roots 
and are contextually specific.14Transformative adaptation – actions needed to address root causes rather than symptoms 
of vulnerability6 – is a powerful strategy that has emerged to build resilience in agricultural 
systems. Through forecasting the direction of climate change, adaptation incorporates 
mechanisms to pre-empt and protect against climate risk, thus contributing to sustainability. 
However, a focus on social equity has not been a key component of the design of climate 
adaptation strategies.7 This is a critical issue because addressing climate risk through 
adaptation reinforces inequities, creating winners and losers. These inequities and related 
social inequalities, including those connected to the uneven distribution of climate risk, shape 
resilience building. 
At worst, lack of attention to issues of social equity contributes to maladaptation, when 
adaptation strategies go wrong, leaving people more exposed to climate risks and new hazards 
as unintended outcomes of an intervention.8 Early approaches to climate adaptation conveyed 
the notion of ’win-win’ strategies as guiding principles. Over time, however, it has become 
clear that responding to climate change is complex and rarely is any strategy only positive.9 
Hence, until projects directly address the root causes of vulnerability, maladaptation will 
continue to be a risk for those who are most vulnerable. Therefore, considering the distribution 
of benefits – particularly among groups of women, young people and others who are socially 
disadvantaged – requires systematic attention to social equity. 
To ensure socially just and inclusive transformative adaptation, the CGIAR initiative ‘Building 
Systemic Resilience to Climate Variability and Extremes’ (ClimBeR) and its project partners in 
focal countries (Guatemala, Kenya, Morocco, the Philippines, Senegal and Zambia) address 
social equity as integral to agricultural system sustainability. Attention to social equity requires 
identifying opportunities to ensure resilience building is fair and equitable in different 
components of the project and at different scales. It implies a need for context-specific actions 
to tackle vulnerability, in terms of people’s exposure to climate risk, because this risk and 
associated vulnerability differs according to a range of environmental, social, economic, cultural 
and political factors. Within project design and implementation, this means paying attention 
to entrenched, unequal gender and power relations, including addressing how these relations 
create barriers to adaptation.

• Procedural equity  – how decisions 
are made, and the extent to which 
different groups of people can 
influence those decisions or have 
their knowledge and perspectives 
represented or incorporated, through 
the roles of institutions, governance 
and participation. Procedural equity 
is concerned with governance and 
decision-making. It incorporates 
knowledge dynamics and issues of 
social inclusion or exclusion. It may 
also encompass decisions over how 
to give value to the environment or 
non-human species within farming 
systems.
• Distributional equity  – how 
resources, costs and benefits, 
including for environmental or 
climate measures, are distributed 
between people and groups. 
Distributional equity feeds into the 
cycle of the intervention, contributing 
to subsequent processes of 
recognitional and procedural equity.
• Intergenerational equity  – how 
justice and injustice are perpetuated 
or change through generations. 
Transforming agricultural systems 
brings forward a long-term view. It 
may start with young people today 
but also consider the preferences 
of future generations. This may or 
may not align with current notions 
of stewardship within smallholder 
farming.Equity of what? 
ClimBeR’s work on climate-resilient agriculture will ensure equity in agricultural 
systems takes context into account, including the following types of factors: 
• economic (incomes, assets, capital)
• environmental (endowments and entitlements; exposure to climate risks; 
threatened loss of species and erosion of biodiversity in farming systems; agency 
to adapt to environmental threats)
• societal (status, rights and experiences)
• cultural (culinary cultures and diets; types of food crops)
• political (capacity to influence and benefit from political decisions; collective and 
political action; dimensions of peace and security)
• technological (co-development of technology, access to technology; forms of 
innovation).
Equity between whom?
ClimBeR works closely with partner institutions to design and implement activities that 
acknowledge differences between individuals and groups, while including occurrences 
of intersectionality, encompassing differences that include:
•  gender
• age/generation
• ethnicity
• class/socioeconomic status
• disability 
• race
• caste
Attention to these differences helps probe how they shape vulnerability and capacity to 
build resilience in agricultural systems.
Typology of equity
A typology of equity can be used in project design and implementation, framing 
the scope of equity (of what and between whom) within agricultural systems 
transformation (Figure 1). This typology divides equity into four dimensions:15 
• Recognitional equity  – how acknowledgement and respect are given to human 
identity, values, social norms and rights. This may include relationships to the 
environment and non-human species. Forms of cultural and political domination, 
typically with structural, historical roots, can underpin injustices flowing from 
inequities of recognition. Therefore, this requires changing power structures, 
considering how to empower people to have a voice and shape change. Attention 
to recognitional equity may generate more inclusive and democratic forms of 
governance. Recognitional equity establishes the context of an intervention 
that forms the basis for procedural equity to emerge through governance and 
decision-making.

Adapting these notions of equity to the context of agricultural systems, helps address 
the dynamics of social equity in practice,16 providing a way to tease out tensions between 
competing claims and equity issues at different sites and scales in the system, ultimately 
seeking to generate just outcomes. 
In ClimBeR, activities focus on the following four work packages: 
1. De-RISK  – reducing risk for producers’ livelihoods and in value chains, employing 
agricultural risk management, climate-smart innovations and digital services to reduce 
the impact of variable weather and extreme events on smallholder farmers.
2. Climate Security  – understanding climate security risks and identifying paths to climate-
resilient peace, including equitable access to natural resources.
3. Policy Pathways  – ensuring policymakers have the evidence necessary to develop 
urgently needed, holistic and context-specific policies, as well as untangling complexities 
across natural and social sciences that hinder progress.
4. Governance for Resilience  – building capacity for policies that bring together local 
needs and available tools to enable governance for resilience, working across levels, 
scales and sectors and drawing out ‘champions of change’ who can advocate for local 
investment and empowerment, and inclusion for all.
There are strengthened and complemented by two cross-cutting themes:
5. Climate Finance  – scaling climate finance, with innovative mechanisms that increase 
farmers’ access to finance at local level, and help policymakers identify new opportunities 
at national level.
6. Gender, Youth and Social Equity  – because a climate-resilient, nutrition-secure future 
will require gender-sensitive policy, ensuring grassroots voices are heard and women, 
young people and disadvantaged groups are included.Figure 1. Social equity framework to guide climate change research and generate equitable and sustainable transformative change.

Social Equity in Climate-resilient Agriculture1
The purpose of this Briefing Note is to assist the ClimBeR team and partners to frame issues of 
social equity in building resilience to climate variability and extremes. It identifies what social 
equity means, highlights why attention to social equity is important and provides a framework 
to explore different equity dimensions.
Transformative adaptation
Fair distribution of the benefits of climate-resilient agriculture matters. Inequities in 
development outcomes compound social inequalities that make some people more 
vulnerable to risk than others. Agricultural systems are at particular risk from climate change, 
reinforcing burdens upon people from food insecurity and hunger, employment and economic 
losses, and investment and business uncertainty. As evidence shows, poor and vulnerable 
people disproportionately experience the worst climate impacts.2 Smallholder farmers, 
especially women and young people, are particularly vulnerable to risks that thwart efforts 
to build resilience and improve livelihoods. Lack of attention to social equity undermines the 
potential to build just and sustainable agricultural systems.
Definition of social equity
Social equity is concerned with fairness and justice in how society treats people. This implies 
considering how power, rights, resources, opportunities, and related goods are distributed; 
agreeing principles for fair distribution; and, ensuring that distribution is consistent with these 
principles. 
In terms of climate risk, social equity relates to responsibility for and distribution of climate 
impacts and policies across society, generations and genders, including in terms of who 
participates in and controls decision-making.3 Attention to social equity enables those 
designing projects to consider how social difference and associated inequalities may shape 
vulnerability and may influence people’s access to innovations to build resilience or improve 
their livelihoods.  This encompasses how project design and implementation can contribute to 
the distribution of fair outcomes. 
Equity is subtly different from equality. Equality refers to being the same or being treated 
equally. While equity also relates to equivalence, it might mean treating people differently to 
overcome barriers that impede achieving equal outcomes. This recognises that people do not 
start from the same set of circumstances and that there could be unfair, unjust or exclusionary 
processes that create their situation.4
Without accounting for equity, thinking of equality as an end in itself can be relatively 
detrimental to the weaker group. Paying attention to power relations is critical – equity 
and empowerment can and should go hand-in-hand. Equity is about how advantages or 
disadvantages are distributed; empowerment considers how to take action to improve those 
circumstances, for an individual or a group of people.5

With social equity integrated into its design and implementation, the ClimBeR initiative is 
working towards the following three-year outcomes: 
1. The use of bundled (consolidated) climate services developed by ClimBeR by at least 
300,000 vulnerable farmers in the six focal countries, of whom at least 30 percent are 
women. 
2. International agencies and policymakers will use products developed by ClimBeR 
researchers and partners to shape at least nine policies or investments to strengthen 
agricultural resilience, including at least three aimed at reducing agriculture-related 
climate security risk. 
3. At least US$30 million in new investments will be made through ClimBeR’s partnerships, 
focusing on smallholder farmers who are vulnerable to climate risk, including women, 
young people, and other disadvantaged groups, contributing to building systemic 
resilience.
Social equity in agricultural systems
Social equity can be material, in terms of fairness in access to necessities for a worthwhile life, 
and moral, in terms of treating or representing people or things with due fairness, respect 
or appreciation.10 It encompasses issues of gender equality and women’s empowerment, 
but also intersects with other social divisions that affects young people and groups who are 
disadvantaged in a particular context due to ethnicity, caste, etc.
Leach et al. (2018) argue there are multiple forms of equity, which can be divided between 
’equity of what?’ and ‘equity between whom?’11 Inequity arises from complex and 
multidimensional inequalities, manifest through forms of disadvantage or privilege, within 
and between generations. Understanding how different social inequalities and power relations 
converge to shape vulnerability to climate extremes is important to effectively address the 
impacts of climate risk, including the extent of individuals’ and groups’ decision-making power 
in relation to climate adaptation.12 
Low-income groups, women, indigenous peoples, older or young people, ethnic and 
racial minorities, and people with disabilities are broadly acknowledged as experiencing 
marginalisation and vulnerability to climate impacts.13 The resulting disadvantages and 
inequalities become apparent in different ways, at different scales. In the context of exposure 
to climate risk, they are typically associated with structural injustices that have historical roots 
and are contextually specific.14Transformative adaptation – actions needed to address root causes rather than symptoms 
of vulnerability6 – is a powerful strategy that has emerged to build resilience in agricultural 
systems. Through forecasting the direction of climate change, adaptation incorporates 
mechanisms to pre-empt and protect against climate risk, thus contributing to sustainability. 
However, a focus on social equity has not been a key component of the design of climate 
adaptation strategies.7 This is a critical issue because addressing climate risk through 
adaptation reinforces inequities, creating winners and losers. These inequities and related 
social inequalities, including those connected to the uneven distribution of climate risk, shape 
resilience building. 
At worst, lack of attention to issues of social equity contributes to maladaptation, when 
adaptation strategies go wrong, leaving people more exposed to climate risks and new hazards 
as unintended outcomes of an intervention.8 Early approaches to climate adaptation conveyed 
the notion of ’win-win’ strategies as guiding principles. Over time, however, it has become 
clear that responding to climate change is complex and rarely is any strategy only positive.9 
Hence, until projects directly address the root causes of vulnerability, maladaptation will 
continue to be a risk for those who are most vulnerable. Therefore, considering the distribution 
of benefits – particularly among groups of women, young people and others who are socially 
disadvantaged – requires systematic attention to social equity. 
To ensure socially just and inclusive transformative adaptation, the CGIAR initiative ‘Building 
Systemic Resilience to Climate Variability and Extremes’ (ClimBeR) and its project partners in 
focal countries (Guatemala, Kenya, Morocco, the Philippines, Senegal and Zambia) address 
social equity as integral to agricultural system sustainability. Attention to social equity requires 
identifying opportunities to ensure resilience building is fair and equitable in different 
components of the project and at different scales. It implies a need for context-specific actions 
to tackle vulnerability, in terms of people’s exposure to climate risk, because this risk and 
associated vulnerability differs according to a range of environmental, social, economic, cultural 
and political factors. Within project design and implementation, this means paying attention 
to entrenched, unequal gender and power relations, including addressing how these relations 
create barriers to adaptation.

• Procedural equity  – how decisions 
are made, and the extent to which 
different groups of people can 
influence those decisions or have 
their knowledge and perspectives 
represented or incorporated, through 
the roles of institutions, governance 
and participation. Procedural equity 
is concerned with governance and 
decision-making. It incorporates 
knowledge dynamics and issues of 
social inclusion or exclusion. It may 
also encompass decisions over how 
to give value to the environment or 
non-human species within farming 
systems.
• Distributional equity  – how 
resources, costs and benefits, 
including for environmental or 
climate measures, are distributed 
between people and groups. 
Distributional equity feeds into the

"27","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**
