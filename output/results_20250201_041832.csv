The document offers detailed instructions on establishing user accounts, installing the app, a step-by-step process for accessing and collecting groundwater monitoring data, and guidelines for form submission, editing, and uploading. These elements demonstrate that the key conceptual framework of the innovation has been formulated and a prototype (in this case, the manual) has been produced. However, there is no evidence of subsequent testing under controlled or semi‐controlled conditions, nor has there been any pilot study or field trial that validates its performance in achieving a specific impact. As such, based on the innovation readiness scale, the manual meets the requirements for Level 3, which indicates that the key concepts have been validated through its development and internal review, but it remains untested in practical application. This classification is consistent with the criteria for Level 3, where a proof of concept exists without any external or controlled testing evidence."

The controlled nature of the training, characterized by its invitation-only format and pre-defined participant group, confirmed the innovation’s conceptual underpinnings and its capacity to support Ethiopia’s food systems transformation roadmap. As there was no indication that the training had been deployed under semi-controlled or uncontrolled conditions, nor that it had reached the stage of broad operational implementation (proven impact in open field conditions), the initiative aligns with the Early Prototype stage of innovation readiness. Consequently, the completed activities validate the innovation’s potential impact under controlled conditions, justifying a score of 5 on the Innovation Readiness Scale."

Two workshops were implemented in the agroecological zones of Mandla, emphasizing consultation and dialogue with farmers, fishers, and government officials. This execution confirmed that the concept of using structured workshops as a mechanism for fostering stakeholder engagement in aquatic food systems was feasible. However, the activities did not extend into rigorous performance testing or provide measurable outcomes regarding the achievement of specific impacts, as would be expected in later stages of innovation readiness. The initiative validated the basic concept in a practical, real‐world setting, yet it did not progress to controlled or semi-controlled conditions and therefore did not test its ability to achieve definitive impact. In this sense, the activities align with the “Proof of Concept” stage on the Innovation Readiness Scale, whereby key concepts were demonstrated through initial application but require further development and evidence to be classified at a higher readiness level.""
