The research involved the identification and validation of genomic regions controlling 1,000-kernel weight in durum wheat under terminal drought conditions. The study utilized a nested association mapping panel evaluated across eight environments with varying degrees of moisture stress, confirming the impact of drought on yield and the importance of 1,000-kernel weight for adaptation. The identification of 18 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and the conversion of significant SNPs to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers were key achievements. These markers were validated in a third germplasm set, explaining up to 19% of phenotypic variation for TKW under moisture stress. The successful field testing and validation of these markers in uncontrolled conditions demonstrate the innovation's readiness for practical application in molecular breeding, thus justifying the highest readiness level."
