"37","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o","Environment","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

"37","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","o1-mini","Environment","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

"1006","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

 1. Introduction  
 
Brachiaria ( Urochloa  spp.) and Panicum grasses ( Megathyrsus  spp.) are two important 
tropical forage species indigenous to Africa that are widely cultivated in Africa, South America, 
Australia and East Asia and have demonstrated success in transforming beef and dairy 
industries. They are perennial, fast growing wit h high biomass production potential, palatable 
and nutritious to livestock. They possess large root systems, fix carbon in soils, and are 
adapted to drought and a wide variety of soils, tolerant to shade, waterlogging and to pests 
and diseases. Brachiaria and Panicum grasses are extensively used for grazing, cut -and-carry, 
and silage and hay production. Improved cultivars are high yielding, responsive to fertilizer 
applications, persistent and can remain green long into the dry season.   
 
Multi-locational a gronomic and farmer participatory evaluation of the performance of 
resilient and drought adapted forage cultivars and hybrids will identify best options for the 
different regions and livestock systems in the country. Validation at farmers’ fields (e.g., as  
part of Farmer Field Schools) will increase awareness and provide information of the impact 
on animal productivity and environmental indicators. Seed availability will be increased by 
seed multiplication by government institutions (such as IER), private s ector and farmers. This 
will lead to an increased adoption of these materials and improve productivity and income of 
households keeping small ruminants.  
This report presents the preliminary results of the forage trials in Mali  implemented by 
l’Instititut d’Economie Rurale (IER ) as part of the CGIAR Research Initiative on Sustainable 
Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender inclusion (SAPLING) . 
 
Key elements:  
• Resilient and drought adapted forage cultivars and hy brids  (Urochloa , Megathyrsus , 
Crotalaria, etc) for their scaling up.  
• Evidence of improved forages and food -feed varieties and ‘food rations generated”.  
• Training for forage seed producers

 2. Methodology  
 
Treatments and experimental design  
 
The initial evaluations of forage cultivars are carried out at three sites:  
1. Barouéli (Ségou region) , rainfall 500 mm. from June to September  
2. Farakala (Sikasso region) , rainfall 1000 mm, from May to September  
3. The IER Research Station (Sotuba , Bamako ), rainfall 750 mm, from May to September  
 
The performance of forage species/cultivars is also  assessed by the farmers and other 
stakeholders visiting the experimental plots at different stages (e.g., at establishment, full 
vegetative stage and maturity), and  the preferred technology will be identified for on -farm 
evaluation as outreach research activities.  
 
Number of treatments : 11 improved forage cultivars and hybrids, and 2 local forages.

 Management  
 
• Sowing: At onset of rains (direct seeding ), July 2023  
• Basal F ertilizer :  Fertilizer was applied at the rate of 100:60:30 kg N: P 2O5: K2O / ha.  
• Top dressing fertilizer: After 12 weeks after the establishment, nitrogenous fertilizer  was 
applied  at a rate of 100 kg N/ha in two equal split doses.  
• The weeds were removed manually from the plots.  
• No control of p ests and diseases  takes place . 
 
Data collection  
 
The following data are collected:  
• Rainfall, temperature (mean maximum and minimum) and relative humidity data in 
monthly basis from the nearest meteorological station for entire experimental period.  
• To maintain uniformity on the initial growth among forage species/ cultivars tested 
perform standardization cut at six weeks of germination by cutting 5 cm above the ground 
level.  
• Plant population : Plants are counted  within a 1m x 1m frame, randomly place d over the 2 
central rows at 4 weeks interval during establishment phase and at 8 weeks interval during 
the production phase.  
• Plant height : Similarly measure the height of 4 plants within the 1 x 1 m frame at the same 
interval as tiller numbers above.  
• Pest s and diseases : Assess pests and diseases incidences and record data every month 
throughout the experimental period. It is advisable to take the digital photographs of pest 
and diseases in each forage species /cultivars.  
• Dry matter yield : The first dry mat ter yield is taken at maturity from 2 x 2 m2 net harvest 
area per plot, harvested fresh material  is weighed  and sub-samples are collected and dr ied 
at 105oC for 48 hours for dry weight determination. Subsequent harvests are conducted 
after every 8 weeks.  
• Analysis of nutritive values : Each forage species/cultivar evaluated are subjected to 
nutritive value analysis including Crude Protein (CP), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid 
Detergent Fiber (ADF), Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL), Metabolizable Energy (ME), A sh, 
Calcium (Ca), Phosphorus (P) and others. For this purpose, herbage collected from 8 weeks 
harvest in wet and dry season of a year is used.

 3. Results  
 
The following table s show pictures of the three different research sites taken in the same 
week of 18 December 2023 and five months after planting.  Differences between the different 
sites are considerable, especially but not surprisingly between the Barouéli site on the one 
hand and the Farakala en Sotuba sites on the other.   
 
Barouéli  Farakala  Sotuba  
   
Andropogon gayanus  
Performing well in both Farakala (ranked 6th by farmers) and S otuba, regular in Barouéli  
 
  
  
 
Crotalaria juncea  
Not performing well at any of the sites , ranked last in Farakala . We saw the same at the Ghana 
sites whereas at the Senegal sites the C. juncea performed very well. At the Sotuba site a local 
Crotalaria  showed good performance. According to literature, soil type and Ph should not be a 
constraint, but low soil fertility (P) might be a main cause for the poor performance in Mali and 
Ghana, Senegal  site probably having higher soil fertility because of residual nutrients from former 
crops.

 Barouéli  Farakala  Sotuba  
   
Megathyrsus maximus  cv ""Maasai""  
Performing quite well at all sites, ranked highest by farmers in Farakala , and ranked 4th in 
Barouéli  
   
Megathyrsus maximus  cv ""Mombasa""  
Poor performance in Barouéli, good performance in Farakala  (ranked 8th by farmers)  
   
Megathyrsus maximus  cv ""Mun River""  
Poor performance in Barouéli, good performance in Farakala  (ranked 3rd) and Sotuba. Well 
appreciated by farmers.

Urochloa  hybrid  GP1794 ""Cobra""  
Good performance at all three sites.  
In Barouéli r anked highest by farmers  because of  high biomass production, density, erect growth 
habit and adapted to dry season, dry season availability of green forage. In Farakala ranked 9th. 
Proposed use: dairy cattle, fattening (cattle, small ruminants)  
   
Urochloa brizantha   cv “Marandu”  
Good performance at all three sites.  
In Barouéli ranked 3rd by farmers, because of biomass production and adaptation to drought, in 
Farakala ranked 7th.

Urochloa ruziziensis  
Poor  performance in Barouéli, good performance in Farakala (ranked 4th) and Sotuba . Many 
farmers in Farakala grow U. ruziziensis , producing forage as well as seeds.  
   
Urochloa  hybrid  CIATGP1005BR ""Talisman""  
Good performance at all three sites.  
In Barouéli ranked second by farmers, because of (green) biomass production and adaptation to

4. Conclusions and next steps  
 
• This report  is entirely based on visual observations and farmers  evaluations. A second 
report with the  analysis of the  agronomic data will be made available early 2024.  
• The observations and farmer evaluations were conducted  at five months after planting 
and approximately two months into the dry season.  They will be repeated in approx. 
three (mid dry season) and six months (end dry season).  
• In the drier region (Barouéli) the Bracharia/Urochloa gras ses are preferred over  the 
Panicum / Megathyrsus materials , whereas the more humid region (Farakala ) shows the 
opposite . This might change as the dry season progresses  and the Panicum grasses are 
likely to also suffer more in the more humid zone.  
• There see m to be good p erspectives for some of the hybrids ( especially Cobra, Talisman, 
Camello ). Farmers like their adaptation to drought and, in particular for Cobra, their 
suitability for use as a cut -and-carry feed.

 3. Results  
 
The following table s show pictures of the three different research sites taken in the same 
week of 18 December 2023 and five months after planting.  Differences between the different 
sites are considerable, especially but not surprisingly between the Barouéli site on the one 
hand and the Farakala en Sotuba sites on the other.   
 
Barouéli  Farakala  Sotuba  
   
Andropogon gayanus  
Performing well in both Farakala (ranked 6th by farmers) and S otuba, regular in Barouéli  
 
  
  
 
Crotalaria juncea  
Not performing well at any of the sites , ranked last in Farakala . We saw the same at the Ghana 
sites whereas at the Senegal sites the C. juncea performed very well. At the Sotuba site a local 
Crotalaria  showed good performance. According to literature, soil type and Ph should not be a 
constraint, but low soil fertility (P) might be a main cause for the poor performance in Mali and 
Ghana, Senegal  site probably having higher soil fertility because of residual nutrients from former 
crops.

4. Conclusions and next steps  
 
• This report  is entirely based on visual observations and farmers  evaluations. A second 
report with the  analysis of the  agronomic data will be made available early 2024.  
• The observations and farmer evaluations were conducted  at five months after planting 
and approximately two months into the dry season.  They will be repeated in approx. 
three (mid dry season) and six months (end dry season).  
• In the drier region (Barouéli) the Bracharia/Urochloa gras ses are preferred over  the 
Panicum / Megathyrsus materials , whereas the more humid region (Farakala ) shows the 
opposite . This might change as the dry season progresses  and the Panicum grasses are 
likely to also suffer more in the more humid zone.  
• There see m to be good p erspectives for some of the hybrids ( especially Cobra, Talisman, 
Camello ). Farmers like their adaptation to drought and, in particular for Cobra, their 
suitability for use as a cut -and-carry feed.

Improving their performance, especially with respect to services they offer to farmers, therefore present significant opportunities. This is more so in a country like Tanzania where the private sector involvement in key commodity value chains remains weak despite the enormous potential of the value chains to improve smallholder access to inputs and services, incomes, food and nutrition security and create jobs. Some of the major current limitations to private sector growth include lack of knowledge and coordination among actors. Successful business training and coordination among actors have been shown to significantly increase the probability of success for both start-ups and established businesses.

Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs 
and linked households for testing 
delivery of bundled technology packages 
in Tanzania  
James Rao, Immaculate Omondi, Jane Poole and Amos Omore
Key messages
• Designing and conducting the selection of 
agripreneurs and households to test delivery of 
bundled technology packages is complex given the 
many factors that need to be considered.
• Statistical matching technique was used to select 
agripreneurs (APs) and consequently leading to the 
identification of households that were likely to be 
linked to the APs and to producer organizations 
where the APs operated.
• The complexities of the selection of APs and 
households should be factored into the analysis 
as much as possible following an endline survey 
to include measuring the effect of Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of a 
technology package or a combination because 
different agripreneurs take up different baskets of 
interventions in different areas.Introduction
Maziwa Zaidi partners identified a set of integrated 
intervention packages (Omore et al. 2019) to be 
tested and delivered as part of the implementation 
of the project on ‘Agri-entrepreneurship, technology 
uptake and inclusive dairy development in T anzania.’ 
The testing and delivery were through empowered 
and appropriately skilled agripreneurs (APs) who were 
expected to also profit from promoting the uptake of the 
prioritized technology packages by smallholder dairy 
farmers linked to them. 
To achieve this aim, the capacity of the APs would be 
strengthened in selected agribusiness knowledge 
areas and skills by incubation service providers. This 
intervention included gender-responsive incubation, 
acceleration, training and mentoring of APs engaged 
in the provision of inputs and services in project sites.

|       Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in TanzaniaFollowing the capacity building, changes in behaviour 
among APs in relation to the delivery of services would 
be monitored in both intervention and control districts 
and wards qualitatively and quantitatively . Qualitative 
monitoring of outcomes would be conducted through 
knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) analysis 
guided by a theory of change developed at the onset. 
Quantitative monitoring would be done through 
baseline and endline surveys of APs and households  
to capture changes in the use of inputs and services by 
HHs linked to the capacitated APs.
This research brief summarizes 1) the methodology 
including the process of selecting APs and HHs and 
2) the results of the selection process. The selection 
process is summarized based on the baseline data 
available at this portal: Maziwa Zaidi/More Milk in 
T anzania (phase II) - Datasets - ILRI Datasets Portal .
 
This intervention included gender-responsive 
incubation, acceleration, training and mentoring of 
the agripreneurs engaged in the provision of inputs 
and services in project sites. The project sites were 
selected based on the need to align with ongoing 
development projects that could facilitate the 
uptake of technology packages  in Kilimanjaro and 
T anga regions of T anzania .
Methodology
Two regions, namely Kilimanjaro and T anga and 
four districts within them (Hai, Siha, Korogwe and 
Muheza) were selected based on the need to align 
with ongoing development projects that could 
facilitate the uptake of technology packages. Within 
each intervention, districts are wards with cattle 
keepers linked to the APs. The selected wards 
are geographically clustered around producer 
organizations (POs) also linked to the APs. Two 
control districts (Moshi Rural and Rombo) with similar 
production and market systems were also identified, 
both in the Kilimanjaro region. Project wards were 
identified by the overlap between the geographical 
catchment of cooperatives/POs and the geographical 
areas from where the project selected APs to draw 
their clients. From these overlapping areas, a random 
selection of wards was made. These are the project 
implementation areas. The selection of APs and HHs 
was carried out in three stages: scoping, selection of 
APs and identification of target HHs (Figure 1).Figure 1: Sampling of agripreneurs and households in treatment and 
control districts.
Stage 1: Scoping  
A scoping exercise was done in October and November 
2020 across the six districts to generate an initial long list 
of all APs in project sites and their networks, including 
the POs/cooperatives that they work with. Sampling 
was informed by the need to have enough to cover 
the diversity of APs and have a sufficiently long list from 
which to select about 50 APs across certain criteria in 
both intervention and control areas. The scoping relied 
on key informant interviews and a snowballing approach 
to generate the long list. 
A total of 57 key informants (mainly ward extension 
officers) and 51 respondents from POs were interviewed, 
through partners in the project implementation area. An 
expanded list of APs was generated from the interviews 
and further snowballed to identify all the APs in the project 
implementation site. This was done by first interviewing 
the identified informants and respondents, to generate 
information on APs in the area, then interviewing all the 
identified APs from the snowball sampling interviews.
 
From the 57 key informants and 51 respondents from 
POs, names of APs operating in the study sites were 
obtained and further names were generated from 
interviewing each of the identified APs from the list. This 
snowball sampling process generated a list of 427 APs. 
Out of this list, the goal was to interview all the listed APs 
who operated within the project implementation areas. 
Since the broader list contained some APs who operated 
outside the area and some who were unavailable due 
to changing their area of operation or other reasons, in 
total, 291 APs were interviewed.
The survey , using a structured survey tool, collected 
minimum data for characterizing these agripreneurs. Data 
on type of enterprises, gender of the entrepreneur, area 
of operation, products and services offered and training 
needs, was obtained. The data generated from the 
scoping survey was used to inform the second stage of 
the selection of those who would be invited to participate 
in the intervention or be part of the control group.

Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in Tanzania           |Stage 2: Selection of agripreneurs  
Initial data from the scoping study was used for the 
selection of intervention APs. The 291 APs were first 
scored based on the criteria listed below, including 
abbreviations in the data portal.
1. Type of business and level of bundling (breeding, 
animal health, agro-dealer, feed supplier, etc.)
2. Linkages that APs have with POs/cooperatives or 
overlap between the PO and AP at the ward level 
(AP_PO_overlap)
3. Scale of operation – clientele and the geographical 
location of most of their clients: 
• Number of wards covered by the AP ( ward 
rate )
• Service x product bundling 
(serv_prod_bundle )
• Total number of services ( prod_rate )
• Total number of products ( serv_rate )
4. Other characteristics:
• Gender ( AP_gender ),
• Age ( AP_youth )
These variables (highlighted above as they appear in 
the data portal) were used to score all APs and then 
in selection of the APs from the intervention districts 
that would be invited to participate in the incubation 
program. The baseline for APs was, however, 
conducted with all 291 APs in both intervention and 
control districts.

Each AP was scored on each criterion as summarized 
in T able 1, with a summation of scores across criteria 
yielding the AP selection score. This resulted in scores 
ranging from -4 to 5 with a score of 5 indicating high/
advanced level of business operation. T able 2 below 
shows how the APs were distributed across scores.T able 2: Distribution of APs by selection scores and intervention

About 50 out of the 193 APs in intervention districts 
were targeted for selection into the incubation program 
(a longer list of 60 per group was initially generated to 
allow for non-responses following a consent process). To 
ensure that APs of different business levels were selected 
while also targeting youth and women entrepreneurs, 
the targeted 60 APs were distributed across the different 
scores as shown in T able 3. The allocation per score is 
proportionate (approximately 30%)   to each score’ s 
representation in the distribution of the 193 APs in the 
intervention districts.

Given the foregoing, in March 2021, the CGIAR Research 
Program on Livestock (CRP Livestock) technology flagships 
comprising inputs/services groups (Animal Health, Feeds 
& Forages, and Genetics) were guided to use the data to 
select APs in the intervention  group who they thought 
would benefit from the incubation program and achieve 
improved inputs/services and project goals based on a 
given criterion developed from analysis of the scoping 
data. This was done mainly to ensure that selected APs 
cut across different business levels and avoided deliberate 
bias towards including women and youth.

|       Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in TanzaniaDuring the visit to the wards, a list of non-cooperative 
HHs keeping dairy cattle was also compiled and 
combined with the list of cooperative members to 
generate a comprehensive list of dairy HHs in the wards. 
Finally , dairy HHs in the selected wards were selected 
(including non-cooperative members where possible) 
and surveyed. These dairy HHs represent the target HH-
level population for the project.
Results 
T able 4 shows how APs offered for selection are 
distributed across the scores. The aim was to ensure 
that selected APs as per the Livestock CRP flagships cut 
across different business levels, adhering to the women 
and youth representation as indicated. We targeted 
having about 50 APs for incubation, with an additional 10 
APs to start with in case of dropouts or lack of willingness 
to participate. 
T able 5 summarizes the selection of APs by district, 
including additional APs in case of dropouts or 
unwillingness to participate in incubation. It shows the 
distribution of the 60 APs across the different scores of 
levels of the business scale. The 60 APs were invited to 
participate. Finally , 50 participated in the incubation 
process including visioning, boot camp, mentoring and 
coaching.

The HH survey interviewed 713 HHs from 24 wards 
(12 intervention and 12 control) where there were 
cooperative and non-cooperative HHs (in some cases 
we could not get the non-cooperative or the cooperative 
members). The distribution of HHs by ward and district is 
shown in T able 6.

After identification of matched APs in both intervention 
and control areas, the POs/cooperatives linked to them 
were listed. If not already obtained, data on cooperative 
members and their wards was collected. Wards were 
identified around the POs/cooperatives that represent 
common areas of both APs’ coverage and POs/
cooperative members. It is useful to note that not all APs 
were expected to be linked to these POs/cooperatives, 
but the majority are expected to be linked. Those not 
linked are likely working in the same geographical areas. 
These wards of overlap between PO membership and 
AP operation formed the longer list of wards, from 
which a random selection of survey wards was drawn. 
The wards had to have at least eight APs who indicated 
they work in them or at least one PO operating in the 
area (three wards in Rombo were excluded because 
there were no reported POs covering the areas). These 
became project implementation areas. The number of 
wards was balanced according to the HH-level sample 
size calculations during analysis (see below).

ilri.orgDiscussion and next steps
Designing and conducting a social experiment like this 
one presented here is complex given the many factors 
that need to be considered. The complexities will need 
to be factored into the analysis as much as possible 
following an end-line survey . At a basic level, the analysis 
would include measuring the effect of the Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of technology 
package or a combination given the expectation that 
different APs will take up different baskets of interventions 
and that in control areas, APs may have single or 
combination of interventions which may or may not be 
the same. Similarly , there are APs in the intervention areas 
(but not with the project) who may have the same or 
other single or combination interventions and through 
the project may also receive information from their fellow 
project agripreneurs. 
The analysis will also need to consider the likelihood that 
we likely will be unable to evaluate effectively different 
baskets (or individual) technologies and their effects 
but expect to see quite a lot of variation which may be 
explored to look for trends and comparisons. There 
may also be different technologies in control areas than 
in intervention areas because of the actions of partners 
and/or government extension services. Further, we would need to factor observations of 
non-project agripreneurs in intervention districts to 
evaluate the effect of BDS without the confounding of 
technology . Another potential complication is measuring 
and isolating effects on farmers in intervention areas 
who are reached by other non-project APs that are not 
supported with BDS. It is very likely that we will have HHs 
in the project who indicate in the baseline that they are 
working with APs, but who are not part of the project. 
We will explore these issues while analysing the baseline 
and end-line data to deliberately extract these APs. The 
evaluation will also incorporate the parallel qualitative 
assessment of outcomes being conducted separately .

Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs 
and linked households for testing 
delivery of bundled technology packages 
in Tanzania  
James Rao, Immaculate Omondi, Jane Poole and Amos Omore
Key messages
• Designing and conducting the selection of 
agripreneurs and households to test delivery of 
bundled technology packages is complex given the 
many factors that need to be considered.
• Statistical matching technique was used to select 
agripreneurs (APs) and consequently leading to the 
identification of households that were likely to be 
linked to the APs and to producer organizations 
where the APs operated.
• The complexities of the selection of APs and 
households should be factored into the analysis 
as much as possible following an endline survey 
to include measuring the effect of Business 
Development Services (BDS) vs. the effect of a 
technology package or a combination because 
different agripreneurs take up different baskets of 
interventions in different areas.Introduction
Maziwa Zaidi partners identified a set of integrated 
intervention packages (Omore et al. 2019) to be 
tested and delivered as part of the implementation 
of the project on ‘Agri-entrepreneurship, technology 
uptake and inclusive dairy development in T anzania.’ 
The testing and delivery were through empowered 
and appropriately skilled agripreneurs (APs) who were 
expected to also profit from promoting the uptake of the 
prioritized technology packages by smallholder dairy 
farmers linked to them. 
To achieve this aim, the capacity of the APs would be 
strengthened in selected agribusiness knowledge 
areas and skills by incubation service providers. This 
intervention included gender-responsive incubation, 
acceleration, training and mentoring of APs engaged 
in the provision of inputs and services in project sites.

|       Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in TanzaniaFollowing the capacity building, changes in behaviour 
among APs in relation to the delivery of services would 
be monitored in both intervention and control districts 
and wards qualitatively and quantitatively . Qualitative 
monitoring of outcomes would be conducted through 
knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) analysis 
guided by a theory of change developed at the onset. 
Quantitative monitoring would be done through 
baseline and endline surveys of APs and households  
to capture changes in the use of inputs and services by 
HHs linked to the capacitated APs.
This research brief summarizes 1) the methodology 
including the process of selecting APs and HHs and 
2) the results of the selection process. The selection 
process is summarized based on the baseline data 
available at this portal: Maziwa Zaidi/More Milk in 
T anzania (phase II) - Datasets - ILRI Datasets Portal .
 
This intervention included gender-responsive 
incubation, acceleration, training and mentoring of 
the agripreneurs engaged in the provision of inputs 
and services in project sites. The project sites were 
selected based on the need to align with ongoing 
development projects that could facilitate the 
uptake of technology packages  in Kilimanjaro and 
T anga regions of T anzania .
Methodology
Two regions, namely Kilimanjaro and T anga and 
four districts within them (Hai, Siha, Korogwe and 
Muheza) were selected based on the need to align 
with ongoing development projects that could 
facilitate the uptake of technology packages. Within 
each intervention, districts are wards with cattle 
keepers linked to the APs. The selected wards 
are geographically clustered around producer 
organizations (POs) also linked to the APs. Two 
control districts (Moshi Rural and Rombo) with similar 
production and market systems were also identified, 
both in the Kilimanjaro region. Project wards were 
identified by the overlap between the geographical 
catchment of cooperatives/POs and the geographical 
areas from where the project selected APs to draw 
their clients. From these overlapping areas, a random 
selection of wards was made. These are the project 
implementation areas. The selection of APs and HHs 
was carried out in three stages: scoping, selection of 
APs and identification of target HHs (Figure 1).Figure 1: Sampling of agripreneurs and households in treatment and 
control districts.
Stage 1: Scoping  
A scoping exercise was done in October and November 
2020 across the six districts to generate an initial long list 
of all APs in project sites and their networks, including 
the POs/cooperatives that they work with. Sampling 
was informed by the need to have enough to cover 
the diversity of APs and have a sufficiently long list from 
which to select about 50 APs across certain criteria in 
both intervention and control areas. The scoping relied 
on key informant interviews and a snowballing approach 
to generate the long list. 
A total of 57 key informants (mainly ward extension 
officers) and 51 respondents from POs were interviewed, 
through partners in the project implementation area. An 
expanded list of APs was generated from the interviews 
and further snowballed to identify all the APs in the project 
implementation site. This was done by first interviewing 
the identified informants and respondents, to generate 
information on APs in the area, then interviewing all the 
identified APs from the snowball sampling interviews.
 
From the 57 key informants and 51 respondents from 
POs, names of APs operating in the study sites were 
obtained and further names were generated from 
interviewing each of the identified APs from the list. This 
snowball sampling process generated a list of 427 APs. 
Out of this list, the goal was to interview all the listed APs 
who operated within the project implementation areas. 
Since the broader list contained some APs who operated 
outside the area and some who were unavailable due 
to changing their area of operation or other reasons, in 
total, 291 APs were interviewed.
The survey , using a structured survey tool, collected 
minimum data for characterizing these agripreneurs. Data 
on type of enterprises, gender of the entrepreneur, area 
of operation, products and services offered and training 
needs, was obtained. The data generated from the 
scoping survey was used to inform the second stage of 
the selection of those who would be invited to participate 
in the intervention or be part of the control group.

Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in Tanzania           |Stage 2: Selection of agripreneurs  
Initial data from the scoping study was used for the 
selection of intervention APs. The 291 APs were first 
scored based on the criteria listed below, including 
abbreviations in the data portal.
1. Type of business and level of bundling (breeding, 
animal health, agro-dealer, feed supplier, etc.)
2. Linkages that APs have with POs/cooperatives or 
overlap between the PO and AP at the ward level 
(AP_PO_overlap)
3. Scale of operation – clientele and the geographical 
location of most of their clients: 
• Number of wards covered by the AP ( ward 
rate )
• Service x product bundling 
(serv_prod_bundle )
• Total number of services ( prod_rate )
• Total number of products ( serv_rate )
4. Other characteristics:
• Gender ( AP_gender ),
• Age ( AP_youth )
These variables (highlighted above as they appear in 
the data portal) were used to score all APs and then 
in selection of the APs from the intervention districts 
that would be invited to participate in the incubation 
program. The baseline for APs was, however, 
conducted with all 291 APs in both intervention and 
control districts.

Each AP was scored on each criterion as summarized 
in T able 1, with a summation of scores across criteria 
yielding the AP selection score. This resulted in scores 
ranging from -4 to 5 with a score of 5 indicating high/
advanced level of business operation. T able 2 below 
shows how the APs were distributed across scores.T able 2: Distribution of APs by selection scores and intervention

About 50 out of the 193 APs in intervention districts 
were targeted for selection into the incubation program 
(a longer list of 60 per group was initially generated to 
allow for non-responses following a consent process). To 
ensure that APs of different business levels were selected 
while also targeting youth and women entrepreneurs, 
the targeted 60 APs were distributed across the different 
scores as shown in T able 3. The allocation per score is 
proportionate (approximately 30%)   to each score’ s 
representation in the distribution of the 193 APs in the 
intervention districts.

Given the foregoing, in March 2021, the CGIAR Research 
Program on Livestock (CRP Livestock) technology flagships 
comprising inputs/services groups (Animal Health, Feeds 
& Forages, and Genetics) were guided to use the data to 
select APs in the intervention  group who they thought 
would benefit from the incubation program and achieve 
improved inputs/services and project goals based on a 
given criterion developed from analysis of the scoping 
data. This was done mainly to ensure that selected APs 
cut across different business levels and avoided deliberate 
bias towards including women and youth.

|       Maziwa Zaidi: Selection of agripreneurs and linked households for testing delivery of bundled technology packages in TanzaniaDuring the visit to the wards, a list of non-cooperative 
HHs keeping dairy cattle was also compiled and 
combined with the list of cooperative members to 
generate a comprehensive list of dairy HHs in the wards. 
Finally , dairy HHs in the selected wards were selected 
(including non-cooperative members where possible) 
and surveyed. These dairy HHs represent the target HH-
level population for the project.
Results 
T able 4 shows how APs offered for selection are 
distributed across the scores. The aim was to ensure 
that selected APs as per the Livestock CRP flagships cut 
across different business levels, adhering to the women 
and youth representation as indicated. We targeted 
having about 50 APs for incubation, with an additional 10 
APs to start with in case of dropouts or lack of willingness 
to participate. 
T able 5 summarizes the selection of APs by district, 
including additional APs in case of dropouts or 
unwillingness to participate in incubation. It shows the 
distribution of the 60 APs across the different scores of 
levels of the business scale. The 60 APs were invited to 
participate. Finally , 50 participated in the incubation 
process including visioning, boot camp, mentoring and 
coaching.

The HH survey interviewed 713 HHs from 24 wards 
(12 intervention and 12 control) where there were 
cooperative and non-cooperative HHs (in some cases 
we could not get the non-cooperative or the cooperative 
members). The distribution of HHs by ward and district is

After identification of matched APs in both intervention 
and control areas, the POs/cooperatives linked to them 
were listed. If not already obtained, data on cooperative 
members and their wards was collected. Wards were 
identified around the POs/cooperatives that represent 
common areas of both APs’ coverage and POs/
cooperative members. It is useful to note that not all APs 
were expected to be linked to these POs/cooperatives, 
but the majority are expected to be linked. Those not 
linked are likely working in the same geographical areas. 
These wards of overlap between PO membership and 
AP operation formed the longer list of wards, from 
which a random selection of survey wards was drawn. 
The wards had to have at least eight APs who indicated 
they work in them or at least one PO operating in the 
area (three wards in Rombo were excluded because 
there were no reported POs covering the areas). These 
became project implementation areas. The number of 
wards was balanced according to the HH-level sample 
size calculations during analysis (see below).

The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

"5569","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

"5840","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

managed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Digital Tools regional work 
in Vietnam focused on research and engagement with digital tools for technical advice and performance 
assessment in sustainable rice production in the Mekong River Delta due to the high climate change 
impacts, climate change mitigation potentials and sustainability challenges.  
Methodology  
This report focused on the learnings from 2 field studies. The first conducted in September 2022 in Can 
Tho province in the Mekong Delta with 24 farmers and extension agents. The digital tool tested was a 
prototype created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for 
rice farmers. The second conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta on SRP farming 
practices and digital tool use. Data was collected in March 2023, through FGDs with 20 farmers and 5 
field agents. The digital tool tested was a prototype created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is 
designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of GHG emissions.   
The purpose of the FGDs was to: 
 Discuss the support that farmers receive in terms of sources of information/guidance and 
performance assessment in rice production. 
 Discuss how farmers use digital tools to improve, monitor, and evaluate their SRP farming practices.

Farmers’ agroecology practices and sources of technical advice/performance 
assessment 
Non-contracted farmers cultivate rice in three cropping seasons thus, they do not cultivate other crops 
besides rice. They want to decrease to two rice cropping seasons since there is limited profit. It will 
require local government support to convert from three cropping seasons to two cropping seasons. 
Some contracted farmers diversify to other crops besides rice in order to increase their income. They 
cultivate fruit trees like durian, jackfruit, and longan in Thoi Lai and Co Do districts.   
Farmers use a number of methods to improve input use efficiency. This includes the use of the Three 
Reductions, Three Gains (3R3G) approach and One Must Do, 5 Reductions (1M5R) which are both 
government programmes to decrease seed, fertilizer, and pesticide input use. Contracted farmers plant 
their rice based on the recommended schedule of the local government. They use sowing with drum 
seeders or mechanized transplanting, spraying is done by drone, and they use a combine harvester to 
harvest the crop. They also implement ecological engineering for pest management in rice crops such as 
planting nectar-rich flower plants on the bunds surrounding rice fields. They apply the alternate wetting 
and drying (AWD) technique for water management and monitor the water level using water tubes. The 
contracting companies require farmers to use high-quality certified seeds, reduce fertilizers and 
pesticides, refrain from pumping water into fields, and use pesticides 20 days before harvest. The 
application of new measures/technologies are done in agreement with the company and the company 
provides training for farmers. The contracted companies pay an additional 200 VND/kg for rice. 
Contracted farmers access information through training courses, demonstration models, field visits from 
extension staff, television, communications via Zalo, Facebook (i.e. to inform each other in case of pests 
or diseases), Agricultural forecast bulletin (CIAT), MobiAgri application, and previous experiences. 
Non-contracted farmers are beginning to use improved methodologies. They use a reduced seed rate 
with 10-15kg/1300m2 (around 80-120kg/ha). They also use certified seeds, reduce chemical fertilisers 
and increase use of organic fertilizers. They are also reducing the number of seasonal pesticide sprayings 
from 5-6 times to 2-3 times as well as not using pesticides during the first 40 days after sowing. They are 
influenced by market requirements, application of new technologies by neighbouring farmers, concerns 
Page 9:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 for environmental impacts, and their desire to reduce input costs. They receive most of the technical 
advice through demonstration models, training classes, television, and talking with other farmers. 
In general, farmers find local agricultural field agents and company field agents the most reliable sources 
of information, followed by experienced fellow farmers and rice buyers. The preferred methods of 
advisory include regular field visits and face-to-face meetings where field agents are able to observe the 
field and provide accurate responses. Farmers and field agents usually use instant messaging methods 
such as Zalo for exchanging of information. Official weekly reports are made in written form. 
Testing of Agritask mobile application 
The digital tool tested during the first field testing in Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta was a prototype 
created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for rice farmers. 
The system is designed for use by both men and women. It is expected to improve efficiency in the data 
collection process whilst simplifying the process for farmers and reducing errors. With time, it is hoped 
that the tool will be used for SRP certification. The current business model is designed on the 
mechanism of paying farmers to use, since rice farmers do not display a strong desire to use digital tools 
to facilitate the data collection process. Farmers expect that this process should be facilitated by field 
agents as such, it will be important for Agritask to think about whether there is scalability in this 
approach. A more scalable approach would be to target field agents as the end users and as such 
developing a tool suitable for their needs. 
The farmers and field agents considered the Agritask application to be useful for the recording of 
farming practices and a more convenient approach than using pen and paper recording. The information 
is structured well and arranged logically. It is considered to have generally user-friendly interfaces. The 
pest and disease recommendations are useful and there are calculations of cost and profit, enabling 
comparison between seasons. 
Suggestions for improvement 
It was considered very important that farmers are able to extract and share the data that they have 
entered. There were a number of recommendations to reduce the rate of errors. It was recommended 
to allow farmers to edit data retrospectively in case of errors while recording. Allowing duplication of 
records where practices do not change over time can reduce errors for example, area or type and 
Page 10:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 volume of pesticides. Duplication of some entry points can also save a significant amount of time. It was 
suggested that a reminder warning be included if a user forgets to input data (according to an 
established frequency such as daily or weekly or a few times per week) similarly pest/disease warning 
were considered to be useful. Award points could encourage farmers to use frequently. 
Some more specific recommendations are: 
 Use of digit separators (. ,) 
 Charts of farming results (cost, yield, revenue, profit, etc.) to compare with the same season across 
different years. 
 The app currently does not allow saving data for the current day. It only allows saving for dates up 
to the date before the current date. Sometimes farmers use lunar calendar for crop establishment, 
it would be good if the app can show both lunar and solar calendars. 
 Machinery cost should be broken down to specific items such as land preparation, tillage/ploughing, 
sowing, etc.  
 Allow users to add items not available in the pre-designed lists of fertilisers and pesticides (some 
common fertilisers such as urea, DAP, Kali NPK 16-16-8, NPK 20-20-15 are not in the list). Under pest 
management: mouse management is missing. 
 Labour cost can be VND/day and can sometimes be a lump sum cost (not determined by labour 
day), so the app should allow to record labour cost by area (i.e. ha or season). 
 The area unit varies between provinces. While farmers in one province are familiar with ha, those in 
other provinces are more familiar with “big cong” (equivalent to 1296m2). 
 Farmers are confused among units of fertilizer (the way of inputting is not friendly to them) and the 
units for pesticide were too limiting. Some people would prefer litres, while others prefer bottles or 
other units.  
 The app’s error alerts were confusing to farmers, sometimes the alerts were in English even though 
the device system language and the app language were both in Vietnamese.

SRP management 
Rikolto launched their SRP project in Dong Thap 2018 with implementation of the model commencing at 
the end of 2019. By 2020, the program had been scaled up to involve approximately 800 small holder 
farmers across eight cooperatives, covering a total of 2,000-3,000 hectares of land. 
Scoring occurs once per crop season, typically at the end of the season. Agents visit farmers weekly to 
monitor progress, assess the current situation, and take notes for a summary report. The process to 
input farming data for SRP monitoring and scoring takes approximately two hours per SRP farmer. At the 
time of survey, SRP scoring was done by technicians in the local areas who had been trained in SRP in 
cooperation with the cooperatives; most farmers who joined this program reached 80% and above. 
There was a plan that Rikolto would hire an independent body to perform the scoring in 2023 with the 
expectation of selling rice at a higher price. 
Agents maintain records of each SRP farmer's name, rice area, field address, and phone number on hard 
copy documents. The SRP project provides agents an Excel form for scoring. SRP farmers keep record of 
farming diaries using a notebook provided by the project. The rice management diary includes 
information on seed varieties, fertilizer usage, harvesting practices, labour costs, yields, prices, and 
productivity. At the end of the season, these diaries are collected by field agents to input into a digital 
format (normally Excel) for scoring.  
It was reported that production cost reduced up to 30% per season. Currently, there is no contract 
farming scheme for SRP rice under this project. Farmers sell rice either to companies under the 
cooperatives’ on-going contracts or to middlemen. SRP rice under this project is sold at prices that are 
100-200 VND/kg higher than market prices for regular rice; the difference comes from negotiation based 
on improved quality (i.e., use of certified seeds and reduced chemical use). Some farmers indicated that 
after completing the pilot project, they would continue to implement the SRP techniques due to the 
financial benefits from saving input costs and health benefits for farmers. Some farmers shared that 
they would continue the model if the rice is certified and sold at considerably higher prices.

 In general, all famers apply AWD. Even during the wet season (Autumn – Winter), sometimes water is 
pumped out of the field to prevent logging. Farms use certified pesticides and apply integrated pest 
management practices to control pesticide use. Straw is generally incorporated before wet seasons and 
collected and sold during dry seasons. Straw is sold for production of mushroom, ornamental plants and 
flowers or compost.

Challenges faced by field agents while using digital tools  
Data is collected by field agents in pen and paper form in the field. When the agents return to their 
office this data is transcribed on to Excel. The software does not have all the statistical functions 
needed, and agents must use additional software like SPSS for further analysis. Additionally, it takes 
time to enter information from the notebook to Excel while doing SRP scoring. 
Communication tools such as Zalo are commonly used by field agents to communicate with farmers. 
Google maps is sometimes used by field agents however, it doesn’t meet the resolution needs to meet 
the requirements of users/officers in monitoring rice growth stages and pest detection. 
Field agents expressed an interest in using an app and transferring the notebook/diary to manage online 
by an application to save time, ensure consistency, and provide convenience. There was the suggestion 
of integrating the scoring function into the app so that farmers can enter data themselves under the 
support of field agents.  
Testing of CropPal mobile application 
The second field testing conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta tested a prototype 
created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of 
Page 13:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 GHG emissions. They are still in the process of developing a sustainable business model. They are 
proposing the app be pay for use by farmers or supported by financial institutions. It will be important to 
develop a long term scalable business model. One approach could be to design the app for use by public 
sector and private sector field agents, who work directly with farmers for SRP certification.  
Field agents considered CropPal to be generally convenient, accessible, and suitable for users/farmers. 
They liked the ability of CropPal to retain information.  It was suggested that a reminder warning be 
included for incomplete information in each section and there be a function to review the history of 
entered information. It was requested that there be a function to export outputs to Excel. It was 
proposed the design of a season management section by year. 
Interface 
Farmers struggled to interpret the icons. It was suggested that changing the icons to text or 
photographic images that are familiar to farmers which would make the buttons more easily 
recognisable. Farmers also preferred to have each button in its own distinctive colour. Vietnamese 
needs to be used as the primary language throughout the app. 
Field agents had a preference for use of kg unit instead of “bag” unit. Field agents suggested changing 
from drop down options to a blank space which allows flexibility of answer. List all fertilizer categories 
and leave the corresponding quantity blank for users. They suggested changing the way to log in to 
CropPal, using the user's phone number to get the number code automatically, which is only required 
the first time using the app. The app could then be managed by the field agents using farmer code. 
Functions 
It was recommended that the application include more statistical functions on varieties e.g. variety type, 
quantity/area of sowing). They would like additional functions for productivity and information about 
expenses for fertilizers, and labour costs. The definition of the duration of each rice variety should be 
adjusted as follows: Short-term rice (85-90 days), medium-term rice (95 days), long-term rice (>110 
days). Pest detection time needs to be included (dd/mm)

 Introduction  
Background 
This report summarizes findings from the project “Agroecological transitions for building resilient and 
inclusive agricultural and food systems (TRANSITIONS)” which is funded by the European Commission 
through its Development of Smart Innovation through Research in Agriculture (DeSIRA) initiative and 
managed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Digital Tools regional work 
in Vietnam focused on research and engagement with digital tools for technical advice and performance 
assessment in sustainable rice production in the Mekong River Delta due to the high climate change 
impacts, climate change mitigation potentials and sustainability challenges.  
Methodology  
This report focused on the learnings from 2 field studies. The first conducted in September 2022 in Can 
Tho province in the Mekong Delta with 24 farmers and extension agents. The digital tool tested was a 
prototype created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for 
rice farmers. The second conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta on SRP farming 
practices and digital tool use. Data was collected in March 2023, through FGDs with 20 farmers and 5 
field agents. The digital tool tested was a prototype created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is 
designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of GHG emissions.   
The purpose of the FGDs was to: 
 Discuss the support that farmers receive in terms of sources of information/guidance and 
performance assessment in rice production.

Farmers’ agroecology practices and sources of technical advice/performance 
assessment 
Non-contracted farmers cultivate rice in three cropping seasons thus, they do not cultivate other crops 
besides rice. They want to decrease to two rice cropping seasons since there is limited profit. It will 
require local government support to convert from three cropping seasons to two cropping seasons. 
Some contracted farmers diversify to other crops besides rice in order to increase their income. They 
cultivate fruit trees like durian, jackfruit, and longan in Thoi Lai and Co Do districts.   
Farmers use a number of methods to improve input use efficiency. This includes the use of the Three 
Reductions, Three Gains (3R3G) approach and One Must Do, 5 Reductions (1M5R) which are both 
government programmes to decrease seed, fertilizer, and pesticide input use. Contracted farmers plant 
their rice based on the recommended schedule of the local government. They use sowing with drum 
seeders or mechanized transplanting, spraying is done by drone, and they use a combine harvester to 
harvest the crop. They also implement ecological engineering for pest management in rice crops such as 
planting nectar-rich flower plants on the bunds surrounding rice fields. They apply the alternate wetting 
and drying (AWD) technique for water management and monitor the water level using water tubes. The 
contracting companies require farmers to use high-quality certified seeds, reduce fertilizers and 
pesticides, refrain from pumping water into fields, and use pesticides 20 days before harvest. The 
application of new measures/technologies are done in agreement with the company and the company 
provides training for farmers. The contracted companies pay an additional 200 VND/kg for rice. 
Contracted farmers access information through training courses, demonstration models, field visits from 
extension staff, television, communications via Zalo, Facebook (i.e. to inform each other in case of pests 
or diseases), Agricultural forecast bulletin (CIAT), MobiAgri application, and previous experiences. 
Non-contracted farmers are beginning to use improved methodologies. They use a reduced seed rate 
with 10-15kg/1300m2 (around 80-120kg/ha). They also use certified seeds, reduce chemical fertilisers 
and increase use of organic fertilizers. They are also reducing the number of seasonal pesticide sprayings 
from 5-6 times to 2-3 times as well as not using pesticides during the first 40 days after sowing. They are 
influenced by market requirements, application of new technologies by neighbouring farmers, concerns 
Page 9:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 for environmental impacts, and their desire to reduce input costs. They receive most of the technical 
advice through demonstration models, training classes, television, and talking with other farmers. 
In general, farmers find local agricultural field agents and company field agents the most reliable sources 
of information, followed by experienced fellow farmers and rice buyers. The preferred methods of 
advisory include regular field visits and face-to-face meetings where field agents are able to observe the 
field and provide accurate responses. Farmers and field agents usually use instant messaging methods 
such as Zalo for exchanging of information. Official weekly reports are made in written form. 
Testing of Agritask mobile application 
The digital tool tested during the first field testing in Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta was a prototype 
created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for rice farmers. 
The system is designed for use by both men and women. It is expected to improve efficiency in the data 
collection process whilst simplifying the process for farmers and reducing errors. With time, it is hoped 
that the tool will be used for SRP certification. The current business model is designed on the 
mechanism of paying farmers to use, since rice farmers do not display a strong desire to use digital tools 
to facilitate the data collection process. Farmers expect that this process should be facilitated by field 
agents as such, it will be important for Agritask to think about whether there is scalability in this 
approach. A more scalable approach would be to target field agents as the end users and as such 
developing a tool suitable for their needs. 
The farmers and field agents considered the Agritask application to be useful for the recording of 
farming practices and a more convenient approach than using pen and paper recording. The information 
is structured well and arranged logically. It is considered to have generally user-friendly interfaces. The 
pest and disease recommendations are useful and there are calculations of cost and profit, enabling 
comparison between seasons. 
Suggestions for improvement 
It was considered very important that farmers are able to extract and share the data that they have 
entered. There were a number of recommendations to reduce the rate of errors. It was recommended 
to allow farmers to edit data retrospectively in case of errors while recording. Allowing duplication of 
records where practices do not change over time can reduce errors for example, area or type and 
Page 10:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 volume of pesticides. Duplication of some entry points can also save a significant amount of time. It was 
suggested that a reminder warning be included if a user forgets to input data (according to an 
established frequency such as daily or weekly or a few times per week) similarly pest/disease warning 
were considered to be useful. Award points could encourage farmers to use frequently. 
Some more specific recommendations are: 
 Use of digit separators (. ,) 
 Charts of farming results (cost, yield, revenue, profit, etc.) to compare with the same season across 
different years. 
 The app currently does not allow saving data for the current day. It only allows saving for dates up 
to the date before the current date. Sometimes farmers use lunar calendar for crop establishment, 
it would be good if the app can show both lunar and solar calendars. 
 Machinery cost should be broken down to specific items such as land preparation, tillage/ploughing, 
sowing, etc.  
 Allow users to add items not available in the pre-designed lists of fertilisers and pesticides (some 
common fertilisers such as urea, DAP, Kali NPK 16-16-8, NPK 20-20-15 are not in the list). Under pest 
management: mouse management is missing. 
 Labour cost can be VND/day and can sometimes be a lump sum cost (not determined by labour 
day), so the app should allow to record labour cost by area (i.e. ha or season). 
 The area unit varies between provinces. While farmers in one province are familiar with ha, those in 
other provinces are more familiar with “big cong” (equivalent to 1296m2). 
 Farmers are confused among units of fertilizer (the way of inputting is not friendly to them) and the 
units for pesticide were too limiting. Some people would prefer litres, while others prefer bottles or 
other units.  
 The app’s error alerts were confusing to farmers, sometimes the alerts were in English even though 
the device system language and the app language were both in Vietnamese.

SRP management 
Rikolto launched their SRP project in Dong Thap 2018 with implementation of the model commencing at 
the end of 2019. By 2020, the program had been scaled up to involve approximately 800 small holder 
farmers across eight cooperatives, covering a total of 2,000-3,000 hectares of land. 
Scoring occurs once per crop season, typically at the end of the season. Agents visit farmers weekly to 
monitor progress, assess the current situation, and take notes for a summary report. The process to 
input farming data for SRP monitoring and scoring takes approximately two hours per SRP farmer. At the 
time of survey, SRP scoring was done by technicians in the local areas who had been trained in SRP in 
cooperation with the cooperatives; most farmers who joined this program reached 80% and above. 
There was a plan that Rikolto would hire an independent body to perform the scoring in 2023 with the 
expectation of selling rice at a higher price. 
Agents maintain records of each SRP farmer's name, rice area, field address, and phone number on hard 
copy documents. The SRP project provides agents an Excel form for scoring. SRP farmers keep record of 
farming diaries using a notebook provided by the project. The rice management diary includes 
information on seed varieties, fertilizer usage, harvesting practices, labour costs, yields, prices, and 
productivity. At the end of the season, these diaries are collected by field agents to input into a digital 
format (normally Excel) for scoring.  
It was reported that production cost reduced up to 30% per season. Currently, there is no contract 
farming scheme for SRP rice under this project. Farmers sell rice either to companies under the 
cooperatives’ on-going contracts or to middlemen. SRP rice under this project is sold at prices that are 
100-200 VND/kg higher than market prices for regular rice; the difference comes from negotiation based 
on improved quality (i.e., use of certified seeds and reduced chemical use). Some farmers indicated that 
after completing the pilot project, they would continue to implement the SRP techniques due to the 
financial benefits from saving input costs and health benefits for farmers. Some farmers shared that 
they would continue the model if the rice is certified and sold at considerably higher prices.

 In general, all famers apply AWD. Even during the wet season (Autumn – Winter), sometimes water is 
pumped out of the field to prevent logging. Farms use certified pesticides and apply integrated pest 
management practices to control pesticide use. Straw is generally incorporated before wet seasons and 
collected and sold during dry seasons. Straw is sold for production of mushroom, ornamental plants and 
flowers or compost.

Challenges faced by field agents while using digital tools  
Data is collected by field agents in pen and paper form in the field. When the agents return to their 
office this data is transcribed on to Excel. The software does not have all the statistical functions 
needed, and agents must use additional software like SPSS for further analysis. Additionally, it takes 
time to enter information from the notebook to Excel while doing SRP scoring. 
Communication tools such as Zalo are commonly used by field agents to communicate with farmers. 
Google maps is sometimes used by field agents however, it doesn’t meet the resolution needs to meet 
the requirements of users/officers in monitoring rice growth stages and pest detection. 
Field agents expressed an interest in using an app and transferring the notebook/diary to manage online 
by an application to save time, ensure consistency, and provide convenience. There was the suggestion 
of integrating the scoring function into the app so that farmers can enter data themselves under the 
support of field agents.  
Testing of CropPal mobile application 
The second field testing conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta tested a prototype 
created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of 
Page 13:

 GHG emissions. They are still in the process of developing a sustainable business model. They are 
proposing the app be pay for use by farmers or supported by financial institutions. It will be important to 
develop a long term scalable business model. One approach could be to design the app for use by public 
sector and private sector field agents, who work directly with farmers for SRP certification.  
Field agents considered CropPal to be generally convenient, accessible, and suitable for users/farmers. 
They liked the ability of CropPal to retain information.  It was suggested that a reminder warning be 
included for incomplete information in each section and there be a function to review the history of 
entered information. It was requested that there be a function to export outputs to Excel. It was 
proposed the design of a season management section by year. 
Interface 
Farmers struggled to interpret the icons. It was suggested that changing the icons to text or 
photographic images that are familiar to farmers which would make the buttons more easily 
recognisable. Farmers also preferred to have each button in its own distinctive colour. Vietnamese 
needs to be used as the primary language throughout the app. 
Field agents had a preference for use of kg unit instead of “bag” unit. Field agents suggested changing 
from drop down options to a blank space which allows flexibility of answer. List all fertilizer categories 
and leave the corresponding quantity blank for users. They suggested changing the way to log in to 
CropPal, using the user's phone number to get the number code automatically, which is only required 
the first time using the app. The app could then be managed by the field agents using farmer code. 
Functions 
It was recommended that the application include more statistical functions on varieties e.g. variety type, 
quantity/area of sowing). They would like additional functions for productivity and information about 
expenses for fertilizers, and labour costs. The definition of the duration of each rice variety should be 
adjusted as follows: Short-term rice (85-90 days), medium-term rice (95 days), long-term rice (>110 
days). Pest detection time needs to be included (dd/mm)

"6253","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

Conservation agriculture for regenerating soil health and climate change mitigation in smallholder systems of South Asia The increase in agriculture production to meet the food demand of growing human population from a limited availability of arable land with low environmental footprints and preserving natural resources (soil, water and air) simultaneously are major challenges in South Asia. The situation is further complicated by the climate change, which will further lower the food production, compounding the challenge of meeting food demand. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is solution to several challenges being faced in farming such as soil health, climate change, water scarcity, agricultural pollution, farm profitability, human health, etc. This exhaustive review examines the published literature from South Asia to assess the impact of CA on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the subsequent impacts on soil health (physical, chemical and biological properties), C sequestration and greenhouse gases emissions in major cropping systems. The results from several studies demonstrated that CA increased SOC and improved soil health parameters, mainly in the surface soil layer. The effects of CA on the changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity are small. The CA showed a remarkable positive impact on the nutrient availability in the soil. The CA system helped in both climate change mitigation and adaptation for sustainable crop production. The present gaps in our knowledge in soil health assessment and research agenda to fill the gaps are also included in this chapter. We hope this review of past accomplishments, current activities, and future opportunities will stimulate additional soil health research throughout the 21st century. Chapter Three.

The objectives of this study were to develop a precision SPVD phenotyping protocol, to find new SPVD-resistant genotypes, and to standardize the first stages of screening for SPVD resistance. The first part of the protocol was based on ELISA results for sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and sweet potato virus C (SPVC) with adjustments to a negative control (uninfected clone 'Tanzania') and was performed on a pre-breeding population (VZ08) comprising 455 clones and 27 check clones graft-inoculated under screenhouse conditions. The second part included field studies with 52 selected clones for SPCSV resistance from VZ08 and eight checks. In screenhouse conditions, the resistant and susceptible check clones performed as expected, 63 clones from VZ08 exhibited lower relative absorbance values for SPCSV and SPVC than inoculated check Tanzania. Field experiments confirmed SPVD resistance of several clones selected by relative absorbance values (nine resistant clones in two locations, i.e. 17.3% of the screenhouse selection), supporting the reliability of our method for SPVD-resistance selection. Two clones were promising, exhibiting high storage root yields of 28.7-34.9 t ha-1 and SPVD resistance, based on the proposed selection procedure. This modified serological analysis for SPVD-resistance phenotyping might lead to more efficient development of resistant varieties by reducing costs and time at early stages, and provide solid data for marker assisted selection with a quantitative tool for classifying resistance.

The second part included field studies with 52 selected clones for SPCSV resistance from VZ08 and eight checks. In screenhouse conditions, the resistant and susceptible check clones performed as expected, 63 clones from VZ08 exhibited lower relative absorbance values for SPCSV and SPVC than inoculated check Tanzania. Field experiments confirmed SPVD resistance of several clones selected by relative absorbance values (nine resistant clones in two locations, i.e. 17.3% of the screenhouse selection), supporting the reliability of our method for SPVD-resistance selection. Two clones were promising, exhibiting high storage root yields of 28.7-34.9 t ha-1 and SPVD resistance, based on the proposed selection procedure. This modified serological analysis for SPVD-resistance phenotyping might lead to more efficient development of resistant varieties by reducing costs and time at early stages, and provide solid data for marker assisted selection with a quantitative tool for classifying resistance.

"6328","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

(2023) Aquaculture governance: five engagement arenas for sustainability transformation. Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability 65: 101379.

Concerted governance efforts can help move the sector beyond fragmented technical questions associated with intensification and expansion, social and environmental impacts, and toward system-based approaches that address interconnected sustainability issues. Through a review and expert-elicitation process, we identify five engagement arenas to advance a governance agenda for aquaculture sustainability transformation: (1) setting sustainability transformation goals, (2) cross-sectoral linkages, (3) land–water–sea connectivity, (4) knowledge and innovation, and (5) value chains. We then outline the roles different actors and modes of governance can play in fostering sustainability transformations, and discuss action items for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to operationalize activities within their engagement arenas.

"6588","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

hazard data from livestock farmers' current interactions with agriculture service provider platforms 
like iShamba. The goal is to develop a high -resolution, targeted, and timely advisory package for 
livestock far mers through these platforms. The dataset comprises 319,569 records of text 
messages sent by farmers via the iShamba platform between 2015 and 2022. After data pre -
processing, including filtering for livestock -specific messages and removing duplicate SMS 
messages, the final sample size is 72,062, with no missing data.

The results reveal that simplifying THI and NDD stress level classes did not yield expected 
outcomes, especially when compared to the more intricate model of NDD. The intricate model 
successfully identified stress -related words and SMSs. The findings empha size that extreme

 Introduction  
 
iShamba, part of MediaE company, is a call centre  staffed by agricultural professionals where 
farmers can SMS in their inquiries or phone in for immediate assistance. Along with the weather 
updates and market prices, iShamba offers Agri -tips on crops and livestock after a farmer signs up. 
Farmers can eit her sign up for free or choose a premium plan for a small fee per year.  
Overview  
 
The Climate Action team's Livestock and Climate Initiative project, led by Scientist Dharani Dhar 
Burra, is interested in understanding historical messaging patterns and their correlation with 
climate hazards data from livestock farmers' current interactio ns with agriculture service provider 
platforms like iShamba. This information will further help to develop a high resolution targeted/ 
timely advisory package for livestock farmers through the service provider platforms.  
Objectives  
 
This project will aim to:  
 
1. Understand current trends/patterns of historical interactions of farmers with the iShamba 
platform.  
2. Identify if there is a pattern between messaging from farmers and climate hazards.  
3. We can then estimate farmers information requirements much ahead of time based on the 
forecasted climate hazards.  
4. This pre -emption of information requirement will then help us build more targeted advisory 
packages for the livestock farmers.  
5. Assess the applicability of the targeted advisories sent to the farmers through surveys.  
Data  
 
This project aims to analyze unstructured data from the iShamba platform, specifically text 
messages sent by farmers between the years 2015 to 2022. The initial plan was to utilize two 
years of data, but after preliminary data processing, many cases were d ropped due to incomplete 
or one -word messages received from the farmers, leading to a significant drop in the number of 
observations.         
 
The dataset received from the iShamba platform for the specified years contains 319,569 records. 
However, after data pre -processing and filtering to include only livestock -specific messages, and 
manually deleting duplicate SMS messages, the final sample si ze for this study is 72,062, with no 
missing data in the dataset.   
 
The variables included in the dataset are Task ID, Customer ID, Date, Time, Description, 
SMS sent by farmers, Responses to SMS, Assignees, Priority, SMS Tags, County, Sub - 
County, Wards, and x and y location points. The analysis will focus on the following  
variables:  
 
Page 4:
 
Page. 4  
 • Date - a character variable recorded by the platform for every farmer's inquiry received. The 
year and month will be extracted to calculate climate hazards later in the analysis.  
• SMS sent by farmers - a character variable containing the text messages received by 
farmers on the iShamba platform.  
• Sub-county - a character variable that records the county location of the farmer.  
• Ward - a character variable that records the sub -county location of the farmer.  
 
The number of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) are both recognized to reduce 
the productivity of livestock. However, the Agriculture Adaptation Atlas does not provide the mean 
number of NDD and THI for the years 2015 -2022. Therefore, bo th climate hazards were computed 
monthly for each year and ward using a projected climate hazards model. This will help to develop 
a relationship between the text messages received by farmers and both climate hazards. The 
overall goal of this relationship is to project future advisories that iShamba can send to livestock 
farmers regarding climate hazards at appropriate time in their location.  
 
Methodology  
 
I.Data Pre -Processing  
 
The data pre -processing for this project was conducted using R, due to the unstructured 
nature of the data. The initial step involved the removal of special characters, numbers, 
brackets, and quotes. This was followed by the separation of the time and date into new 
variables to extract the year and month for calculating the mean climate hazards in later 
analysis.  
 
The third step of the pre -processing included trimming the white spaces between text, 
selecting SMS messages that had a character count of 3 or above, and converting all text to 
lowercase. Additionally, some misspelled words in the SMS sent by farmers colu mn were 
corrected to enhance the accuracy of the subsequent analysis.  
 
A total of 140 wards were missing in the dataset, but their location points X and Y were 
available. To obtain the names of these wards, a join was performed with a Kenya shapefile 
dataset using the X and Y location points. This allowed for the extraction of the missing ward 
names, completing the dataset. Finally, records of counties that were not in Kenya and rows 
with ""NA"" across the county, sub -county, ward, and X and Y location points were dropped. The 
resulting p re-processed dataset had 252,759 observations.  
 
II.Filtering data to livestock  
 
To filter the dataset to focus only on livestock -related queries, a text analysis was performed 
using the ""Tm"" package in R to tokenize the SMS messages into words. A total of 264 words 
were removed, including non -English words and common words that were n ot relevant to the 
analysis. This resulted in a list of 81,114 unique words. The tokenized words list was then 
shared with iShamba to identify livestock -related words, which were flagged as ""high,"" while 
words that were not related to livestock were flagged as ""low."" This process yielded a list of 
Page 5:
 
Page. 5  
 5,956 unique words related to livestock. These words were used to filter the text messages to 
only include those that contained one or more words related to livestock.  
 
This filtering process resulted in a dataset of 78,169 observations. However, to eliminate 
duplicate SMS messages, a manual deletion process was conducted, resulting in a reduced 
dataset of 72,062 observations. A join operation was performed by creating a file containing 
unique IDs of sub -counties and wards, which was then merged with the filtered text data.  
 
To compute the monthly NDD and THI values for each ward, the same computation steps 
used for the development of the global adaptation atlas ( AdaptationAtlas - hazards ) were 
applied. The resulting data was aggregated to obtain average values for each month/year and 
ward. These average values were appended to the iShamba dataset, which contained the 
corresponding month, year, and ward for each SMS message.  
 
To facilitate analysis and interpretation, the NDD and THI values were transformed into new 
binary categorical variables as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl: a character variable defined as1: 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress"" = “yes”,  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”.  
 
• ndd_lvl: a character variable defined as:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress"" = “yes”.  
 
Consequently, the final dataset consists of 72,062 observations and includes six variables: 
SMS (actual) by farmers, month, year, ward, thi_lvl, and ndd_lvl. This filtered dataset was 
used for the subsequent analysis.  
 
III.Analysis  
 
Structural Topic Model (STM) provides a variety of statistical approaches for analyzing text 
data. The STM allows one to discover topics and estimate their relationship to document 
metadata. The  “stm” package in R provides tools to facilitate the workflow associated with 
analyzing textual data and users have a broad array of options to process raw text data, 
explore and analyze the data, and present findings using a variety of plotting tools.  
 
The steps involved in the STM topic prevalence model are as follows:  
 
1. Loading the data in R:  The ""stm"" package represents the text corpus in three parts:  
 
• A documents list containing word indices and their associated counts.  
 
1 The iShamba data has no THI “sever stress” cases.  
Page 6:
 
Page. 6  
 • A vocab character vector containing the words associated with the word indices.  
• A metadata matrix containing document covariates.  
 
2. Applying the ""textProcessor"" function:  This function is used to preprocess the data 
by removing punctuation, eliminating stop words, and stemming the words. It leverages 
the ""tm"" package and can be applied across multiple languages.  
 
3. Using the utility function ""prepDocuments"":  This function processes the loaded 
data to ensure it is in the correct format. It can also remove infrequent terms based on 
a user -set parameter called ""lower.thresh."" Additionally, ""prepDocuments""  will re -
index all metadata and document relationships if any changes occur during the 
processing. If a document is completely removed due to preprocessing (e.g., if it 
contained only rare words), the corresponding row in the metadata will be dropped. It i s 
important to inspect the document features and vocabulary list after reading and 
processing the text data to verify that the preprocessing steps have been applied 
correctly . 
 
These steps are crucial for preparing the data for the subsequent stages of the STM topic 
prevalence model. After the data import process in steps 2 and 3, the text corpus includes of 
71,105 documents and 16,467 tokens.  
 
4. Exploration of Topic Model s: Determining the optimal number of topics for a given 
corpus is not a straightforward task (Grimmer and Stewart 2013). To address this 
challenge, the ""searchK""  function employs a data -driven approach to select the 
appropriate number of topics. This function conducts various automated tests, such as 
calculating the held -out likelihood (Wallach et al. 2009) and performing residual 
analysis (Taddy 2012). By default , the ""Spectral""  initialization method is used due to 
its stability. Additionally, the ""searchK""  function computes several informative metrics, 
including average exclusivity and semantic coherence, to assist in the selection 
process.  
 
5. Estimating the structural topic model (STM):  After determining the optimal number 
of topics, the next crucial step is to estimate the STM. This process involves using 
various functions to assess, comprehend, and visualize the fitted model object. One 
key advantage of STM is its ability to incorporat e metadata into the topic modeling 
framework, enhancing the analysis in two ways:  
 
• topical prevalence:  Metadata covariates for topical prevalence enable the 
observed metadata to influence how frequently a topic is discussed.  
• topical content:  Covariates in topical content allow the observed metadata to 
affect the rate of word usage within a specific topic, shaping how that topic is 
discussed.  
 
When running the STM model, multiple arguments will be used, including the output from the 
prepDocuments  () function, which provides a documents column, a vocab column, and a meta 
column. The number of topics (K) identified using the ""searchK"" function will also be specified. 
Additionally, the ""init.type"" will be set to ""Spectral."" Lastly, the ""prevalence"" a rgument will be  
Page 7:
 
Page. 7  
 utilized to specify the metadata variables of interest as covariates, represented as an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and ""ndd_lvl.""  
 
6. Interpreting STM model results:  Once a suitable model has been chosen, the next 
crucial step involves interpreting the results. There are various methods to explore the 
output and gain insights from the STM model. The stm package provides several 
options to investigate and analyse the m odel's outcomes:  
 
• Displaying words associated with Topics : The “labelTopics”  function, along 
with the plot method for 'STM' objects (with the argument type = ""labels""), and the 
“sageLabels”  function (with the plot method for 'STM' objects, using the argument 
type = ""perspectives""), allow users to view the words closely associated with each 
topic. Additionally, the “findThoughts”  and “plotQuote”  functions are useful for 
identifying documents that have strong associations with specific topics.  
• Estimating relationships between Metadata and Topics:  The “estimateEffect”  
function can be employed to estimate the relationships between metadata 
variables and topics, as well as the topical content. This facilitates understanding 
how certain metadata covariates influence the prevalence and content of different 
topics.  
• Calculating Topic Correlations:  To measure the correlations between different 
topics, the “topicCorr”  function can be utilized, providing valuable insights into 
the relationships between various topics within the model.  
 
7. Shiny Application for inspecting STM results:  The “stminsights”  package in R 
enables interactive validation, interpretation, and visualization of one or several 
Structural Topic Models (STM).  
 
8. Stupid Back -off (SBO) model  – The “sbo” package in R will be used using the N -
gram model to build a predictive model that will take space -time stamp  and stress 
conditions to predict the next word(s).  
Results  
 
I.Determining the number of topics  
 
To identify the optimal number of topics for the analysis, the searchK function from the STM 
package in R will be utilized. This function takes several arguments, including the output from 
the prepDocuments() function. The number of topics (K) will be expl ored in the range of 30 to 
100. Additionally, the ""init.type"" parameter will be set to ""Spectral"" to improve the initialization 
process. Furthermore, the ""prevalence"" argument will be specified, allowing for the inclusion of 
metadata variables as covariate s, represented as an interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and 
""ndd_lvl."" This data -driven approach will help determine the most appropriate number of topics 
to be used by comparing the exclusivity and sematic scores between topics in the subsequent 
analysis.  
 
The results presented in Figure A showcase four key metrics used to assess the model 
quality: held -out likelihood, residual dispersion, topic semantic coherence, and the 
Page 8:
 
Page. 8  
 approximation to the lower -bound of the marginal likelihood. The objective is to maximize the 
held-out likelihood, semantic coherence, and lower -bound while minimizing the dispersion of 
residuals. These metrics collectively aid in determining the most reli able and robust model for 
the analysis.  
 
Figure A: Diagnostic Values for STM Model  (Sequence of Topics 30 -100) 
 
 
 
To evaluate the strength of the modelled topics and choose the appropriate number of topics 
for the analysis, we refer to Figure A.1, which displays a comparison of different STM models 
with varying numbers of topics. Models with K = 30 and K = 40 exhibit a narrower spread of 
topics towards the right side, and both models contain some topics that are considered 
outliers. On the other hand, models with K = 80 and K = 90 show a more favorable spread of 
topics towards the right, indicating a better distribution. Among these models, model 90 stands 
out, as it contains numerous topics with high exclusivity and semantic scores, making it the 
most suitable choice for further analysis.

II.Interpreting the STM by plotting and inspecting res ults 
 
After selecting the appropriate model with the desired number of topics, the next crucial step is 
to interpret the results of the STM model. The ""stm"" package offers several functions to 
explore the model's outcomes effectively. One such approach is to examine collections of 
words associated with each topic using the ""labelTopics"" function. Figure A.2 ill ustrates a 
sample output of the STM model, presenting four types of word weightings:  
 
• Highest Probability : This includes words within each topic with the highest probability, 
directly inferred from the topic -word distribution parameter β.  
• FREX:  Words are weighted based on their overall frequency and their exclusivity to the 
topic.  
• Lift: Words are weighted by dividing their frequency in the current topic by their 
frequency in other topics, giving higher weight to words that appear less frequently in 
other topics.  
• Score:  This weighting divides the log frequency of the word in the current topic by the 
log frequency of the word in other topics.  
 
It is advisable to prioritize using FREX words as they highlight words that carry significant 
weight and are unique to each topic. As evident in Figure A.2, Topic 22 is associated with 
farmers seeking information on grazing and breeds through the iShamba p latform, while Topic 
3 and Topic 47 both lack any coherent association with a specific topic. Additionally, Topic 68 
Page 10:
 
Page. 10  
 discusses harvest -related matters, and Topic 83 focuses on farmers seeking advice and 
assistance from the iShamba platform regarding farming activities.  
 
Figure A .2: Example of the output of STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
 
Another valuable approach is to estimate the relationships between metadata and topics using 
the ""estimateEffect""  function. These relationships play a crucial role in validating the topic 
model's effectiveness (Grimmer 2010; Grimmer and Stewart 2013). This function performs 
regression, treating documents as the units, the proportion of each document about a topic in 
an STM model as the outcome, and document metadata as covariates. The method of 
composition is used to incorporate measurement uncertainty from the STM model. The 
""estimateEffect""  function requires several arguments, including the formula representing an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl""  and "" ndd_lvl"",  the output of the STM model, and the metadata. 
The ""uncertainty""  parameter is set to ""Global""  by default, which considers the estimation 
uncertainty of topic proportions in the uncertainty estimates using the method of composition. 
Alternatively, users can choose ""None""  for uncertainty if they do not wish to propagate the full 
amount of uncertainty, which might result in narrower confidence intervals due to the exclusion 
of additional estimation uncertainty. When calling ""summary"" on the ""estimateEffect""  object, a 
regression table (Roberts, Margaret E., Brandon M. Stewart, and Dustin Tingley 2019) will be 
generated, providing valuable insights into the relationships between metadata and topics.  
 
The proportion of the data that is yes/no from 71,105 observations is as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl  are both “yes” – 26,315 observations.  
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl are both “no” – 4,265 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “yes” and ndd_lvl is “no” – 9,451 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “no” and ndd_lvl is “yes” – 31,074 observations.  
Page 11:
 
Page. 11  
  
Table 1 presents the outcomes derived from the ""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 3, 22, 47, 
68, and 83. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific topic, outlining associated terms, 
their respective estimates, standard errors, and p -values. The i ntercept in the table signifies 
instances where both THI and NDD stress levels are categorized as ""no stress."" Notably, this 
intercept remains statistically significant across all 90 topics.  
 
A broad interpretation of the model suggests that when comparing the intercept, symbolizing 
""no stress,"" to scenarios where THI and NDD indicate stress levels, the model tends to 
generate a list of more generic words and topics. This outcome is likely due to the climate 
conditions being categorized as ""no stress,"" indicating that farmers are less concerned about 
weather's impact on their agricultural activities.  
 
It's important to highlight that the model's output doesn't reveal any terms related to livestock 
or weather, indicating that the model is not performing as expected.

            Intercept here is defined as THI and NDD = “no stress”  
 
To explore the depth of the relationship between SMSs and topics, the ""findThoughts""  function 
is employed. Figure A.3 presents the top five SMSs associated with Topics 3, 22, and 47. 
Observing Figure A.3, it becomes evident that the received SMSs pertain to various queries 
without specific relevance to livestock or livestock feed crops. I t can be inferred that this 
interaction model did not yield the anticipated outcomes, as the associated words with topics

 seemed random and lacked the specificity needed to discern the nature of livestock -related 
inquiries that farmers seek from the iShamba platform.  
 
 
 
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the types of queries sent by 
livestock farmers to the iShamba platform and to enhance the platform's advisory capabilities 
based on the findings from this analysis. The interaction regression model yielded words that 
were associated with the ""no stress"" category. This outcome can be attributed to the simplified 
model, where classes of THI and N DD were simplified, leading the model to recognize words 
related to the ""no stress"" scenario.  
 
Shifting the focus away from the interaction model between THI and NDD, we proceeded to 
conduct separate regression analyses for THI and NDD. To facilitate this, both covariates were 
reverted to their original categorical forms:  
 
• For “ thi”:2 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized  as ""no stress""  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress""  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
 
• For “ndd”:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress""

 • NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress""  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress""  
 
 
Upon a more in-depth analysis of the data, a significant pattern has emerged. SMSs flagged 
with ""mild"" and ""moderate"" stress levels for THI collectively constitute 50.27% of the dataset. 
In contrast, for NDD, SMSs indicated as having ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and ""extreme "" stress 
levels make up a substantial portion, accounting for a total of 80.77% of the data. Notably, THI 
shows no distinct disparity between ""no stress"" and stress levels. Additionally, it's important to 
highlight that the THI data lacks instances of ""sev ere"" stress.  
 
The probability of selecting an SMS labeled with ""no stress"" as compared to stress levels 
labeled ""mild"" or ""moderate"" for THI stands at 50%. Due to this equal distribution, it becomes 
challenging for the THI model to effectively discern stress -related key words.  
 
In contrast, the prevalence of stress levels, encompassing ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and 
""extreme,"" is notably higher with NDD. Stress levels make up 80.77% of the data, whereas ""no 
stress"" levels constitute only 19.23%. Consequently, the NDD model is anticipa ted to 
effectively identify stress -related words and topics. Therefore, the subsequent ""estimateEffect"" 
results concentrate on scenarios where NDD serves as the covariate.  
 
The same STM model logic was applied to the NDD model, but this time the model had only 
one covariate with the four classes of NDD mentioned above. The searchK function was 
executed to determine the appropriate number of topics, and it also yielded K = 90,  indicating 
a more favorable distribution of topics towards the right side. This distribution suggests a 
better overall topic coverage. Figure A.4 below displays the outcomes of the STM model for 
NDD. Notably, this model generated more words that are close ly related to livestock or 
livestock feed.  
 
For instance, the “labelTopics” plot below , Topic 43 delves into crops such as millet, cassava, 
and peas that could be used for feeding livestock. On the other hand, Topic 63 addresses 
pesticide control for crops, which affects the well -being of livestock . Furthermore, Topic 48 
touches upon financial aspects, indicating that farmers might seek loans for their farms or 
intend to purchase more livestock. Meanwhile, Topic 58 addresses farmers' concerns about 
climate change and the prevailing conditions that m ay impact their farming activities in the 
present and future.

Page. 14  
 Figure A.4: Example of the output of NDD STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
Table 2, presented below, displays the regression outcomes derived from the NDD 
""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. The intercept within the table signifies 
the context where NDD stress level is classified as ""extreme stress."" Importantly, this intercept 
exhibits statistical significance across all 90 topics.  
 
Interpreting the model's outcomes reveals that for Topics 43 and 63, any incremental 
alteration in NDD stress levels classified as ""extreme stress"" elicits a shift in farmers' concerns 
towards crop -related issues and pesticide control. This alignment is ob servable in Figure A.4.  
 
As NDD conditions become more severe, observed through the significance of ""severe stress"" 
in Topic 58 at a 0.001 significance level, an increase of -0.0010 in NDD stress level appears to 
prompt farmers' apprehensions about climate conditions and their potential impact on farming 
activities. This prompts them to seek guidance from the iShamba platform before conditions 
escalate to the level of “extreme stress”.  
 
 
 
Page 15:
 
Page. 15  
  
 
To delve further into the intricacies of the relationship between SMSs and topics, Figure A.5 
showcases the top four SMSs associated with Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. It can be observed 
that the SMSs from farmers exhibit a strong correlation with topics related to livestock, climate, 
pesticides, and crops. However, it's important to note that this mo del also generated topics 
with seemingly random and basic words that are not inherently connected to livestock. This 
might be attributed to the presence of noise within the dataset, introducing some level of 
uncertainty.  
 
Page 16:
 
Page. 16  
  
 
To explore deeper into the results of the Estimateeffect model, we specifically focused on 
topics where a distinct difference was evident between the intercept (extreme stress) and no 
stress. This analysis led to the identification of approximately 52 such  topics. For each of these 
topics, we utilized the findthoughts function to extract 100 SMSs, resulting in a total of 5200 
observations.  
 
From these 5200 SMSs, we associated them with the corresponding wards by referencing the 
original dataset. Astonishingly, only 83 unique wards were represented out of the total 1450 
wards in the complete dataset.  
 
Further filtering was applied to isolate SMSs inquiring about climate, rain, and weather. This 
refinement resulted in 277 observations. Among these, 82 unique wards were found to have 
sent climate -related queries to the iShamba platform.

 Introduction  
 
iShamba, part of MediaE company, is a call centre  staffed by agricultural professionals where 
farmers can SMS in their inquiries or phone in for immediate assistance. Along with the weather 
updates and market prices, iShamba offers Agri -tips on crops and livestock after a farmer signs up. 
Farmers can eit her sign up for free or choose a premium plan for a small fee per year.  
Overview  
 
The Climate Action team's Livestock and Climate Initiative project, led by Scientist Dharani Dhar 
Burra, is interested in understanding historical messaging patterns and their correlation with 
climate hazards data from livestock farmers' current interactio ns with agriculture service provider 
platforms like iShamba. This information will further help to develop a high resolution targeted/ 
timely advisory package for livestock farmers through the service provider platforms.  
Objectives  
 
This project will aim to:  
 
1. Understand current trends/patterns of historical interactions of farmers with the iShamba 
platform.  
2. Identify if there is a pattern between messaging from farmers and climate hazards.  
3. We can then estimate farmers information requirements much ahead of time based on the 
forecasted climate hazards.  
4. This pre -emption of information requirement will then help us build more targeted advisory 
packages for the livestock farmers.  
5. Assess the applicability of the targeted advisories sent to the farmers through surveys.  
Data  
 
This project aims to analyze unstructured data from the iShamba platform, specifically text 
messages sent by farmers between the years 2015 to 2022. The initial plan was to utilize two 
years of data, but after preliminary data processing, many cases were d ropped due to incomplete 
or one -word messages received from the farmers, leading to a significant drop in the number of 
observations.         
 
The dataset received from the iShamba platform for the specified years contains 319,569 records. 
However, after data pre -processing and filtering to include only livestock -specific messages, and 
manually deleting duplicate SMS messages, the final sample si ze for this study is 72,062, with no 
missing data in the dataset.   
 
The variables included in the dataset are Task ID, Customer ID, Date, Time, Description, 
SMS sent by farmers, Responses to SMS, Assignees, Priority, SMS Tags, County, Sub - 
County, Wards, and x and y location points. The analysis will focus on the following  
variables:  
 
Page 4:
 
Page. 4  
 • Date - a character variable recorded by the platform for every farmer's inquiry received. The 
year and month will be extracted to calculate climate hazards later in the analysis.  
• SMS sent by farmers - a character variable containing the text messages received by 
farmers on the iShamba platform.  
• Sub-county - a character variable that records the county location of the farmer.  
• Ward - a character variable that records the sub -county location of the farmer.  
 
The number of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) are both recognized to reduce 
the productivity of livestock. However, the Agriculture Adaptation Atlas does not provide the mean 
number of NDD and THI for the years 2015 -2022. Therefore, bo th climate hazards were computed 
monthly for each year and ward using a projected climate hazards model. This will help to develop 
a relationship between the text messages received by farmers and both climate hazards. The 
overall goal of this relationship is to project future advisories that iShamba can send to livestock 
farmers regarding climate hazards at appropriate time in their location.  
 
Methodology  
 
I.Data Pre -Processing  
 
The data pre -processing for this project was conducted using R, due to the unstructured 
nature of the data. The initial step involved the removal of special characters, numbers, 
brackets, and quotes. This was followed by the separation of the time and date into new 
variables to extract the year and month for calculating the mean climate hazards in later 
analysis.  
 
The third step of the pre -processing included trimming the white spaces between text, 
selecting SMS messages that had a character count of 3 or above, and converting all text to 
lowercase. Additionally, some misspelled words in the SMS sent by farmers colu mn were 
corrected to enhance the accuracy of the subsequent analysis.  
 
A total of 140 wards were missing in the dataset, but their location points X and Y were 
available. To obtain the names of these wards, a join was performed with a Kenya shapefile 
dataset using the X and Y location points. This allowed for the extraction of the missing ward 
names, completing the dataset. Finally, records of counties that were not in Kenya and rows 
with ""NA"" across the county, sub -county, ward, and X and Y location points were dropped. The 
resulting p re-processed dataset had 252,759 observations.  
 
II.Filtering data to livestock  
 
To filter the dataset to focus only on livestock -related queries, a text analysis was performed 
using the ""Tm"" package in R to tokenize the SMS messages into words. A total of 264 words 
were removed, including non -English words and common words that were n ot relevant to the 
analysis. This resulted in a list of 81,114 unique words. The tokenized words list was then 
shared with iShamba to identify livestock -related words, which were flagged as ""high,"" while 
words that were not related to livestock were flagged as ""low."" This process yielded a list of 
Page 5:
 
Page. 5  
 5,956 unique words related to livestock. These words were used to filter the text messages to 
only include those that contained one or more words related to livestock.  
 
This filtering process resulted in a dataset of 78,169 observations. However, to eliminate 
duplicate SMS messages, a manual deletion process was conducted, resulting in a reduced 
dataset of 72,062 observations. A join operation was performed by creating a file containing 
unique IDs of sub -counties and wards, which was then merged with the filtered text data.  
 
To compute the monthly NDD and THI values for each ward, the same computation steps 
used for the development of the global adaptation atlas ( AdaptationAtlas - hazards ) were 
applied. The resulting data was aggregated to obtain average values for each month/year and 
ward. These average values were appended to the iShamba dataset, which contained the 
corresponding month, year, and ward for each SMS message.  
 
To facilitate analysis and interpretation, the NDD and THI values were transformed into new 
binary categorical variables as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl: a character variable defined as1: 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress"" = “yes”,  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”.  
 
• ndd_lvl: a character variable defined as:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress"" = “yes”.  
 
Consequently, the final dataset consists of 72,062 observations and includes six variables: 
SMS (actual) by farmers, month, year, ward, thi_lvl, and ndd_lvl. This filtered dataset was 
used for the subsequent analysis.  
 
III.Analysis  
 
Structural Topic Model (STM) provides a variety of statistical approaches for analyzing text 
data. The STM allows one to discover topics and estimate their relationship to document 
metadata. The  “stm” package in R provides tools to facilitate the workflow associated with 
analyzing textual data and users have a broad array of options to process raw text data, 
explore and analyze the data, and present findings using a variety of plotting tools.  
 
The steps involved in the STM topic prevalence model are as follows:  
 
1. Loading the data in R:  The ""stm"" package represents the text corpus in three parts:  
 
• A documents list containing word indices and their associated counts.  
 
1 The iShamba data has no THI “sever stress” cases.  
Page 6:
 
Page. 6  
 • A vocab character vector containing the words associated with the word indices.  
• A metadata matrix containing document covariates.  
 
2. Applying the ""textProcessor"" function:  This function is used to preprocess the data 
by removing punctuation, eliminating stop words, and stemming the words. It leverages 
the ""tm"" package and can be applied across multiple languages.  
 
3. Using the utility function ""prepDocuments"":  This function processes the loaded 
data to ensure it is in the correct format. It can also remove infrequent terms based on 
a user -set parameter called ""lower.thresh."" Additionally, ""prepDocuments""  will re -
index all metadata and document relationships if any changes occur during the 
processing. If a document is completely removed due to preprocessing (e.g., if it 
contained only rare words), the corresponding row in the metadata will be dropped. It i s 
important to inspect the document features and vocabulary list after reading and 
processing the text data to verify that the preprocessing steps have been applied 
correctly . 
 
These steps are crucial for preparing the data for the subsequent stages of the STM topic 
prevalence model. After the data import process in steps 2 and 3, the text corpus includes of 
71,105 documents and 16,467 tokens.  
 
4. Exploration of Topic Model s: Determining the optimal number of topics for a given 
corpus is not a straightforward task (Grimmer and Stewart 2013). To address this 
challenge, the ""searchK""  function employs a data -driven approach to select the 
appropriate number of topics. This function conducts various automated tests, such as 
calculating the held -out likelihood (Wallach et al. 2009) and performing residual 
analysis (Taddy 2012). By default , the ""Spectral""  initialization method is used due to 
its stability. Additionally, the ""searchK""  function computes several informative metrics, 
including average exclusivity and semantic coherence, to assist in the selection 
process.  
 
5. Estimating the structural topic model (STM):  After determining the optimal number 
of topics, the next crucial step is to estimate the STM. This process involves using 
various functions to assess, comprehend, and visualize the fitted model object. One 
key advantage of STM is its ability to incorporat e metadata into the topic modeling 
framework, enhancing the analysis in two ways:  
 
• topical prevalence:  Metadata covariates for topical prevalence enable the 
observed metadata to influence how frequently a topic is discussed.  
• topical content:  Covariates in topical content allow the observed metadata to 
affect the rate of word usage within a specific topic, shaping how that topic is 
discussed.  
 
When running the STM model, multiple arguments will be used, including the output from the 
prepDocuments  () function, which provides a documents column, a vocab column, and a meta 
column. The number of topics (K) identified using the ""searchK"" function will also be specified. 
Additionally, the ""init.type"" will be set to ""Spectral."" Lastly, the ""prevalence"" a rgument will be  
Page 7:
 
Page. 7  
 utilized to specify the metadata variables of interest as covariates, represented as an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and ""ndd_lvl.""  
 
6. Interpreting STM model results:  Once a suitable model has been chosen, the next 
crucial step involves interpreting the results. There are various methods to explore the 
output and gain insights from the STM model. The stm package provides several 
options to investigate and analyse the m odel's outcomes:  
 
• Displaying words associated with Topics : The “labelTopics”  function, along 
with the plot method for 'STM' objects (with the argument type = ""labels""), and the 
“sageLabels”  function (with the plot method for 'STM' objects, using the argument 
type = ""perspectives""), allow users to view the words closely associated with each 
topic. Additionally, the “findThoughts”  and “plotQuote”  functions are useful for 
identifying documents that have strong associations with specific topics.  
• Estimating relationships between Metadata and Topics:  The “estimateEffect”  
function can be employed to estimate the relationships between metadata 
variables and topics, as well as the topical content. This facilitates understanding 
how certain metadata covariates influence the prevalence and content of different 
topics.  
• Calculating Topic Correlations:  To measure the correlations between different 
topics, the “topicCorr”  function can be utilized, providing valuable insights into 
the relationships between various topics within the model.  
 
7. Shiny Application for inspecting STM results:  The “stminsights”  package in R 
enables interactive validation, interpretation, and visualization of one or several 
Structural Topic Models (STM).  
 
8. Stupid Back -off (SBO) model  – The “sbo” package in R will be used using the N -
gram model to build a predictive model that will take space -time stamp  and stress 
conditions to predict the next word(s).  
Results  
 
I.Determining the number of topics  
 
To identify the optimal number of topics for the analysis, the searchK function from the STM 
package in R will be utilized. This function takes several arguments, including the output from 
the prepDocuments() function. The number of topics (K) will be expl ored in the range of 30 to 
100. Additionally, the ""init.type"" parameter will be set to ""Spectral"" to improve the initialization 
process. Furthermore, the ""prevalence"" argument will be specified, allowing for the inclusion of 
metadata variables as covariate s, represented as an interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and 
""ndd_lvl."" This data -driven approach will help determine the most appropriate number of topics 
to be used by comparing the exclusivity and sematic scores between topics in the subsequent 
analysis.  
 
The results presented in Figure A showcase four key metrics used to assess the model 
quality: held -out likelihood, residual dispersion, topic semantic coherence, and the 
Page 8:
 
Page. 8  
 approximation to the lower -bound of the marginal likelihood. The objective is to maximize the 
held-out likelihood, semantic coherence, and lower -bound while minimizing the dispersion of 
residuals. These metrics collectively aid in determining the most reli able and robust model for 
the analysis.  
 
Figure A: Diagnostic Values for STM Model  (Sequence of Topics 30 -100) 
 
 
 
To evaluate the strength of the modelled topics and choose the appropriate number of topics 
for the analysis, we refer to Figure A.1, which displays a comparison of different STM models 
with varying numbers of topics. Models with K = 30 and K = 40 exhibit a narrower spread of 
topics towards the right side, and both models contain some topics that are considered 
outliers. On the other hand, models with K = 80 and K = 90 show a more favorable spread of 
topics towards the right, indicating a better distribution. Among these models, model 90 stands 
out, as it contains numerous topics with high exclusivity and semantic scores, making it the 
most suitable choice for further analysis.

II.Interpreting the STM by plotting and inspecting res ults 
 
After selecting the appropriate model with the desired number of topics, the next crucial step is 
to interpret the results of the STM model. The ""stm"" package offers several functions to 
explore the model's outcomes effectively. One such approach is to examine collections of 
words associated with each topic using the ""labelTopics"" function. Figure A.2 ill ustrates a 
sample output of the STM model, presenting four types of word weightings:  
 
• Highest Probability : This includes words within each topic with the highest probability, 
directly inferred from the topic -word distribution parameter β.  
• FREX:  Words are weighted based on their overall frequency and their exclusivity to the 
topic.  
• Lift: Words are weighted by dividing their frequency in the current topic by their 
frequency in other topics, giving higher weight to words that appear less frequently in 
other topics.  
• Score:  This weighting divides the log frequency of the word in the current topic by the 
log frequency of the word in other topics.  
 
It is advisable to prioritize using FREX words as they highlight words that carry significant 
weight and are unique to each topic. As evident in Figure A.2, Topic 22 is associated with 
farmers seeking information on grazing and breeds through the iShamba p latform, while Topic 
3 and Topic 47 both lack any coherent association with a specific topic. Additionally, Topic 68 
Page 10:
 
Page. 10  
 discusses harvest -related matters, and Topic 83 focuses on farmers seeking advice and 
assistance from the iShamba platform regarding farming activities.  
 
Figure A .2: Example of the output of STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
 
Another valuable approach is to estimate the relationships between metadata and topics using 
the ""estimateEffect""  function. These relationships play a crucial role in validating the topic 
model's effectiveness (Grimmer 2010; Grimmer and Stewart 2013). This function performs 
regression, treating documents as the units, the proportion of each document about a topic in 
an STM model as the outcome, and document metadata as covariates. The method of 
composition is used to incorporate measurement uncertainty from the STM model. The 
""estimateEffect""  function requires several arguments, including the formula representing an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl""  and "" ndd_lvl"",  the output of the STM model, and the metadata. 
The ""uncertainty""  parameter is set to ""Global""  by default, which considers the estimation 
uncertainty of topic proportions in the uncertainty estimates using the method of composition. 
Alternatively, users can choose ""None""  for uncertainty if they do not wish to propagate the full 
amount of uncertainty, which might result in narrower confidence intervals due to the exclusion 
of additional estimation uncertainty. When calling ""summary"" on the ""estimateEffect""  object, a 
regression table (Roberts, Margaret E., Brandon M. Stewart, and Dustin Tingley 2019) will be 
generated, providing valuable insights into the relationships between metadata and topics.  
 
The proportion of the data that is yes/no from 71,105 observations is as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl  are both “yes” – 26,315 observations.  
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl are both “no” – 4,265 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “yes” and ndd_lvl is “no” – 9,451 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “no” and ndd_lvl is “yes” – 31,074 observations.  
Page 11:
 
Page. 11  
  
Table 1 presents the outcomes derived from the ""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 3, 22, 47, 
68, and 83. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific topic, outlining associated terms, 
their respective estimates, standard errors, and p -values. The i ntercept in the table signifies 
instances where both THI and NDD stress levels are categorized as ""no stress."" Notably, this 
intercept remains statistically significant across all 90 topics.  
 
A broad interpretation of the model suggests that when comparing the intercept, symbolizing 
""no stress,"" to scenarios where THI and NDD indicate stress levels, the model tends to 
generate a list of more generic words and topics. This outcome is likely due to the climate 
conditions being categorized as ""no stress,"" indicating that farmers are less concerned about 
weather's impact on their agricultural activities.  
 
It's important to highlight that the model's output doesn't reveal any terms related to livestock 
or weather, indicating that the model is not performing as expected.  
 
 
      Signif . codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1  
            Intercept here is defined as THI and NDD = “no stress”  
 
To explore the depth of the relationship between SMSs and topics, the ""findThoughts""  function 
is employed. Figure A.3 presents the top five SMSs associated with Topics 3, 22, and 47. 
Observing Figure A.3, it becomes evident that the received SMSs pertain to various queries 
without specific relevance to livestock or livestock feed crops. I t can be inferred that this 
interaction model did not yield the anticipated outcomes, as the associated words with topics

 seemed random and lacked the specificity needed to discern the nature of livestock -related 
inquiries that farmers seek from the iShamba platform.  
 
 
 
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the types of queries sent by 
livestock farmers to the iShamba platform and to enhance the platform's advisory capabilities 
based on the findings from this analysis. The interaction regression model yielded words that 
were associated with the ""no stress"" category. This outcome can be attributed to the simplified 
model, where classes of THI and N DD were simplified, leading the model to recognize words 
related to the ""no stress"" scenario.  
 
Shifting the focus away from the interaction model between THI and NDD, we proceeded to 
conduct separate regression analyses for THI and NDD. To facilitate this, both covariates were 
reverted to their original categorical forms:  
 
• For “ thi”:2 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized  as ""no stress""  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress""  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
 
• For “ndd”:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress""  
 
2 The iShamba data has no THI “severe stress” cases.

 • NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress""  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress""  
 
 
Upon a more in-depth analysis of the data, a significant pattern has emerged. SMSs flagged 
with ""mild"" and ""moderate"" stress levels for THI collectively constitute 50.27% of the dataset. 
In contrast, for NDD, SMSs indicated as having ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and ""extreme "" stress 
levels make up a substantial portion, accounting for a total of 80.77% of the data. Notably, THI 
shows no distinct disparity between ""no stress"" and stress levels. Additionally, it's important to 
highlight that the THI data lacks instances of ""sev ere"" stress.  
 
The probability of selecting an SMS labeled with ""no stress"" as compared to stress levels 
labeled ""mild"" or ""moderate"" for THI stands at 50%. Due to this equal distribution, it becomes 
challenging for the THI model to effectively discern stress -related key words.  
 
In contrast, the prevalence of stress levels, encompassing ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and 
""extreme,"" is notably higher with NDD. Stress levels make up 80.77% of the data, whereas ""no 
stress"" levels constitute only 19.23%. Consequently, the NDD model is anticipa ted to 
effectively identify stress -related words and topics. Therefore, the subsequent ""estimateEffect"" 
results concentrate on scenarios where NDD serves as the covariate.  
 
The same STM model logic was applied to the NDD model, but this time the model had only 
one covariate with the four classes of NDD mentioned above. The searchK function was 
executed to determine the appropriate number of topics, and it also yielded K = 90,  indicating 
a more favorable distribution of topics towards the right side. This distribution suggests a 
better overall topic coverage. Figure A.4 below displays the outcomes of the STM model for 
NDD. Notably, this model generated more words that are close ly related to livestock or 
livestock feed.  
 
For instance, the “labelTopics” plot below , Topic 43 delves into crops such as millet, cassava, 
and peas that could be used for feeding livestock. On the other hand, Topic 63 addresses 
pesticide control for crops, which affects the well -being of livestock . Furthermore, Topic 48 
touches upon financial aspects, indicating that farmers might seek loans for their farms or 
intend to purchase more livestock. Meanwhile, Topic 58 addresses farmers' concerns about 
climate change and the prevailing conditions that m ay impact their farming activities in the 
present and future.

 Figure A.4: Example of the output of NDD STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
Table 2, presented below, displays the regression outcomes derived from the NDD 
""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. The intercept within the table signifies 
the context where NDD stress level is classified as ""extreme stress."" Importantly, this intercept 
exhibits statistical significance across all 90 topics.  
 
Interpreting the model's outcomes reveals that for Topics 43 and 63, any incremental 
alteration in NDD stress levels classified as ""extreme stress"" elicits a shift in farmers' concerns 
towards crop -related issues and pesticide control. This alignment is ob servable in Figure A.4.  
 
As NDD conditions become more severe, observed through the significance of ""severe stress"" 
in Topic 58 at a 0.001 significance level, an increase of -0.0010 in NDD stress level appears to 
prompt farmers' apprehensions about climate conditions and their potential impact on farming 
activities. This prompts them to seek guidance from the iShamba platform before conditions 
escalate to the level of “extreme stress”.

To delve further into the intricacies of the relationship between SMSs and topics, Figure A.5 
showcases the top four SMSs associated with Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. It can be observed 
that the SMSs from farmers exhibit a strong correlation with topics related to livestock, climate, 
pesticides, and crops. However, it's important to note that this mo del also generated topics 
with seemingly random and basic words that are not inherently connected to livestock. This 
might be attributed to the presence of noise within the dataset, introducing some level of 
uncertainty.

Page. 16  
  
 
To explore deeper into the results of the Estimateeffect model, we specifically focused on 
topics where a distinct difference was evident between the intercept (extreme stress) and no 
stress. This analysis led to the identification of approximately 52 such  topics. For each of these 
topics, we utilized the findthoughts function to extract 100 SMSs, resulting in a total of 5200 
observations.  
 
From these 5200 SMSs, we associated them with the corresponding wards by referencing the 
original dataset. Astonishingly, only 83 unique wards were represented out of the total 1450 
wards in the complete dataset.  
 
Further filtering was applied to isolate SMSs inquiring about climate, rain, and weather. This 
refinement resulted in 277 observations. Among these, 82 unique wards were found to have 
sent climate -related queries to the iShamba platform.

The effective and efficient water resource conservation and management necessary to mitigate the crisis requires monitoring data, especially on water quality. This is recognized by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, particularly indicator 6.3.2., which requires all UN member states to measure and report the ‘proportion of water bodies with good ambient water quality’. However, gathering sufficient data on water quality is reliant on data collection at spatial and temporal scales that are generally outside the capacity of institutions using conventional methods. Digital technologies, such as wireless sensor networks and remote sensing, have come to the fore as promising avenues to increase the scope of data collection and reporting. Citizen science (which goes by many names, e.g., participatory science or community-based monitoring) has also been earmarked as a powerful mechanism to improve monitoring. However, both avenues have drawbacks and limitations. The synergy between the strengths of modern technologies and citizen science presents an opportunity to use the best features of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the other. This paper briefly synthesizes recent research illustrating how smartphones, sometimes in conjunction with other sensors, present a nexus point method for citizen scientists to engage with and use sophisticated modern technology for water quality monitoring. This paper also presents a brief, non-exhaustive research synthesis of some examples of current technological upgrades or innovations regarding smartphones in citizen science water quality monitoring in developing countries and how these can assist in objective, comprehensive, and improved data collection, management and reporting. While digital innovations are being rapidly developed worldwide, there remains a paucity of scientific and socioeconomic validation of their suitability and usefulness within citizen science. This perhaps contributes to the fact that the uptake and upscaling of smartphone-assisted citizen science continues to underperform compared to its potential within water resource management and SDG reporting. Ultimately, we recommend that more rigorous scientific research efforts be dedicated to exploring the suitability of digital innovations in citizen science in the context of developing countries and SDG reporting.

1. Background  
Natural  systems are  inherently  complex  webs  of interconnected 
components that encompass environment, ecosystems, and 
numerous earth system processes operating at scales. Human 
activities and their iterations with these systems make them 
more complex leading to several intended and unintended 
consequences with dynamic feedback loops. While these 
complexities have always existed, these have increased due to 
the recent  technological  explosion  (Sargut  and McGrath,  2011). 
As averred by Sargut and McGrath (2011), the complexity has 
gone from something found in large confined systems, such as 
factories  and cities, to remote environments  such as entire river 
basins. The non -linear effects and dynamic feedback loops  from the natural systems and their human interactions are 
making it harder to predict what will happen because they 
interact  in unexpected ways  and are difficult  to manage.  This is 
especially true where reliable data are not easily accessible.  
River basins are complex natural systems where human 
activities imparted profound influence on water, land, 
ecosystems, and climate patterns. There is no doubt that the 
management of the water resources of a basin is a complex 
issue due to the inherent interplay  of the changing environment 
(Bernhardt et al., 2006; Cosgrove and Loucks, 2015; Leb et  al., 
2018; Young and Harshadeep, 2020). River basin ecosystems 
provide  water  resources  for agriculture,  livestock,  and fisheries, 
industry and for domestic use, sustaining the livelihoods of

millions  of people  in the region.  Nonetheless,  these  river  basin 
ecosystems are also subject to hydroclimatic extremes, land 
degradation, poor water quality, urbanization and population 
growth. These environmental shifts not only pose a threat to 
the rich biodiversity in river basins but also weaken the 
resilience of local communities to climate change (Fazey et  
al., 2021; Carmen et al, 2022).  
To effectively manage these complex natural systems 
impacted by human activities, there is a need to leverage 
technological advancements such as high -performance 
computing,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  and real-time database 
management  systems.  The DT concept  is an advanced  version 
of traditional Decision Support Systems (DSS) used to 
manage water resources and environmental processes in river 
basin ecosystems. By utilizing new generation sensors, big 
data, cloud processing and AI, a digital representation of the 
river basin is created, providing a dynamic framework that 
offers comprehensive information for effective management.  
A DT is a rapidly emerging concept that digitally depicts an 
object, a process, or a system (Grieves, 2014; Ademenko et  
al., 2020 and references therein). Grieves and Vickers (2004) 
pioneered the work of DT and presented a DT framework as 
comprising three components, a physical object, a digital 
representation of that object, and the bi -directional data 
connections that feed data from the physical to the digital 
representation, and information and processes from  the digital 
representation  to the physical  (Figure  1). DT has the capability 
of accelerating innovation (e.g., improved modelling of  
system changes or optimized business supply chains) if 
coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT) or AI (Jones et al., 
2020).  
A review  of DT literature by  Jones  et al. (2020)  demonstrated 
increased interest in recent years across both academia and 
industry as seen in the growth in the number of related 
publications,  processes,  concepts,  and envisaged  benefits.  In a 
bid to determine if DT could be used in the Nature -based 
Solutions (NbS) for stormwater and transboundary water  security projects, the existing conceptual challenges and the 
DT definition as a framework were examined (Brasil et al., 
2022). They identified how the mathematical modelling 
reported in the literature could improve the DT development, 
and evaluated the potential benefits associated with the 
application of DT in NbS. Noting the sparse presence of DT 
applications in water resource management and in particular 
river basin management, the present review aims to a)  
establish the role of AI techniques such as machine learning, 
deep learning, and data analytics in enhancing the predictive 
and decision -making capabilities of digital twins, b) compile 
information about existing DT applications in developing 
countries,  c) assess  the DT infrastructure,  architecture  and data 
governance frameworks, and d) characterize the relevant DT 
use cases for river basin management. This review contributes 
towards developing a robust conceptual framework for an 
operational Limpopo River Basin DT.  
2. Literature  Review  
The era of digital technologies capable of transforming the 
livelihoods of developing country populace is now more 
obvious. Yet the inherent core pillars including the digital 
infrastructure, human capital and enabling environment, 
continue to act as impediments to these countries’ massive 
digital ecosystem potential that is hugely needed for socio - 
economic equitable growth (Union, 2020). Juxtaposing the 
role that water sensitive sectors  play in support  of advancing 
economic  growth,  socio - and gender  equity  and creating  jobs 
under changing climate, this underscores the value of  digital 
innovation ecosystem in the context of water resource 
management (Shilin et al., 2021; Józefowicz et al., 2023).

Figure 3 Trends of research themes. Upper -right quadrant are the motor themes (hot topics); themes appearing in the  upper -left quadrant are considered very spe - 
cialized  topics -niche  themes;  the lower  right  are termed basic  themes;  emerging  or declining  themes  are generally  weakly  developed,  have  low density,  low central - 
ity and are either emerging or disappearing.  
 
Fortunately,  our world  is abuzz  with disruptive  technologies 
that are transforming  the way  we respond to the  present  and 
future challenges. The digital transformation strategy for 
Africa (2020 -2030), avers that;  
“Africa presents a sea of economic opportunities in 
virtually every sector, and the continent’s youthful 
population structure is an enormous opportunity in 
this digital  era and hence  the need  for Africa  to make 
digitally  enabled  socio -economic  development  a high 
priority.”  
Against  the backdrop  of the digital  transformation  strategy  for 
Africa, there is need to ameliorate the unique challenges of 
adoption of digital technologies across Africa. There is no 
doubt that the new technologies and approaches for 
digitalizing and smartening water systems through Big Data, 
algorithm  development  and Artificial  Intelligence  (using  Deep  & Machine Learning) are increasingly being recognized 
globally. While Digital Agriculture & Digital Water 
Innovations (hereafter DA -DW-I) have a global footprint, 
arguments  for their impact  and developmental  implications  are 
generally subtle in the global South (e.g., Amankwa et al., 
2021).

Figure  4 Content  analysis  of Digital  Twin  scholarship  in Africa  (Source:  Authors)  
 
Peer-reviewed published literature on DT and river basin 
management in scientific databases (e.g., Scopus and Web of 
Science (WoS)), illustrates that the global DT scholarship on 
river basin management is generally a nascent research  
agenda. This evidence is illustrated by more than 12 years of 
publications given in Figure 2, wherein the majority of the 
scientific  articles  focusing  on DT only emerge  in the past three 
years. There were 41 peer -reviewed scientific publications on  
 
Table  2 Nature  of country  collaboration  on the DT publications  in Africa  DT with river basin references. In terms of the research 
interests across countries, the review analysis suggests that 
China  and South  African  researchers  are at the forefront,  albeit 
surprisingly lacking collaboration as most publications focus 
on single country (Table 1). In terms of emerging themes in  
the DT research domain, the review established that there are 
subtle hot topics (upper right), very specialized (upper left) as 
well as basic (lower right) and emerging (lower left) research 
themes as depicted in  Figure 3. The evolution of the research 
themes from a global perspective is expected to change as the 
direction of DT scholarship changes in future.  
In reviewing published literature on DT in Africa, few key 
words were used i.e., “Digital Twin” and “Africa” and the 
search kept to “within” abstracts only.  Only nineteen articles 
(17 from Scopus and 2 from WoS) were extracted that had 
some  content  on DT. A quick  analysis  of the trends,  and social

networks of the DT scholarship illustrated that the scientific 
discourse only emerged in databases considered from 2018 
(only one article) with most articles published in 2023 (7 
seven  articles).  Seven  peer reviewed  scientific  publications  on 
DT (where river basin management is also mentioned) were 
published between 2020 and 2022. The composition of the 
article types illustrated that most of the DT research has 
mostly  appeared  in scientific  conferences,  while  five, two, and 
four appeared in Journals, Book Chapters and Reviews 
respectively.  The nature of publication collaborations by 
country, Table 2, illustrates that DT scholars from South 
Africa and the United Kingdom exhibit both single and 
multiple country publications while France, Germany and 
Morocco have single country publications. To understand the 
research direction or applications of DT in Africa, Figure 4 
shows the content analysis of abstracts of the 17 reviewed 
articles. Though research on DT in the African continent is 
still at it’s infancy, content analysis results of the reviewed 
articles given in Figure 4 bring forth three main research 
directions,  i.e., methodology, applications  and use. It however 
important to note that these results are not exhaustive at this 
stage.  
Smart City  and Digital Twin City  are new novel methods of 
city management  being  implemented  worldwide,  in response 
to the expansion  of cities  and megacities  in the current  era of technology  disruption,  rapid  urbanization  and climate  change. 
For instance, in 2021, the University of Pretoria announced 
the creation of Hatfield Digital Twin City, a novel initiative  
that aims to boost service delivery with the help of smart 
technology (Figure 5).  
A literature  search  of smart  city applications  of DT in  the 
African continent resulted to only the following notable 
publications:  
a) Nigerian  Electricity  Supply  Industry  (NESI): Aliyu et  al. 
(2021)  analyzed  the NESI  framework  and concluded  that 
the system uses a novel framework that is premised on a 
SoS and digital twins.  
b) Broekman  and Steyn  (2022)  reported  on Digital  Twinning 
of Lap -based Marathon Infrastructure: the digitization of 
the marathon route using Real -Time Kinematic Global 
Navigation Satellite Systems (RTK GNSS) and high - 
density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensing 
capabilities to allow for the detailed geometry 
measurements and environmental analysis before and  
after such events. They concluded that the intersection of 
engineering and sports disciplines and technology 
illustrates the potential realization of smart cities and 
recreation in an evolutionary society.

South Africa.  
3. Digital  Twins  and Virtual  Reality  
In the rapidly advancing technological era we inhabit,  it is 
advantageous to critically evaluate the functionalities and 
applicability  of immersive and interactive digital technologies 
such as Virtual  Reality  (VR)  to sectors  which  impact  our well- 
being and quality of life in sectors such as agriculture and 
water management. Furthermore, it is important to explore 
how these  emergent  technologies  like VR can shape  and guide  decision making in water resources management, aid in risk 
management  and accelerate  technology  usage.  This will result 
in the generation of innovative technology -based solutions 
toward solving river basin challenges to ameliorate humanity 
and the sustainability of food and water resources.  
Gigante (1993) defines VR as being “characterized by the 
illusion of participation in a synthetic environment than 
external  observation  of such an environment.  It relies  on three - 
dimensional, stereoscopic, head -tracked displays, hand/body 
tracking, and binaural sound”. Additionally, VR may be 
delineated as an immersive, multisensory experience ( Holuša, 
et al., 2023; Azarby, & Rice, 2022). It is also referred to as 
providing virtual environments, virtual worlds, or 
microworlds. A journal titled, Development of a Digital Twin 
for smart farming: Irrigation management system for water  
Page 7:
WORKING  PAPER  
CGIAR  Initiative  on Digital  Innovation  | on.cgiar.org/digital  
7  
 saving  asserts  that the “digital  twin applied  to agriculture  is in 
its early stages of development”. It further defines a digital 
twin as an entity where “data flows automatically and in both 
directions between a physical object and a virtual  
object” (Alves, Maia & Lima, 2023). It is imperative to note 
that the adoption of these technologies is in an experimental 
phase and the consolidation of two or more technologies such 
as DT and VR is an even more recently employed practice. A 
literature  review  on the linkages  between  VR and DT revealed 
an interesting pattern of these two concepts. The concepts of 
VR and DT seems to have appeared only in the last two 
decades  (based  on the Scopus  and WoS  databases).  According 
to the two databases, 857 articles (comprising of largely 
journal articles -50%; and conference papers -25%). Most of  
the scholarship only emerged post -2018. In terms of the 
linkages between DT, VR and Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Figure  6 illustrates  detailed  interconnections  between  the three 
concepts and other antecedent terminologies. As shown in 
Figure 6, there are intrinsic interlinkages between these three 
concepts  and other  concepts  such as data analytics,  augmented 
reality, machine learning – all related to advanced 
computational techniques.  
There are a host of possibilities for the application of 
technologies such as DT and VR to actively address water 
management concerns specific to river basins in developing 
African  countries.  The unique  characteristics  DT and VR offer 
respectively  and when  combined provide  useful  real-time data 
to allow  for the continuous monitoring of river basins. Firstly, 
DT and VR offer accessible realistic digital visualizations 
which enable integrated river basin modelling. While DT 
establishes a real -time virtual representation of the river basin 
presenting water flow, dam operations, pollution sources and 
other environmental elements, VR allows for the visual 
navigation of the DT model and permits interactivity where 
users may directly impact the virtual environment they are 
visiting using their senses including sight, touch, smell and 
hearing to observe the real -time condition of river basins.  
River basins play a pivotal role in supplying fresh water and 
regulating water flow and quality. A DT and VR 
collaboratively  may be used to monitor the physical condition 
of the river basins. The DT will provide the data analytics 
required while VR will allow scientists and engineers to 
conduct virtual inspections and assessments eliminating the 
need for them to be physically present. Lastly, in the case of 
water  crises  such as droughts  or floods  the data extracted  from  the DT can  be analysed  to predict  heavy  rainfalls  that may 
cause  floods  or increased  evapotranspiration  and the over- 
extraction of ground water that may cause droughts.  
Concurrently,  VR can be employed  to pre-visualize  droughts 
and floods  before  they occur  to implement  prevention  tactics 
or mitigate the impact if inevitable.  
An exemplary  case study where DT and VR has been  utilized 
cooperatively  to combat  agricultural  related  challenges  can be 
seen through AgroIT, a company that provides technological 
solutions for the agricultural sector, particularly focusing on 
precision agriculture. AgroIT's platform uses Digital Twin 
technology to create a virtual representation of farmlands, 
incorporating data like soil conditions, weather, and crop 
health. On the VR front, they have explored its use for 
visualizing these digital farms. This combination allows 
farmers to virtually 'walk' through their fields, visualize 
potential problem areas, and make informed decisions about 
irrigation, fertilization and other operations1. 
The ambitions  of DT and VR for environmental  application in 
developing countries based on its previous uses are to aid in 
water resource management systems. This one day may be as 
advanced as integrated user interfaces. Virtual reality is also 
known as an ‘empathy machine’ because of its unique ability 
to immerse users in emotionally charged perspectives, 
experiences, and environments which may prompt positive 
actions  and behaviors  in real life. Through  the advancement  of 
brain -computer interfaces users might control DT simulations 
or navigate VR environments using their thoughts. This could 
lead to more intuitive user experiences and might even allow 
for emotion -driven simulations, where users can ""feel"" the 
impacts of different river management decisions. DT and VR 
technologies strategically locate themselves at the heart of 
digital innovation as solution -based methods that directly 
address the need for visual representations to accurately 
measure the state of water, food and land conditions within 
various  regions  susceptible to food and water wastage, natural 
disasters and shortages. Researchers and scientists look 
forward to the progression of these technologies and the 
problems they will solve in the water management sector. A 
consideration of the manner we orient and define DT and VR 
as their operations evolve and their capacity expands will be 
essential to the integration and assimilation of these ever - 
changing digital innovations.

4. Stakeholder  Needs  Assessment  
DT models are anchored on data from various life cycle 
phases that ought to be collected and analyzed to deliver 
services to a myriad of stakeholders. The utility of the DT 
services is dependent on the level of alignment with 
stakeholder needs. In order ensure uptake of the DT services, 
there  is need  to undertake  stakeholder  engagement  through  the 
development phases of the DT design and implementation.  
Stakeholders are defined as all groups and individuals who 
influence the aims of an organization, project or product and 
vice versa (Freeman and McVea, 2005). As part of  
stakeholder analysis, the stakeholders, their interests and their 
characteristics are identified. This is followed by clustering 
and prioritization  of the stakeholders.  After  analysis,  a strategy 
and recommended actions can be defined (Ramirez, 1999).  
From the DT design and implementation perspective, a 
stakeholder typology reported in Mitchael et al., (1997) as 
well as stakeholder identification based on the interest - 
influence matrix  reported in  e.g., Janssens  de Bisthoven  et al., 
(2022) should be considered. All the DT use cases relevant to 
river -based  management  presented  in Section  7.2, undertook  a 
well-designed iterative stakeholder engagement process  
during the design and implementation of the DT.  
5. 3D Representation  of a River  Basin  Digital 
Twin  
The emergence  of digital  twin technology  has revolutionized 
several fields,  from  manufacturing  to urban  planning  (Tao  et 
al., 2018).  The application  of this innovative  concept  to river basin management using the 3D Representation provides a 
compelling overview of the potential benefits and challenges 
faced.  A river  basin,  being  a complex  system  with a myriad of 
interrelated components such as water flow, sediment 
transport, vegetation, and human interventions, necessitates a 
robust modeling approach. The three -dimensional 
representation in the mentioned work provides a vivid and 
detailed visualization of these elements, making it an 
invaluable tool for stakeholders.  
6. Data  Infrastructure  Architecture  for a Digital 
Twin  
The envisioned  DT architecture  is often  characterized  by two 
main  typologies  - monitoring  and predictive  DT as  described 
in Figure 7. The monitoring typology  represents the past and 
present dynamics of the physical and social -economic 
properties and interactions with the hydroclimatic 
environment, where a virtual representation is created using 
this data. From the perspective of predictive typology, 
predictive models will use past and present data to create a 
plausible future rendition of the present state of the 
environment.  
As reported  in Brasil  et al. (2022)  and Dhulipala  (2021),  a DT 
conceptual framework comprises the components briefly 
described below (also see Figure 8):  
a) Data  source  layer:  to accurately  represent  the LRB  in a 
digital space, various data sets will be required. These 
data sets ought to represent not only the physical  
Page 9:

Figure  8 The physical  environment,  data storage,  digital  environment  and applications  services  of the Digital  Twin  (Adapted  from  Brasil  et al., 2022)  
 
environment but also the biological and chemical 
conditions of the basin. Some of the data sources may 
include, remotely sensed data -from satellites and/or 
drones, hydrological process model data, ground 
observations (e.g., water quality/proxy measurements, 
weather  data,  mobile  app captured  data sets),  and thirty 
party datasets which are often analysis ready (e.g., 
climatic data from  the Digital Earth Africa platform  or 
non-climatic datasets  from  the National Department of 
Statistics).  
b) Data processing layer: One of the key functions of this 
layer is to pre -process and format the various data sets to 
ensure inter -operability among the various strands of the 
data. In addition, this layer executes a set of data 
modelling functions including hydrological process 
modelling, climate data downscaling and bias correction, 
satellite image classing to derive various product 
including  hydroclimatic  extremes  and irrigated  area maps.  
c) Data visualization and analytic layer: Based on the 
outputs  in b), this layer  comprises  GIS-enabled  analytic  tools embedded with dashboards to display various user 
selected features. Some of the key  outputs from  this layer 
would be the early warning messages that denote 
hydroclimatic  extremes,  risk areas  and the general  state of 
the river basin.  
d) Advisory and dissemination layer: this layer is a rule 
engine  embedded  decision  support  rule system  that helps 
provide intelligent management options suited for the 
present  and future  physical  state of the river  basin.  These 
decisions are often disseminated using channels such as 
SMS/USSD, web and mobile applications, and even 
tower broadcasts once the system is implemented.  
7. Digital  Twin Data  Governance Framework  
At the heart of the DT, is the data collection, curation, 
management, analysis as well as output of data (Figure 8). 
Since  DT information  can be viewed  as the high-end utility  of 
all the data sets, a strong  data foundation  is necessary.  To this 
end, a robust data foundation is underpinned by a strong data 
governance2 and data management3 strategy (see Plotkin,  
 
 
 
2 Data  governance  is the formal  oversight,  execution  and enforcement  of authority  over the management  of data. 
3 Data  management  is the effective  management  of data to achieve  goals  i.e. it ensures  that an organization  gets value  out of its data while  minimizing  operating  risk.

Figure  9 Data  domains  (Source:  Khatri  and Brown,  2010)  
 
2020;  Conarado,  2014).  In the context  of DT, the four decision 
domains of data governance reported in Khatri and Brown, 
(2010) are appropriate. Thus, a data governance framework 
could comprise; a) data principles (at the top) which are 
intended to establish the direction for all other decision 
domains, and set the boundary requirements for uses of data 
assets, thereby addressing standards for data quality; b) the 
data quality then determines how data are interpreted 
(metadata) as well as accessed (data access) by users; and c) 
the data life -cycle decision which defines the production, 
retention and retirement of data assets (Alhassan et al., 2016).  
The aim of the DT for river basin management could be seen 
as the exhaustive capture of all physical environment 
parameters which are often intrinsically linked to aspects of 
people's  lives, and intellectual property. Determining how  this 
information is shared between organizations and individuals 
will naturally require some data sharing policy (Jones et al., 
2020).  This even  more  so when  referring  to both physical  and 
virtual  entities - to what  extent  does DT data ownership  go? As 
a result, the question  of ownership encompasses who accesses 
the data and for what purpose. As reported in Jones et. al., 
(2020), there are social and cultural implications associated 
with the large -scale collection, storage, and sharing of data 
through the Digital Twin that need to be fully addressed 
through a data governance framework.  
While co -designed data governance framework could 
accelerate  access  and use of data and services  of the DT, the 
following key challenges ought to be overcome;  a) Cataloguing  for all the available  data collected  by 
separate  and distinct  scientists  and/or  institutions,  
b) Understanding  the data in the proper  context  and the need 
to link similar data sets together,  
c) Akin to many sectors such as financial services, retail, 
and healthcare companies, there may be a lack of 
resources  (e.g.,  data stewards)  to curate  and maintain  the 
quality of the data.  
 
8. Digital  Twin  for River  Basins Applications  
8.1. Digital  Twin  for decision  making  at the river  basin - 
level 
The utility  of DT applications  at basin  level  lies in the inherent 
adaptive capability wherein the near -real time river basin 
processes will be captured. As a result, any reactive measures 
(including  plausible  futures)  lead to improved  efficiency  of the 
basin operations, optimized uncertainty measures, early 
warning  detection  and generally  good  emergency  management 
(Pal et al., 2023). These salient features are supported by 
embedding AI algorithms with the DT architecture. The AI  
has the capability of providing additional insights beyond  
what the sensors provide t","10468"

[INPUT_TEXT]","o1-mini","Environment","Development of a Digital Twin for water resources management in the Limpopo River Basin in southern Africa Water resource management in any basin, like the Limpopo River Basin with its intermittent supplies, is complex due to factors like rainfall, water allocation, quality, ecosystems, and risk to citizens. Balancing these factors often exceeds most managers' capabilities, despite the existence of numerous data sets. 
This project aims to develop a Digital Twin, a real-time, data-backed digital replica of the ground situation. Enhanced with machine learning and AI, it will integrate available data and models, providing easy and intuitive access to information. Grounded in real data, its outputs will be of tangible value, making it indispensable to water resource managers once fully developed.

The effective and efficient water resource conservation and management necessary to mitigate the crisis requires monitoring data, especially on water quality. This is recognized by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, particularly indicator 6.3.2., which requires all UN member states to measure and report the ‘proportion of water bodies with good ambient water quality’. However, gathering sufficient data on water quality is reliant on data collection at spatial and temporal scales that are generally outside the capacity of institutions using conventional methods. Digital technologies, such as wireless sensor networks and remote sensing, have come to the fore as promising avenues to increase the scope of data collection and reporting. Citizen science (which goes by many names, e.g., participatory science or community-based monitoring) has also been earmarked as a powerful mechanism to improve monitoring. However, both avenues have drawbacks and limitations. The synergy between the strengths of modern technologies and citizen science presents an opportunity to use the best features of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the other. This paper briefly synthesizes recent research illustrating how smartphones, sometimes in conjunction with other sensors, present a nexus point method for citizen scientists to engage with and use sophisticated modern technology for water quality monitoring. This paper also presents a brief, non-exhaustive research synthesis of some examples of current technological upgrades or innovations regarding smartphones in citizen science water quality monitoring in developing countries and how these can assist in objective, comprehensive, and improved data collection, management and reporting. While digital innovations are being rapidly developed worldwide, there remains a paucity of scientific and socioeconomic validation of their suitability and usefulness within citizen science. This perhaps contributes to the fact that the uptake and upscaling of smartphone-assisted citizen science continues to underperform compared to its potential within water resource management and SDG reporting. Ultimately, we recommend that more rigorous scientific research efforts be dedicated to exploring the suitability of digital innovations in citizen science in the context of developing countries and SDG reporting.

1. Background  
Natural  systems are  inherently  complex  webs  of interconnected 
components that encompass environment, ecosystems, and 
numerous earth system processes operating at scales. Human 
activities and their iterations with these systems make them 
more complex leading to several intended and unintended 
consequences with dynamic feedback loops. While these 
complexities have always existed, these have increased due to 
the recent  technological  explosion  (Sargut  and McGrath,  2011). 
As averred by Sargut and McGrath (2011), the complexity has 
gone from something found in large confined systems, such as 
factories  and cities, to remote environments  such as entire river 
basins. The non -linear effects and dynamic feedback loops  from the natural systems and their human interactions are 
making it harder to predict what will happen because they 
interact  in unexpected ways  and are difficult  to manage.  This is 
especially true where reliable data are not easily accessible.  
River basins are complex natural systems where human 
activities imparted profound influence on water, land, 
ecosystems, and climate patterns. There is no doubt that the 
management of the water resources of a basin is a complex 
issue due to the inherent interplay  of the changing environment 
(Bernhardt et al., 2006; Cosgrove and Loucks, 2015; Leb et  al., 
2018; Young and Harshadeep, 2020). River basin ecosystems 
provide  water  resources  for agriculture,  livestock,  and fisheries, 
industry and for domestic use, sustaining the livelihoods of

Figure  1 A simple  representation  of Digital  Twin  (Jones  et al., 2020)  
 
millions  of people  in the region.  Nonetheless,  these  river  basin 
ecosystems are also subject to hydroclimatic extremes, land 
degradation, poor water quality, urbanization and population 
growth. These environmental shifts not only pose a threat to 
the rich biodiversity in river basins but also weaken the 
resilience of local communities to climate change (Fazey et  
al., 2021; Carmen et al, 2022).  
To effectively manage these complex natural systems 
impacted by human activities, there is a need to leverage 
technological advancements such as high -performance 
computing,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  and real-time database 
management  systems.  The DT concept  is an advanced  version 
of traditional Decision Support Systems (DSS) used to 
manage water resources and environmental processes in river 
basin ecosystems. By utilizing new generation sensors, big 
data, cloud processing and AI, a digital representation of the 
river basin is created, providing a dynamic framework that 
offers comprehensive information for effective management.  
A DT is a rapidly emerging concept that digitally depicts an 
object, a process, or a system (Grieves, 2014; Ademenko et  
al., 2020 and references therein). Grieves and Vickers (2004) 
pioneered the work of DT and presented a DT framework as 
comprising three components, a physical object, a digital 
representation of that object, and the bi -directional data 
connections that feed data from the physical to the digital 
representation, and information and processes from  the digital 
representation  to the physical  (Figure  1). DT has the capability 
of accelerating innovation (e.g., improved modelling of  
system changes or optimized business supply chains) if 
coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT) or AI (Jones et al., 
2020).  
A review  of DT literature by  Jones  et al. (2020)  demonstrated 
increased interest in recent years across both academia and 
industry as seen in the growth in the number of related 
publications,  processes,  concepts,  and envisaged  benefits.  In a 
bid to determine if DT could be used in the Nature -based 
Solutions (NbS) for stormwater and transboundary water  security projects, the existing conceptual challenges and the 
DT definition as a framework were examined (Brasil et al., 
2022). They identified how the mathematical modelling 
reported in the literature could improve the DT development, 
and evaluated the potential benefits associated with the 
application of DT in NbS. Noting the sparse presence of DT 
applications in water resource management and in particular 
river basin management, the present review aims to a)  
establish the role of AI techniques such as machine learning, 
deep learning, and data analytics in enhancing the predictive 
and decision -making capabilities of digital twins, b) compile 
information about existing DT applications in developing 
countries,  c) assess  the DT infrastructure,  architecture  and data 
governance frameworks, and d) characterize the relevant DT 
use cases for river basin management. This review contributes 
towards developing a robust conceptual framework for an 
operational Limpopo River Basin DT.  
2. Literature  Review  
The era of digital technologies capable of transforming the 
livelihoods of developing country populace is now more 
obvious. Yet the inherent core pillars including the digital 
infrastructure, human capital and enabling environment, 
continue to act as impediments to these countries’ massive 
digital ecosystem potential that is hugely needed for socio - 
economic equitable growth (Union, 2020). Juxtaposing the 
role that water sensitive sectors  play in support  of advancing 
economic  growth,  socio - and gender  equity  and creating  jobs 
under changing climate, this underscores the value of  digital 
innovation ecosystem in the context of water resource 
management (Shilin et al., 2021; Józefowicz et al., 2023).

Figure 3 Trends of research themes. Upper -right quadrant are the motor themes (hot topics); themes appearing in the  upper -left quadrant are considered very spe - 
cialized  topics -niche  themes;  the lower  right  are termed basic  themes;  emerging  or declining  themes  are generally  weakly  developed,  have  low density,  low central - 
ity and are either emerging or disappearing.  
 
Fortunately,  our world  is abuzz  with disruptive  technologies 
that are transforming  the way  we respond to the  present  and 
future challenges. The digital transformation strategy for 
Africa (2020 -2030), avers that;  
“Africa presents a sea of economic opportunities in 
virtually every sector, and the continent’s youthful 
population structure is an enormous opportunity in 
this digital  era and hence  the need  for Africa  to make 
digitally  enabled  socio -economic  development  a high 
priority.”  
Against  the backdrop  of the digital  transformation  strategy  for 
Africa, there is need to ameliorate the unique challenges of 
adoption of digital technologies across Africa. There is no 
doubt that the new technologies and approaches for 
digitalizing and smartening water systems through Big Data, 
algorithm  development  and Artificial  Intelligence  (using  Deep  & Machine Learning) are increasingly being recognized 
globally. While Digital Agriculture & Digital Water 
Innovations (hereafter DA -DW-I) have a global footprint, 
arguments  for their impact  and developmental  implications  are 
generally subtle in the global South (e.g., Amankwa et al., 
2021).

Figure  4 Content  analysis  of Digital  Twin  scholarship  in Africa  (Source:  Authors)  
 
Peer-reviewed published literature on DT and river basin 
management in scientific databases (e.g., Scopus and Web of 
Science (WoS)), illustrates that the global DT scholarship on 
river basin management is generally a nascent research  
agenda. This evidence is illustrated by more than 12 years of 
publications given in Figure 2, wherein the majority of the 
scientific  articles  focusing  on DT only emerge  in the past three 
years. There were 41 peer -reviewed scientific publications on  
 
Table  2 Nature  of country  collaboration  on the DT publications  in Africa  DT with river basin references. In terms of the research 
interests across countries, the review analysis suggests that 
China  and South  African  researchers  are at the forefront,  albeit 
surprisingly lacking collaboration as most publications focus 
on single country (Table 1). In terms of emerging themes in  
the DT research domain, the review established that there are 
subtle hot topics (upper right), very specialized (upper left) as 
well as basic (lower right) and emerging (lower left) research 
themes as depicted in  Figure 3. The evolution of the research 
themes from a global perspective is expected to change as the 
direction of DT scholarship changes in future.  
In reviewing published literature on DT in Africa, few key 
words were used i.e., “Digital Twin” and “Africa” and the 
search kept to “within” abstracts only.  Only nineteen articles 
(17 from Scopus and 2 from WoS) were extracted that had 
some  content  on DT. A quick  analysis  of the trends,  and social

networks of the DT scholarship illustrated that the scientific 
discourse only emerged in databases considered from 2018 
(only one article) with most articles published in 2023 (7 
seven  articles).  Seven  peer reviewed  scientific  publications  on 
DT (where river basin management is also mentioned) were 
published between 2020 and 2022. The composition of the 
article types illustrated that most of the DT research has 
mostly  appeared  in scientific  conferences,  while  five, two, and 
four appeared in Journals, Book Chapters and Reviews 
respectively.  The nature of publication collaborations by 
country, Table 2, illustrates that DT scholars from South 
Africa and the United Kingdom exhibit both single and 
multiple country publications while France, Germany and 
Morocco have single country publications. To understand the 
research direction or applications of DT in Africa, Figure 4 
shows the content analysis of abstracts of the 17 reviewed 
articles. Though research on DT in the African continent is 
still at it’s infancy, content analysis results of the reviewed 
articles given in Figure 4 bring forth three main research 
directions,  i.e., methodology, applications  and use. It however 
important to note that these results are not exhaustive at this 
stage.  
Smart City  and Digital Twin City  are new novel methods of 
city management  being  implemented  worldwide,  in response 
to the expansion  of cities  and megacities  in the current  era of technology  disruption,  rapid  urbanization  and climate  change. 
For instance, in 2021, the University of Pretoria announced 
the creation of Hatfield Digital Twin City, a novel initiative  
that aims to boost service delivery with the help of smart 
technology (Figure 5).  
A literature  search  of smart  city applications  of DT in  the 
African continent resulted to only the following notable 
publications:  
a) Nigerian  Electricity  Supply  Industry  (NESI): Aliyu et  al. 
(2021)  analyzed  the NESI  framework  and concluded  that 
the system uses a novel framework that is premised on a 
SoS and digital twins.  
b) Broekman  and Steyn  (2022)  reported  on Digital  Twinning 
of Lap -based Marathon Infrastructure: the digitization of 
the marathon route using Real -Time Kinematic Global 
Navigation Satellite Systems (RTK GNSS) and high - 
density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensing 
capabilities to allow for the detailed geometry 
measurements and environmental analysis before and  
after such events. They concluded that the intersection of 
engineering and sports disciplines and technology 
illustrates the potential realization of smart cities and 
recreation in an evolutionary society.

3. Digital  Twins  and Virtual  Reality  
In the rapidly advancing technological era we inhabit,  it is 
advantageous to critically evaluate the functionalities and 
applicability  of immersive and interactive digital technologies 
such as Virtual  Reality  (VR)  to sectors  which  impact  our well- 
being and quality of life in sectors such as agriculture and 
water management. Furthermore, it is important to explore 
how these  emergent  technologies  like VR can shape  and guide  decision making in water resources management, aid in risk 
management  and accelerate  technology  usage.  This will result 
in the generation of innovative technology -based solutions 
toward solving river basin challenges to ameliorate humanity 
and the sustainability of food and water resources.  
Gigante (1993) defines VR as being “characterized by the 
illusion of participation in a synthetic environment than 
external  observation  of such an environment.  It relies  on three - 
dimensional, stereoscopic, head -tracked displays, hand/body 
tracking, and binaural sound”. Additionally, VR may be 
delineated as an immersive, multisensory experience ( Holuša, 
et al., 2023; Azarby, & Rice, 2022). It is also referred to as 
providing virtual environments, virtual worlds, or 
microworlds. A journal titled, Development of a Digital Twin 
for smart farming: Irrigation management system for water

 saving  asserts  that the “digital  twin applied  to agriculture  is in 
its early stages of development”. It further defines a digital 
twin as an entity where “data flows automatically and in both 
directions between a physical object and a virtual  
object” (Alves, Maia & Lima, 2023). It is imperative to note 
that the adoption of these technologies is in an experimental 
phase and the consolidation of two or more technologies such 
as DT and VR is an even more recently employed practice. A 
literature  review  on the linkages  between  VR and DT revealed 
an interesting pattern of these two concepts. The concepts of 
VR and DT seems to have appeared only in the last two 
decades  (based  on the Scopus  and WoS  databases).  According 
to the two databases, 857 articles (comprising of largely 
journal articles -50%; and conference papers -25%). Most of  
the scholarship only emerged post -2018. In terms of the 
linkages between DT, VR and Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Figure  6 illustrates  detailed  interconnections  between  the three 
concepts and other antecedent terminologies. As shown in 
Figure 6, there are intrinsic interlinkages between these three 
concepts  and other  concepts  such as data analytics,  augmented 
reality, machine learning – all related to advanced 
computational techniques.  
There are a host of possibilities for the application of 
technologies such as DT and VR to actively address water 
management concerns specific to river basins in developing 
African  countries.  The unique  characteristics  DT and VR offer 
respectively  and when  combined provide  useful  real-time data 
to allow  for the continuous monitoring of river basins. Firstly, 
DT and VR offer accessible realistic digital visualizations 
which enable integrated river basin modelling. While DT 
establishes a real -time virtual representation of the river basin 
presenting water flow, dam operations, pollution sources and 
other environmental elements, VR allows for the visual 
navigation of the DT model and permits interactivity where 
users may directly impact the virtual environment they are 
visiting using their senses including sight, touch, smell and 
hearing to observe the real -time condition of river basins.  
River basins play a pivotal role in supplying fresh water and 
regulating water flow and quality. A DT and VR 
collaboratively  may be used to monitor the physical condition 
of the river basins. The DT will provide the data analytics 
required while VR will allow scientists and engineers to 
conduct virtual inspections and assessments eliminating the 
need for them to be physically present. Lastly, in the case of 
water  crises  such as droughts  or floods  the data extracted  from  the DT can  be analysed  to predict  heavy  rainfalls  that may 
cause  floods  or increased  evapotranspiration  and the over- 
extraction of ground water that may cause droughts.  
Concurrently,  VR can be employed  to pre-visualize  droughts 
and floods  before  they occur  to implement  prevention  tactics 
or mitigate the impact if inevitable.  
An exemplary  case study where DT and VR has been  utilized 
cooperatively  to combat  agricultural  related  challenges  can be 
seen through AgroIT, a company that provides technological 
solutions for the agricultural sector, particularly focusing on 
precision agriculture. AgroIT's platform uses Digital Twin 
technology to create a virtual representation of farmlands, 
incorporating data like soil conditions, weather, and crop 
health. On the VR front, they have explored its use for 
visualizing these digital farms. This combination allows 
farmers to virtually 'walk' through their fields, visualize 
potential problem areas, and make informed decisions about 
irrigation, fertilization and other operations1. 
The ambitions  of DT and VR for environmental  application in 
developing countries based on its previous uses are to aid in 
water resource management systems. This one day may be as 
advanced as integrated user interfaces. Virtual reality is also 
known as an ‘empathy machine’ because of its unique ability 
to immerse users in emotionally charged perspectives, 
experiences, and environments which may prompt positive 
actions  and behaviors  in real life. Through  the advancement  of 
brain -computer interfaces users might control DT simulations 
or navigate VR environments using their thoughts. This could 
lead to more intuitive user experiences and might even allow 
for emotion -driven simulations, where users can ""feel"" the 
impacts of different river management decisions. DT and VR 
technologies strategically locate themselves at the heart of 
digital innovation as solution -based methods that directly 
address the need for visual representations to accurately 
measure the state of water, food and land conditions within 
various  regions  susceptible to food and water wastage, natural 
disasters and shortages. Researchers and scientists look 
forward to the progression of these technologies and the 
problems they will solve in the water management sector. A 
consideration of the manner we orient and define DT and VR 
as their operations evolve and their capacity expands will be 
essential to the integration and assimilation of these ever - 
changing digital innovations.

4. Stakeholder  Needs  Assessment  
DT models are anchored on data from various life cycle 
phases that ought to be collected and analyzed to deliver 
services to a myriad of stakeholders. The utility of the DT 
services is dependent on the level of alignment with 
stakeholder needs. In order ensure uptake of the DT services, 
there  is need  to undertake  stakeholder  engagement  through  the 
development phases of the DT design and implementation.  
Stakeholders are defined as all groups and individuals who 
influence the aims of an organization, project or product and 
vice versa (Freeman and McVea, 2005). As part of  
stakeholder analysis, the stakeholders, their interests and their 
characteristics are identified. This is followed by clustering 
and prioritization  of the stakeholders.  After  analysis,  a strategy 
and recommended actions can be defined (Ramirez, 1999).  
From the DT design and implementation perspective, a 
stakeholder typology reported in Mitchael et al., (1997) as 
well as stakeholder identification based on the interest - 
influence matrix  reported in  e.g., Janssens  de Bisthoven  et al., 
(2022) should be considered. All the DT use cases relevant to 
river -based  management  presented  in Section  7.2, undertook  a 
well-designed iterative stakeholder engagement process  
during the design and implementation of the DT.  
5. 3D Representation  of a River  Basin  Digital 
Twin  
The emergence  of digital  twin technology  has revolutionized 
several fields,  from  manufacturing  to urban  planning  (Tao  et 
al., 2018).  The application  of this innovative  concept  to river basin management using the 3D Representation provides a 
compelling overview of the potential benefits and challenges 
faced.  A river  basin,  being  a complex  system  with a myriad of 
interrelated components such as water flow, sediment 
transport, vegetation, and human interventions, necessitates a 
robust modeling approach. The three -dimensional 
representation in the mentioned work provides a vivid and 
detailed visualization of these elements, making it an 
invaluable tool for stakeholders.  
6. Data  Infrastructure  Architecture  for a Digital 
Twin  
The envisioned  DT architecture  is often  characterized  by two 
main  typologies  - monitoring  and predictive  DT as  described 
in Figure 7. The monitoring typology  represents the past and 
present dynamics of the physical and social -economic 
properties and interactions with the hydroclimatic 
environment, where a virtual representation is created using 
this data. From the perspective of predictive typology, 
predictive models will use past and present data to create a 
plausible future rendition of the present state of the 
environment.  
As reported  in Brasil  et al. (2022)  and Dhulipala  (2021),  a DT 
conceptual framework comprises the components briefly 
described below (also see Figure 8):  
a) Data  source  layer:  to accurately  represent  the LRB  in a 
digital space, various data sets will be required. These 
data sets ought to represent not only the physical

Figure  8 The physical  environment,  data storage,  digital  environment  and applications  services  of the Digital  Twin  (Adapted  from  Brasil  et al., 2022)  
 
environment but also the biological and chemical 
conditions of the basin. Some of the data sources may 
include, remotely sensed data -from satellites and/or 
drones, hydrological process model data, ground 
observations (e.g., water quality/proxy measurements, 
weather  data,  mobile  app captured  data sets),  and thirty 
party datasets which are often analysis ready (e.g., 
climatic data from  the Digital Earth Africa platform  or 
non-climatic datasets  from  the National Department of 
Statistics).  
b) Data processing layer: One of the key functions of this 
layer is to pre -process and format the various data sets to 
ensure inter -operability among the various strands of the 
data. In addition, this layer executes a set of data 
modelling functions including hydrological process 
modelling, climate data downscaling and bias correction, 
satellite image classing to derive various product 
including  hydroclimatic  extremes  and irrigated  area maps.  
c) Data visualization and analytic layer: Based on the 
outputs  in b), this layer  comprises  GIS-enabled  analytic  tools embedded with dashboards to display various user 
selected features. Some of the key  outputs from  this layer 
would be the early warning messages that denote 
hydroclimatic  extremes,  risk areas  and the general  state of 
the river basin.  
d) Advisory and dissemination layer: this layer is a rule 
engine  embedded  decision  support  rule system  that helps 
provide intelligent management options suited for the 
present  and future  physical  state of the river  basin.  These 
decisions are often disseminated using channels such as 
SMS/USSD, web and mobile applications, and even 
tower broadcasts once the system is implemented.  
7. Digital  Twin Data  Governance Framework  
At the heart of the DT, is the data collection, curation, 
management, analysis as well as output of data (Figure 8). 
Since  DT information  can be viewed  as the high-end utility  of 
all the data sets, a strong  data foundation  is necessary.  To this 
end, a robust data foundation is underpinned by a strong data 
governance2 and data management3 strategy (see Plotkin,  
 
 
 
2 Data  governance  is the formal  oversight,  execution  and enforcement  of authority  over the management  of data. 
3 Data  management  is the effective  management  of data to achieve  goals  i.e. it ensures  that an organization  gets value  out of its data while  minimizing  operating  risk.

Figure  9 Data  domains  (Source:  Khatri  and Brown,  2010)  
 
2020;  Conarado,  2014).  In the context  of DT, the four decision 
domains of data governance reported in Khatri and Brown, 
(2010) are appropriate. Thus, a data governance framework 
could comprise; a) data principles (at the top) which are 
intended to establish the direction for all other decision 
domains, and set the boundary requirements for uses of data 
assets, thereby addressing standards for data quality; b) the 
data quality then determines how data are interpreted 
(metadata) as well as accessed (data access) by users; and c) 
the data life -cycle decision which defines the production, 
retention and retirement of data assets (Alhassan et al., 2016).  
The aim of the DT for river basin management could be seen 
as the exhaustive capture of all physical environment 
parameters which are often intrinsically linked to aspects of 
people's  lives, and intellectual property. Determining how  this 
information is shared between organizations and individuals 
will naturally require some data sharing policy (Jones et al., 
2020).  This even  more  so when  referring  to both physical  and 
virtual  entities - to what  extent  does DT data ownership  go? As 
a result, the question  of ownership encompasses who accesses 
the data and for what purpose. As reported in Jones et. al., 
(2020), there are social and cultural implications associated 
with the large -scale collection, storage, and sharing of data 
through the Digital Twin that need to be fully addressed 
through a data governance framework.  
While co -designed data governance framework could 
accelerate  access  and use of data and services  of the DT, the 
following key challenges ought to be overcome;  a) Cataloguing  for all the available  data collected  by 
separate  and distinct  scientists  and/or  institutions,  
b) Understanding  the data in the proper  context  and the need 
to link similar data sets together,  
c) Akin to many sectors such as financial services, retail, 
and healthcare companies, there may be a lack of 
resources  (e.g.,  data stewards)  to curate  and maintain  the 
quality of the data.  
 
8. Digital  Twin  for River  Basins Applications  
8.1. Digital  Twin  for decision  making  at the river  basin - 
level 
The utility  of DT applications  at basin  level  lies in the inherent 
adaptive capability wherein the near -real time river basin 
processes will be captured. As a result, any reactive measures 
(including  plausible  futures)  lead to improved  efficiency  of the 
basin operations, optimized uncertainty measures, early 
warning  detection  and generally  good  emergency  management 
(Pal et al., 2023). These salient features are supported by 
embedding AI algorithms with the DT architecture. The AI  
has the capability of providing additional insights beyond  
what the sensors provide t","10468"

Thirdly, this paper situates MSPs within the CGIAR’s MSPs’ broader community of practice to draw further common threads across different contexts, different resources and across different scales. The early findings demonstrate that it is possible to engage women and youths in the designing, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the MSPs.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.

The wild relatives of this crop are deemed a vast potential source of useful alleles to adapt to this stress. A nested association mapping (NAM) panel was generated using as a recurrent parent the Moroccan variety ‘Nachit’ derived from Triticum dicoccoides and known for its large grain size. This was recombined to three top-performing lines derived from T. dicoccoides, T. araraticum, and Aegilops speltoides, for a total of 426 inbred progenies. This NAM was evaluated across eight environments (Syria, Lebanon, and Morocco) experiencing different degrees of terminal moisture stress over two crop seasons. Our results showed that drought stress caused on average 41% loss in yield and that 1,000-kernel weight (TKW) was the most important trait for adaptation to it. Genotyping with the 25K TraitGenetics array resulted in a consensus map of 1,678 polymorphic SNPs, spanning 1,723 cM aligned to the reference ‘Svevo’ genome assembly. Kinship distinguished the progenies in three clades matching the parent of origin. A total of 18 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified as controlling various traits but independent from flowering time. The most significant genomic regions were named Q.ICD.NAM-04, Q.ICD.NAM-14, and Q.ICD.NAM-16. Allelic investigation in a second germplasm panel confirmed that carrying the positive allele at all three loci produced an average TKW advantage of 25.6% when field-tested under drought conditions. The underlying SNPs were converted to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers and successfully validated in a third germplasm set, where they explained up to 19% of phenotypic variation for TKW under moisture stress. These findings confirm the identification of critical loci for drought adaptation derived from wild relatives that can now be readily exploited via molecular breeding.

Integrated Agriculture-Aquaculture (IAA) systems are diversified farming systems where aquatic and terrestrial foods are grown together on the same plot using the resources from one to benefit the other. In Egypt, for example, the production of fish such as Nile tilapia, mullet, and African catfish creates nutrient-rich water that can then be used to irrigate crops such as date palm, olives, figs, pomegranates, guava, onions, sugar beets, and tomato.

important approach for sustainable development. Recommended innovations include the following:
• Help stakeholders use information communication technology (ICT), smart sensing and the internet of
things (IOT) for optimal use of resources.
• Adopt hybrid water management in the fish farm component of IAA by using both the flow-through
system, partial recirculating aquaculture system (PRAS) and the recirculating aquaculture system (RAS)
based on the requirements for crop irrigation.
• Support product network marketing and establish IAA pilot farms as demonstration farms for private
farmers so that they can learn how to manage IAA systems.
• Help farmers learn how to adopt new techniques through applied research, training, interactions and
shared knowledge.

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o","Environment","Automated in-season rice crop mapping using Sentinel time-series data and Google Earth Engine: A case study in climate-risk prone Bangladesh High-resolution mapping of rice fields is crucial for understanding and managing rice cultivation in countries like Bangladesh, particularly in the face of climate change. Rice is a vital crop, cultivated in small scale farms that contributes significantly to the economy and food security in Bangladesh. Accurate mapping can facilitate improved rice production, the development of sustainable agricultural management policies, and formulation of strategies for adapting to climatic risks. To address the need for timely and accurate rice mapping, we developed a framework specifically designed for the diverse environmental conditions in Bangladesh. We utilized Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series data to identify transplantation and peak seasons and employed the multi-Otsu automatic thresholding approach to map rice during the peak season (April–May). We also compared the performance of a random forest (RF) classifier with the multi-Otsu approach using two different data combinations: D1, which utilizes data from the transplantation and peak seasons (D1 RF) and D2, which utilizes data from the transplantation to the harvest seasons (D2 RF). Our results demonstrated that the multi-Otsu approach achieved an overall classification accuracy (OCA) ranging from 61.18% to 94.43% across all crop zones. The D2 RF showed the highest mean OCA (92.15%) among the fourteen crop zones, followed by D1 RF (89.47%) and multi-Otsu (85.27%). Although the multi-Otsu approach had relatively lower OCA, it proved effective in accurately mapping rice areas prior to harvest, eliminating the need for training samples that can be challenging to obtain during the growing season. In-season rice area maps generated through this framework are crucial for timely decision-making regarding adaptive management in response to climatic stresses and forecasting area-wide productivity. The scalability of our framework across space and time makes it particularly suitable for addressing field data scarcity challenges in countries like Bangladesh and offers the potential for future operationalization.

We also compared the performance of a random forest (RF) classifier with the multi-Otsu approach using two different data combinations: D1, which utilizes data from the transplantation and peak seasons (D1 RF) and D2, which utilizes data from the transplantation to the harvest seasons (D2 RF). Our results demonstrated that the multi-Otsu approach achieved an overall classification accuracy (OCA) ranging from 61.18% to 94.43% across all crop zones. The D2 RF showed the highest mean OCA (92.15%) among the fourteen crop zones, followed by D1 RF (89.47%) and multi-Otsu (85.27%). Although the multi-Otsu approach had relatively lower OCA, it proved effective in accurately mapping rice areas prior to harvest, eliminating the need for training samples that can be challenging to obtain during the growing season. In-season rice area maps generated through this framework are crucial for timely decision-making regarding adaptive management in response to climatic stresses and forecasting area-wide productivity. The scalability of our framework across space and time makes it particularly suitable for addressing field data scarcity challenges in countries like Bangladesh and offers the potential for future operationalization.

Balancing Food Security, Nutrition, 
and Sustainability: Evaluating 
Diverse Cropping Patterns
Comparing diversified cropping 
patterns in Dinajpur, Bangladesh
ABOUT  THIS  BRIEF
This  research  brief  summarizes results  from a cropping  systems diversification  
experiment  after  the first complete  cropping  cycle . The trial has been  established by 
the Bangladesh Wheat  and Maize  Research  Institute  (BWMRI)  in collaboration  with  the 
Transforming  Agrifood  Systems  in South  Asia  (TAFSSA) Initiative  in Dinajpur,  
Bangladesh in August  2022.  
PRELIMINARY  FINDINGS
1.After the first full cropping cycle (three seasons within one year) we observed 
that all diversified cropping systems outperform the most common farmer 
practice in terms of rice equivalent yields (REY), sometimes up to up to 30% more.
2.Nutritional yields of vitamin A and vitamin C can be increased by adding leafy 
vegetables during the winter rabi  season as a replacement of fallows between 
two rice crops or as maize intercrops.
3.An added leafy vegetable crop between two rice crops is among the best 
performing cropping patterns from a monetary and a nutritional point of view. However, given the high amount of irrigation water needed for boro  (winter rice), 
the environmental impact of this cropping pattern remains questionable.
BACKGROUND
The average  cropping  intensity  in Bangladesh stands  at 200%, with  five out of the 316 
identified  cropping  patterns  primarily  centered  on rice,  constituting  51% of net copped 
area (Nasim  et al., 2018 ). While  this approach  may  contribute  to food  security,  
particularly with  regards  to the nation's  primary staple  crop,  it falls  short  in addressing  
the issue  of malnutrition . Progress  toward  achieving  global nutrition  targets  remains  
limited  (Global  Nutrition  Report,  2021 ). Moreover,  environmental  challenges,  such  as 
climate  change,  excessive  groundwater  depletion,  biodiversity  loss,  and environmental  
quality  concerns,  necessitates  a focused  commitment  to ensuring  agricultural  
sustainability . To address  these  complex  issues,  this research  trial seeks  to evaluate  
diversified  cropping  patterns,  considering  their  potential  for increased  production,  
nutritional  yields,  profitability,  and environmental  impact variables .Research Note 19 November 2023

2013 . (2) Production  cost  includes  all measured  costs  for seed,  fertilizer,  irrigation,  pesticides  / 
insecticides  / herbicides  used  and labor for all operations . Not included  is land  rent,  which  
however  for farmers  can be substantial,  but is nonetheless  uniform  across  treatments .
2OBJECTIVES 
This  research  aims  to discern  strategies  
that can augment  farmers'  profits  and 
nutritional  yields,  while  concurrently  
preserving  resources  and safeguarding  
or enhancing  ecological  services . The 
diverse  crop  patterns  chosen for study  
were  identified  therough  participatory  
research  with  stakeholders  in the study  
area prioritizing  production  needs . 
Additionally,  this research  seeks  to 
address  the mitigation  of greenhouse  
gas emissions originating  from  farms  
and agricultural  landscapes . Preliminary  
results  from  the first year  of crop  
rotations  are described  in this research  
brief .
DATA AND METHODS
The trial follows  a randomized  complete  
block  design,  with  nine  treatments  
(Table  1) replicated three  times . Plot  sizes  
are 17 m x 11.5 m. Treatments  4 and 5 
include  split  plots  for different  leafy  
vegetables  (spinach,  red amaranth (lal 
shak ), coriander  and napa shak) . 
Agronomic  data,  all above  ground  
biomass  crop  production,  costs  of all 
inputs  including  labor  and the amount  
of irrigation  water  applied are among  
the data  collected  (for more  information  
see Cheesman et al., 2022) .To allow  yield  comparison  between  
different  crops,  rice equivalent  yield  
(REY)  was used  (eq. 1).Nutritional yield  
(NY),  as a measure  of nutritional  value  of 
the production,  is calculated  for 
nutrients  (protein,  fat, carbohydrates),  
iron  and zinc,  as well  as Vitamin  A and 
(Eq. 2). Profitability  is assessed  by 
calculating  net income  for each crop  
(Eq. 3). Data  have  been  computed for 
each of the three  main  cropping  seasons  
in Bangladesh (Kharif -2, Rabi , Kharif -1) 
and combined  to represent  the entire  
crop  rotation .

Aman  refers to rice grown in the monsoon Kharif -2 season; while boro  refers to rice grown in the winter Rabi  season.
* In the first Kharif -2 season, established in August 2022, each replicate was split lengthwise into two strips (8.5 m x 110 
m) and two biofortified rice varieties (BINA dhan  20 and BRRI dhan  72) were grown; BINA dhan  20 yield is reported in 
blue  while BRRI dhan  72 yield shown in red. Similarly, in the “total” column the two colors indicate the sum across the 
seasons considering the yields of BINA dhan  20 (blue )and BRRI dhan  72 (red), respectively .

PELIMINARY  RESULTS
Comparing  the traditional  rice-fallow -
rice cropping  pattern  (T1) to a slightly  
diversified  rice-leafy  vegetables -rice (T4) 
rotation,  we observe  an increase  in 
nutritional  yield,  especially  for vitamins  
and iron  (Figure  1). However,  REY  
increases  were  variable  (Table  1. 
Profitability  was is heavily  dependent on 
which leafy  vegetables  are grown   
(Figure  2), and are based on an assumed  
readily  available  market  for these  
otherwise  rapidly  perishable  products . 
Importantly,  labor  requirements  were  
only  slightly  increased  when adding  a 
leafy  vegetable  between  the two rice 
seasons  (Figure  2).
The second  most  common  cropping  
pattern  in the study  area,   rice -maize -
fallow  (T2), can be intensified  by adding  
a leafy  vegetable  intercrop  during  the 
maize  growing  phase  as well  as 
replacing  the fallow  period  with  a fodder  
crop,  in this case  sorghum  (T5). This  
improved  nutritional  yield,  largely  a 
consequence  of the additional  vegetable  
crop  (Figure  1). However,  maize  yields  
appear  to be negatively  affected  by the 
intercrop  (Table  1) and labor  needs  are 
strongly  increased  in T5 compared  to T2 
(Figure  2). Additional  calculations  are however  needed  to examine  maize  
yields  using  land  equivalency  ratios,  
which will be reported  on in the next  
research  note . Profitability  is heavily  
dependent on which  leafy  vegetable  is 
grown ; a maize  napa shak intercrop  
results  in higher  net income  compared  
to sole  maize  but the other  three  leafy  
vegetables  tested  as maize  intercrops  
initially  decrease net income  (Figure  2). 
During  Kharif -1, growing  sweetcorn  (T3) 
or groundnut  (T6) instead  of maize  (T7 or 
T9) increases  REY  (Table  1). This  is  
because  of higher  prices  for sweetcorn  
and groundnut . However,  further  
research  and market  development  will 
be needed  if these  crops  are to be widely  
grown  in the region . Similarly,  T7 (Aman -
Carrot -Maize) appears  to be more  
profitable  than  the common  farmers’  
practice  rotations  (T1 and T2). T7 did not 
require  more  labour  (Figure  2), though  
farmers’  feedback  in focus  groups  
highlighted  the need  to address  
marketing  challenges  for carrot . Lastly,  
net income  was calculated  using  local  
market  prices ; however  in reality  prices  
of vegetable  crops  may  be variable  even  
within  cropping  seasons . This  variability  
will be factored -in in future  calculations  
to obtain  more  accurate  profitability  
assessments.

RECOMMENDATION
The findings  presented  in this research  
brief  are derived  from  one full cropping  
cycle  conducted over  the course  of a 
year . These  initial  results  indicate  
differences  in productivity,  nutritional  
yields,  and profitability  among  the 
various  cropping  patterns . Nevertheless, 
it is premature  to formulate  definitive  
conclusions  at this stage . A more  
comprehensive  dataset spanning  
multiple  years  is requisite  for a more  
comprehensive  analysis  and results . 
Furthermore,  the assessment  of the 
environmental  footprint  associated  with  
each cropping  pattern  is yet to be 
finalized  and must  be factored in before  
making  recommendations  regarding  
the optimal  cropping  patterns .

Diverse Cropping Patterns
Comparing diversified cropping 
patterns in Dinajpur, Bangladesh
ABOUT  THIS  BRIEF
This  research  brief  summarizes results  from a cropping  systems diversification  
experiment  after  the first complete  cropping  cycle . The trial has been  established by 
the Bangladesh Wheat  and Maize  Research  Institute  (BWMRI)  in collaboration  with  the 
Transforming  Agrifood  Systems  in South  Asia  (TAFSSA) Initiative  in Dinajpur,  
Bangladesh in August  2022.  
PRELIMINARY  FINDINGS
1.After the first full cropping cycle (three seasons within one year) we observed 
that all diversified cropping systems outperform the most common farmer 
practice in terms of rice equivalent yields (REY), sometimes up to up to 30% more.
2.Nutritional yields of vitamin A and vitamin C can be increased by adding leafy 
vegetables during the winter rabi  season as a replacement of fallows between 
two rice crops or as maize intercrops.
3.An added leafy vegetable crop between two rice crops is among the best 
performing cropping patterns from a monetary and a nutritional point of view. However, given the high amount of irrigation water needed for boro  (winter rice), 
the environmental impact of this cropping pattern remains questionable.
BACKGROUND
The average  cropping  intensity  in Bangladesh stands  at 200%, with  five out of the 316 
identified  cropping  patterns  primarily  centered  on rice,  constituting  51% of net copped 
area (Nasim  et al., 2018 ). While  this approach  may  contribute  to food  security,  
particularly with  regards  to the nation's  primary staple  crop,  it falls  short  in addressing  
the issue  of malnutrition . Progress  toward  achieving  global nutrition  targets  remains  
limited  (Global  Nutrition  Report,  2021 ). Moreover,  environmental  challenges,  such  as 
climate  change,  excessive  groundwater  depletion,  biodiversity  loss,  and environmental  
quality  concerns,  necessitates  a focused  commitment  to ensuring  agricultural  
sustainability . To address  these  complex  issues,  this research  trial seeks  to evaluate  
diversified  cropping  patterns,  considering  their  potential  for increased  production,  
nutritional  yields,  profitability,  and environmental  impact variables .Research Note 19 November 2023

2013 . (2) Production  cost  includes  all measured  costs  for seed,  fertilizer,  irrigation,  pesticides  / 
insecticides  / herbicides  used  and labor for all operations . Not included  is land  rent,  which  
however  for farmers  can be substantial,  but is nonetheless  uniform  across  treatments .
2OBJECTIVES 
This  research  aims  to discern  strategies  
that can augment  farmers'  profits  and 
nutritional  yields,  while  concurrently  
preserving  resources  and safeguarding  
or enhancing  ecological  services . The 
diverse  crop  patterns  chosen for study  
were  identified  therough  participatory  
research  with  stakeholders  in the study  
area prioritizing  production  needs . 
Additionally,  this research  seeks  to 
address  the mitigation  of greenhouse  
gas emissions originating  from  farms  
and agricultural  landscapes . Preliminary  
results  from  the first year  of crop  
rotations  are described  in this research  
brief .
DATA AND METHODS
The trial follows  a randomized  complete  
block  design,  with  nine  treatments  
(Table  1) replicated three  times . Plot  sizes  
are 17 m x 11.5 m. Treatments  4 and 5 
include  split  plots  for different  leafy  
vegetables  (spinach,  red amaranth (lal 
shak ), coriander  and napa shak) . 
Agronomic  data,  all above  ground  
biomass  crop  production,  costs  of all 
inputs  including  labor  and the amount  
of irrigation  water  applied are among  
the data  collected  (for more  information  
see Cheesman et al., 2022) .To allow  yield  comparison  between  
different  crops,  rice equivalent  yield  
(REY)  was used  (eq. 1).Nutritional yield  
(NY),  as a measure  of nutritional  value  of 
the production,  is calculated  for 
nutrients  (protein,  fat, carbohydrates),  
iron  and zinc,  as well  as Vitamin  A and 
(Eq. 2). Profitability  is assessed  by 
calculating  net income  for each crop  
(Eq. 3). Data  have  been  computed for 
each of the three  main  cropping  seasons  
in Bangladesh (Kharif -2, Rabi , Kharif -1) 
and combined  to represent  the entire  
crop  rotation .

Aman  refers to rice grown in the monsoon Kharif -2 season; while boro  refers to rice grown in the winter Rabi  season.
* In the first Kharif -2 season, established in August 2022, each replicate was split lengthwise into two strips (8.5 m x 110 
m) and two biofortified rice varieties (BINA dhan  20 and BRRI dhan  72) were grown; BINA dhan  20 yield is reported in 
blue  while BRRI dhan  72 yield shown in red. Similarly, in the “total” column the two colors indicate the sum across the 
seasons considering the yields of BINA dhan  20 (blue )and BRRI dhan  72 (red), respectively .

PELIMINARY  RESULTS
Comparing  the traditional  rice-fallow -
rice cropping  pattern  (T1) to a slightly  
diversified  rice-leafy  vegetables -rice (T4) 
rotation,  we observe  an increase  in 
nutritional  yield,  especially  for vitamins  
and iron  (Figure  1). However,  REY  
increases  were  variable  (Table  1. 
Profitability  was is heavily  dependent on 
which leafy  vegetables  are grown   
(Figure  2), and are based on an assumed  
readily  available  market  for these  
otherwise  rapidly  perishable  products . 
Importantly,  labor  requirements  were  
only  slightly  increased  when adding  a 
leafy  vegetable  between  the two rice 
seasons  (Figure  2).
The second  most  common  cropping  
pattern  in the study  area,   rice -maize -
fallow  (T2), can be intensified  by adding  
a leafy  vegetable  intercrop  during  the 
maize  growing  phase  as well  as 
replacing  the fallow  period  with  a fodder  
crop,  in this case  sorghum  (T5). This  
improved  nutritional  yield,  largely  a 
consequence  of the additional  vegetable  
crop  (Figure  1). However,  maize  yields  
appear  to be negatively  affected  by the 
intercrop  (Table  1) and labor  needs  are 
strongly  increased  in T5 compared  to T2 
(Figure  2). Additional  calculations  are however  needed  to examine  maize  
yields  using  land  equivalency  ratios,  
which will be reported  on in the next  
research  note . Profitability  is heavily  
dependent on which  leafy  vegetable  is 
grown ; a maize  napa shak intercrop  
results  in higher  net income  compared  
to sole  maize  but the other  three  leafy  
vegetables  tested  as maize  intercrops  
initially  decrease net income  (Figure  2). 
During  Kharif -1, growing  sweetcorn  (T3) 
or groundnut  (T6) instead  of maize  (T7 or 
T9) increases  REY  (Table  1). This  is  
because  of higher  prices  for sweetcorn  
and groundnut . However,  further  
research  and market  development  will 
be needed  if these  crops  are to be widely  
grown  in the region . Similarly,  T7 (Aman -
Carrot -Maize) appears  to be more  
profitable  than  the common  farmers’  
practice  rotations  (T1 and T2). T7 did not 
require  more  labour  (Figure  2), though  
farmers’  feedback  in focus  groups  
highlighted  the need  to address  
marketing  challenges  for carrot . Lastly,  
net income  was calculated  using  local  
market  prices ; however  in reality  prices  
of vegetable  crops  may  be variable  even  
within  cropping  seasons . This  variability  
will be factored -in in future  calculations  
to obtain  more  accurate  profitability  
assessments.

no plot distinctions were made until after this first season 
(also see note at the bottom of Table 1).What  is nutritional yield : The nutritional  yield  of a specific  nutrient  refers  to the 
number  of adults  equivalents  who  can fulfil 100% of their  recommended  dietary  
refence intake  of that  nutrient  for an entire year  from the produce  of one 
hectare land  (DeFries  et al., 2015 ).

RECOMMENDATION
The findings  presented  in this research  
brief  are derived  from  one full cropping  
cycle  conducted over  the course  of a 
year . These  initial  results  indicate  
differences  in productivity,  nutritional  
yields,  and profitability  among  the 
various  cropping  patterns . Nevertheless, 
it is premature  to formulate  definitive  
conclusions  at this stage . A more  
comprehensive  dataset spanning  
multiple  years  is requisite  for a more  
comprehensive  analysis  and results . 
Furthermore,  the assessment  of the 
environmental  footprint  associated  with  
each cropping  pattern  is yet to be 
finalized  and must  be factored in before  
making  recommendations  regarding  
the optimal  cropping  patterns .

Sustainable development 
and management of a 
crucial natural resource 
A research protocol to model 
groundwater flow in Nalanda District, Bihar, India
BACKGROUND/CONTEXT
Across South  Asia,  millions  of small -scale  
farmers  are confronted  with  a range  of 
urgent  challenges . These  include  
poverty,  malnutrition,  environmental  
deterioration,  and the growing  impacts  
of climate  change  and unpredictability  
(Ericksen et al., 2011). Despite  these  
pressin g concerns,  the region’s  farming  
systems still have  potential  to 
sustainably  its productivity  and 
profitability  (Islam  et al., 2019 ; Gathala  et 
al., 2021 ). The Transforming  Agrifood  
Systems  in South  Asia  (TAFSSA) research  
integrates  interdisciplinary  studies  at 
both  the farm  and landscape  levels  to 
discover  approaches  that  enable  farmers  
to enhance  their  income  and nutritional  
output while  also  preserving  natural  
resources .
One  of the key high- priority  learning  
locations  in which TAFSSA  conducts  
research  is Nalanda  District  in Bihar,  
India . Here,  as in much  of the region  in 
which TAFSSA’s  studies  are ongoing,   a 
key component  of agricultural  
production  is the use of groundwater  to 
irrigate  crops . The use of groundwater  – 
like other  natural  resources  – should  be 
managed  carefully,  with  an eye towards  
assuring  long -term  sustainability  and avoiding  trade -offs that can compromise  
continued  use of the natural  resource .
Groundwater flow  modeling  plays  a 
crucial  role in comprehending  and 
efficiently  managing  groundwater  
resources . Modeling  can help  in the the 
identification  of : 
•Understanding variations in 
groundwater levels over time, 
including seasonal patterns and 
system shocks.
•Analyzing the influence of subsurface characteristics on groundwater flow behavior.
•Identifying areas with water deficits or abundance within aquifers.
•Tracking the movement of contaminants within aquifers.
•Developing effective strategies for sustainable groundwater management and conservation.
As a response  to thes e issues , 
groundwater  modeling  was conducted 
across  Nalanda District  as an example  
research  learning  location  to assess the 
influence  of climate  change  on 
groundwater  resources  and explore  
viable  cropping  system  diversification  
choices  for smallholder  farmers .August 2023 Research Protocol 8

3LOCATION
Nalanda  District  spans  approximately  
2,300 km2 (Figure  1). The administrative  
and hydrological boundaries  of the 
district were  determined using  
Government  of India survey maps                  
(available  online  and accessible  at 
https ://onlinemaps .surveyofindia .gov.in/
FreeMapSpecification .aspx ).
The climate  in Nalanda falls within  the 
sub-tropical  to sub-humid  category,  
characterized  by an annual  average  
rainfall  of approximately  975 mm.  The 
majority  of this rainfall,  around  90%, is 
received  during  the monsoon  season  
from  June  to September . Nalanda's  
topography  varies  from  35 to 450 
meters  above  mean  sea level . 
Agriculture  is the dominant  land  use in 
the district,  occupying  approximately  
90% of the total  land  area,  with  a 
primary focus  on cereal -based crop  
production .
Nalanda is primarily  composed  of flat 
alluvial terrain,  with  the exception  of Rajgir  Hill (343 m above  mean  sea level)  
in the south,  which is crystalline  rock . 
(CGWB,  2022) . The alluvial area has 
been  explored  to a depth  of 150 m and 
contains  layered  aquifers . The region  is 
characterized  by clay  beds  interspersed  
with  sand . In the north  of the district 
there  are four  alluvial fills with  coarse  
sand  and gravel  a depth  of 100-120 m 
overlaid  with  clay  (Saha,  2007 ).
Across Nalanda there  is a general  
downwards  slope  towards  the 
northeast,  with  the Mohana,  Panchane , 
Falgu  and Sakri  Rivers  flowing  
northeast  into  the River  Ganges  which 
borders  the district.  Groundwater flow  
is also  largely  northeast  following  
topology,  however  there  are local  flows  
in different  directions  based on local  
hydraulic  gradients .
Groundwater is monitored  at 39 
hydrograph  stations  which contribute  
to the National  Hydrograph  Monitoring  
Network . Water  level  data  from  eight  
dug  well  stations  are available  from  
2000  onwards ; these  were  used  in 
calibrating  and validating  the 
groundwater  model . Data  from  another  
31 stations  are available  from 2013  
onwards .

4METHODOLOGY
MODFLOW is a modular  finite -
difference  groundwater  flow  model  
(Winston,  2014 ). It is extensively  used  to 
simulate  groundwater  aquifer  systems. 
It employs  the finite  difference  method  
and is used to quantify  the movement  
and distribution  of groundwater  
components  through  porous  below -
ground  media . MODFLOW can also  be 
used  to predict changes  to 
groundwater  levels  and behavior  over  
time  based  on the anthropogenic  and 
natural  processes.
MODFLOW is underpinned  by a three -
dimensional  groundwater  flow  
equation  (Rushton and Redshaw , 1979 ), 
as well  as a second  order  partial  
differential  equation  which is 
transformed  into  a finite  difference  
equation  using  a Taylor  series  and then  
into  a more  readily  solvable  linear  
equation  (Figure  2). This  enables  
researchers  to estimate  ‘hydraulic  
head,’  i.e. the level  of elevation  and 
depict direction  of flow  of groundwater.
Here  we develop  a groundwater  flow  
model  for Nalanda District in Bihar,  
India,  using  MODFLOW- NWT  and  the 
graphical  interface  Model  Muse  v5.1.1 
(Winston,  2009  & 2014 ).We use MODFLOW to estimate   
groundwater  flows  and analyze  the 
potential  effects  of different  agricultural  
management  scenarios  in a three -step 
process :
1.Conceptualizing  the aquifer  and
defining  its boundaries  to devise  a
good -fit locally -specific  model ;
2.C alibrating  and validating  the
locally -specific  model  using  field
data ;
3.Identifying  and developing  different
scenarios  to examine  groundwater
extraction  and recharge  under
different  agronomic  management
practices  and climates .
Field  data  are used  to define  a 
conceptual  model  of an underground  
aquifer,  including  its area and 
subsurface characteristics . The 
conceptual  model  is then  converted  
into  a numerical  model  using  Darcy’s  
Law  (equation  1) to compute  flows  into  
and out of the aquifer  (Mercer,  & Faust 
1980 ) as follows  in Equation  1:
Q = -KA 𝜕𝜕𝜕
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 (1)
where  Q is the flow  rate,  K is hydraulic  
conductivity  within  the aquifer,  A is the 
cross -sectional  area  of the aquifer,  and
𝜕𝜕𝜕
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 describes  the gradient  and direction  
of water  flow .
To develop  a local groundwater  model  
for Nalanda District,  we incorporate  
Darcy's  Law  into  MODFLOW. This  
includes  defining  boundary  and initial  
conditions  and accounting  for observed  
water  extraction,  like irrigation  
pumping,  to simulate  aquifer  water  
flow . The model  is then  calibrated and 
validated against  real water  level  data  
from the aquifer,  ensuring  its accuracy  
for Nalanda's  specific  conditions .Figure 2: The MODFLOW process for 
generating each hydraulic head
Page 5:
5Conceptualizing the groundwater 
model
The Nalanda District  groundwater  
aquifer  is conceptualized  with  500 m × 
500 m cells  (Figure  3) in three  
dimensions  using  lithology  data  from  
the Indian  Central  Groundwater  Board 
(CGWB,  2022) . Intermittent sand  layers  
at the surface  are unconfined  aquifers,  
while  the deeper  sand  layers  under - 
and over -lain by clay  layers  are confined  
aquifers .
Hydraulic  conductivity  differs  in the 
horizontal  and vertical  plains . The 
general  flow  direction  of groundwater  is 
from  the southwest  to the northeast ; 
administrative  district  boundaries  mean  
that the southwest  and northeast  outer  
boundaries  in the model  have  no flow  
conditions . On the south  boundary  an 
outcrop  of crystalline  rock  associated  
with  Rajgir  Hill also  has no flow  
condition .
Multiple  rivers  and canals  across  the 
district act as river  boundaries ; rivers  also  act as water  sources  and sinks,  
depending  on flow . Information  on river  
flow  patterns  was derived  using  Google  
Earth  images . Riverbed  conductivity  is 
initially  assigned  a generic  value  which 
is subsequently  calibrated using  
observed  data  from  across  Nalanda  
District .
Groundwater  recharge,  abstraction  and 
initial aquifer  parameters  (such  as 
hydraulic  conductivity,  specific  yield  & 
storage  capacity)  are sourced  from  the 
Indian  Central  Groundwater  Board  
(CGWB,  2022) . The spatial  variability  of 
recharge  and pumping  are defined  
based on geology  and land  use  across  
different  seasons .
Lateral  inflows  and outflows  from  
southwest  to northeast  across  the 
District  boundaries  are simulated  using  
time -variable  specified  head  
boundaries . These  boundaries  are then  
calibrated using  the nearest  observed  
hydraulic  head  data .

6Calibrating and validating the 
groundwater model 
Initially,  we conducted  a steady -state  
run of the MODFLOW model  to assess  
topographic  variability . During  this 
phase,  hydraulic  conductivity  was 
calibrated and subsequently  utilized  as 
an input parameter  in the transient  
model .
Subsequently,  a transient  version  of the 
model  was calibrated by incorporating  
groundwater  level  data  observed  
during  the period  from  2000  to 2014 . In 
this calibration  process,  we utilized  a 
total  of 480 distinct data  points  to 
optimize  parameters  such  as 'river  conductance,'  'specific  yield,'  and 
'specific  storage'  specific  to Nalanda  
District . Finally,  for model  validation,  an 
additional  set of 111 data  points  from  the 
years  2014  to 2018  were  employed .
The root  mean  square  error  (RMSE)  for 
model  calibration  and validation  were  
both  less than 5 % (1.6 and 2.0 m, 
respectively),  indicating  the model  
reasonably  closely  replicates  the aquifer  
system  to a level  acceptable  for 
subsequent additional  simulation  
(Figure  4). There  is also a high degree  of 
confidence  in simulated  groundwater  
flows  generated  for Nalanda District  
using  MODFLOW.

7Historical  groundwater  trends  inform  
scenario  development
Between  2000  and 2018  groundwater  in 
Nalanda District  declined  at about 6 cm 
year-1. This  depletion  appears  to be at 
least  partly  a result  of both  natural  
discharge  from  rivers  and  aquifer  
boundaries,  and from anthropogenic  
extraction  through  groundwater  
pumping  for agronomic  irrigation . While  groundwater  levels  are currently  
within  a range  of 1.5 to 6 m below  from  
the surface,  recharge  from  rainfall  and 
river  inflows  appears  to be inadequate  
to fully  recharge  the aquifer . This  
therefore signifies  some  concerns  for 
long -term  sustainability  of this 
important natural  resource . 
Across the District  average  annual  net 
storage  loss was 11.19 MCM  year-1 
between  2000 and 2018  (Figure  5).

Scenario  modelling
MODFLOW was used  to estimate  
groundwater  flow,  extraction  and 
recharge  for current  and alternative  
agronomic  management  practices  for 
climate  scenarios  in Nalanda District  
Plausible  future  climate  information  
for 2018  to 2060  has been  generated  
from  the CMIP 6 global  climate  model  
(Mishra et al., 2020 ). 
In a business- as-usual  scenario,  
considering  current  agronomic  
management  practices  and recharge  
variability  based on the ACCESS -CM2 
climate  model  (SSP 585),  there  is a 
projected reduction  in groundwater  
levels  of approximately  3 meters  from  
2018  to 2060 , as illustrated  in Figure  6. 
This  decline  poses  a significant  threat  
to the aquifer's  sustainability  and will 
negatively  impact  farmers'  capacity  to 
access  irrigation  water,  particularly  
during  the dry season . In response,  TAFSSA  researchers  are 
collaboratively  developing  a range  
of agronomic  management  
scenarios  for additional  modeling  in 
partnership  with  key stakeholders  in 
agriculture  and water  management . 
These  scenarios  are being  carefully  
designed  to be both  practical  and 
appealing  to decision -makers  in 
both  the public  and private  sectors .
These  scenarios  will facilitate  the 
comparison  of future  alternative  
crop  management  practices,  aiming  
to reduce  irrigation  water  usage,  
enhance  water -use efficiency,  
recharge  the aquifer,  and/or  
diversify  crops  within  cropping  
systems.  These  innovative  cropping  
systems will also  seek  to increase  
the nutritional  and economic  value  
of smallholder  production  systems  
without  imposing  significant  labor  
requirements  or production  costs .

Sustainable development 
and management of a 
crucial natural resource 
A research protocol to model 
groundwater flow in Nalanda District, Bihar, India
BACKGROUND/CONTEXT
Across South  Asia,  millions  of small -scale  
farmers  are confronted  with  a range  of 
urgent  challenges . These  include  
poverty,  malnutrition,  environmental  
deterioration,  and the growing  impacts  
of climate  change  and unpredictability  
(Ericksen et al., 2011). Despite  these  
pressin g concerns,  the region’s  farming  
systems still have  potential  to 
sustainably  its productivity  and 
profitability  (Islam  et al., 2019 ; Gathala  et 
al., 2021 ). The Transforming  Agrifood  
Systems  in South  Asia  (TAFSSA) research  
integrates  interdisciplinary  studies  at 
both  the farm  and landscape  levels  to 
discover  approaches  that  enable  farmers  
to enhance  their  income  and nutritional  
output while  also  preserving  natural  
resources .
One  of the key high- priority  learning  
locations  in which TAFSSA  conducts  
research  is Nalanda  District  in Bihar,  
India . Here,  as in much  of the region  in 
which TAFSSA’s  studies  are ongoing,   a 
key component  of agricultural  
production  is the use of groundwater  to 
irrigate  crops . The use of groundwater  – 
like other  natural  resources  – should  be 
managed  carefully,  with  an eye towards  
assuring  long -term  sustainability  and avoiding  trade -offs that can compromise  
continued  use of the natural  resource .
Groundwater flow  modeling  plays  a 
crucial  role in comprehending  and 
efficiently  managing  groundwater  
resources . Modeling  can help  in the the 
identification  of : 
•Understanding variations in 
groundwater levels over time, 
including seasonal patterns and 
system shocks.
•Analyzing the influence of subsurface characteristics on groundwater flow behavior.
•Identifying areas with water deficits or abundance within aquifers.
•Tracking the movement of contaminants within aquifers.
•Developing effective strategies for sustainable groundwater management and conservation.
As a response  to thes e issues , 
groundwater  modeling  was conducted 
across  Nalanda District  as an example  
research  learning  location  to assess the 
influence  of climate  change  on 
groundwater  resources  and explore  
viable  cropping  system  diversification  
choices  for smallholder  farmers .August 2023 Research Protocol 8

3LOCATION
Nalanda  District  spans  approximately  
2,300 km2 (Figure  1). The administrative  
and hydrological boundaries  of the 
district were  determined using  
Government  of India survey maps                  
(available  online  and accessible  at 
https ://onlinemaps .surveyofindia .gov.in/
FreeMapSpecification .aspx ).
The climate  in Nalanda falls within  the 
sub-tropical  to sub-humid  category,  
characterized  by an annual  average  
rainfall  of approximately  975 mm.  The 
majority  of this rainfall,  around  90%, is 
received  during  the monsoon  season  
from  June  to September . Nalanda's  
topography  varies  from  35 to 450 
meters  above  mean  sea level . 
Agriculture  is the dominant  land  use in 
the district,  occupying  approximately  
90% of the total  land  area,  with  a 
primary focus  on cereal -based crop  
production .
Nalanda is primarily  composed  of flat 
alluvial terrain,  with  the exception  of Rajgir  Hill (343 m above  mean  sea level)  
in the south,  which is crystalline  rock . 
(CGWB,  2022) . The alluvial area has 
been  explored  to a depth  of 150 m and 
contains  layered  aquifers . The region  is 
characterized  by clay  beds  interspersed  
with  sand . In the north  of the district 
there  are four  alluvial fills with  coarse  
sand  and gravel  a depth  of 100-120 m 
overlaid  with  clay  (Saha,  2007 ).
Across Nalanda there  is a general  
downwards  slope  towards  the 
northeast,  with  the Mohana,  Panchane , 
Falgu  and Sakri  Rivers  flowing  
northeast  into  the River  Ganges  which 
borders  the district.  Groundwater flow  
is also  largely  northeast  following  
topology,  however  there  are local  flows  
in different  directions  based on local  
hydraulic  gradients .
Groundwater is monitored  at 39 
hydrograph  stations  which contribute  
to the National  Hydrograph  Monitoring  
Network . Water  level  data  from  eight  
dug  well  stations  are available  from  
2000  onwards ; these  were  used  in 
calibrating  and validating  the 
groundwater  model . Data  from  another  
31 stations  are available  from 2013  
onwards .

4METHODOLOGY
MODFLOW is a modular  finite -
difference  groundwater  flow  model  
(Winston,  2014 ). It is extensively  used  to 
simulate  groundwater  aquifer  systems. 
It employs  the finite  difference  method  
and is used to quantify  the movement  
and distribution  of groundwater  
components  through  porous  below -
ground  media . MODFLOW can also  be 
used  to predict changes  to 
groundwater  levels  and behavior  over  
time  based  on the anthropogenic  and 
natural  processes.
MODFLOW is underpinned  by a three -
dimensional  groundwater  flow  
equation  (Rushton and Redshaw , 1979 ), 
as well  as a second  order  partial  
differential  equation  which is 
transformed  into  a finite  difference  
equation  using  a Taylor  series  and then  
into  a more  readily  solvable  linear  
equation  (Figure  2). This  enables  
researchers  to estimate  ‘hydraulic  
head,’  i.e. the level  of elevation  and 
depict direction  of flow  of groundwater.
Here  we develop  a groundwater  flow  
model  for Nalanda District in Bihar,  
India,  using  MODFLOW- NWT  and  the 
graphical  interface  Model  Muse  v5.1.1 
(Winston,  2009  & 2014 ).We use MODFLOW to estimate   
groundwater  flows  and analyze  the 
potential  effects  of different  agricultural  
management  scenarios  in a three -step 
process :
1.Conceptualizing  the aquifer  and
defining  its boundaries  to devise  a
good -fit locally -specific  model ;
2.C alibrating  and validating  the
locally -specific  model  using  field
data ;
3.Identifying  and developing  different
scenarios  to examine  groundwater
extraction  and recharge  under
different  agronomic  management
practices  and climates .
Field  data  are used  to define  a 
conceptual  model  of an underground  
aquifer,  including  its area and 
subsurface characteristics . The 
conceptual  model  is then  converted  
into  a numerical  model  using  Darcy’s  
Law  (equation  1) to compute  flows  into  
and out of the aquifer  (Mercer,  & Faust 
1980 ) as follows  in Equation  1:
Q = -KA 𝜕𝜕𝜕
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 (1)
where  Q is the flow  rate,  K is hydraulic  
conductivity  within  the aquifer,  A is the 
cross -sectional  area  of the aquifer,  and
𝜕𝜕𝜕
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 describes  the gradient  and direction  
of water  flow .
To develop  a local groundwater  model  
for Nalanda District,  we incorporate  
Darcy's  Law  into  MODFLOW. This  
includes  defining  boundary  and initial  
conditions  and accounting  for observed  
water  extraction,  like irrigation  
pumping,  to simulate  aquifer  water  
flow . The model  is then  calibrated and 
validated against  real water  level  data  
from the aquifer,  ensuring  its accuracy  
for Nalanda's  specific  conditions .Figure 2: The MODFLOW process for 
generating each hydraulic head
Page 5:
5Conceptualizing the groundwater 
model
The Nalanda District  groundwater  
aquifer  is conceptualized  with  500 m × 
500 m cells  (Figure  3) in three  
dimensions  using  lithology  data  from  
the Indian  Central  Groundwater  Board 
(CGWB,  2022) . Intermittent sand  layers  
at the surface  are unconfined  aquifers,  
while  the deeper  sand  layers  under - 
and over -lain by clay  layers  are confined  
aquifers .
Hydraulic  conductivity  differs  in the 
horizontal  and vertical  plains . The 
general  flow  direction  of groundwater  is 
from  the southwest  to the northeast ; 
administrative  district  boundaries  mean  
that the southwest  and northeast  outer  
boundaries  in the model  have  no flow  
conditions . On the south  boundary  an 
outcrop  of crystalline  rock  associated  
with  Rajgir  Hill also  has no flow  
condition .
Multiple  rivers  and canals  across  the 
district act as river  boundaries ; rivers  also  act as water  sources  and sinks,  
depending  on flow . Information  on river  
flow  patterns  was derived  using  Google  
Earth  images . Riverbed  conductivity  is 
initially  assigned  a generic  value  which 
is subsequently  calibrated using  
observed  data  from  across  Nalanda  
District .
Groundwater  recharge,  abstraction  and 
initial aquifer  parameters  (such  as 
hydraulic  conductivity,  specific  yield  & 
storage  capacity)  are sourced  from  the 
Indian  Central  Groundwater  Board  
(CGWB,  2022) . The spatial  variability  of 
recharge  and pumping  are defined  
based on geology  and land  use  across  
different  seasons .
Lateral  inflows  and outflows  from  
southwest  to northeast  across  the 
District  boundaries  are simulated  using  
time -variable  specified  head  
boundaries . These  boundaries  are then  
calibrated using  the nearest  observed  
hydraulic  head  data .
Figure 3: Three- dimensional conceptualization of aquifer geometry in Nalanda District.

6Calibrating and validating the 
groundwater model 
Initially,  we conducted  a steady -state  
run of the MODFLOW model  to assess  
topographic  variability . During  this 
phase,  hydraulic  conductivity  was 
calibrated and subsequently  utilized  as 
an input parameter  in the transient  
model .
Subsequently,  a transient  version  of the 
model  was calibrated by incorporating  
groundwater  level  data  observed  
during  the period  from  2000  to 2014 . In 
this calibration  process,  we utilized  a 
total  of 480 distinct data  points  to 
optimize  parameters  such  as 'river  conductance,'  'specific  yield,'  and 
'specific  storage'  specific  to Nalanda  
District . Finally,  for model  validation,  an 
additional  set of 111 data  points  from  the 
years  2014  to 2018  were  employed .
The root  mean  square  error  (RMSE)  for 
model  calibration  and validation  were  
both  less than 5 % (1.6 and 2.0 m, 
respectively),  indicating  the model  
reasonably  closely  replicates  the aquifer  
system  to a level  acceptable  for 
subsequent additional  simulation  
(Figure  4). There  is also a high degree  of 
confidence  in simulated  groundwater  
flows  generated  for Nalanda District  
using  MODFLOW.

7Historical  groundwater  trends  inform  
scenario  development
Between  2000  and 2018  groundwater  in 
Nalanda District  declined  at about 6 cm 
year-1. This  depletion  appears  to be at 
least  partly  a result  of both  natural  
discharge  from  rivers  and  aquifer  
boundaries,  and from anthropogenic  
extraction  through  groundwater  
pumping  for agronomic  irrigation . While  groundwater  levels  are currently  
within  a range  of 1.5 to 6 m below  from  
the surface,  recharge  from  rainfall  and 
river  inflows  appears  to be inadequate  
to fully  recharge  the aquifer . This  
therefore signifies  some  concerns  for 
long -term  sustainability  of this 
important natural  resource . 
Across the District  average  annual  net 
storage  loss was 11.19 MCM  year-1 
between  2000 and 2018  (Figure  5).

Scenario  modelling
MODFLOW was used  to estimate  
groundwater  flow,  extraction  and 
recharge  for current  and alternative  
agronomic  management  practices  for 
climate  scenarios  in Nalanda District  
Plausible  future  climate  information  
for 2018  to 2060  has been  generated  
from  the CMIP 6 global  climate  model  
(Mishra et al., 2020 ). 
In a business- as-usual  scenario,  
considering  current  agronomic  
management  practices  and recharge  
variability  based on the ACCESS -CM2 
climate  model  (SSP 585),  there  is a 
projected reduction  in groundwater  
levels  of approximately  3 meters  from  
2018  to 2060 , as illustrated  in Figure  6. 
This  decline  poses  a significant  threat  
to the aquifer's  sustainability  and will 
negatively  impact  farmers'  capacity  to 
access  irrigation  water,  particularly  
during  the dry season . In response,  TAFSSA  researchers  are 
collaboratively  developing  a range  
of agronomic  management  
scenarios  for additional  modeling  in 
partnership  with  key stakeholders  in 
agriculture  and water  management . 
These  scenarios  are being  carefully  
designed  to be both  practical  and 
appealing  to decision -makers  in 
both  the public  and private  sectors .
These  scenarios  will facilitate  the 
comparison  of future  alternative  
crop  management  practices,  aiming  
to reduce  irrigation  water  usage,  
enhance  water -use efficiency,  
recharge  the aquifer,  and/or  
diversify  crops  within  cropping  
systems.  These  innovative  cropping  
systems will also  seek  to increase  
the nutritional  and economic  value  
of smallholder  production  systems  
without  imposing  significant  labor  
requirements  or production  costs .

"10236","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

CGIAR IPSR Innovation Profile | Sustainable rangeland management toolkit for resilient pastoral systems
Sustainable rangeland management toolkit for 
resilient pastoral systems
Sustainable rangeland management toolkit with a holistic and multidisciplinary approach 
for addressing the biophysical and sociocultural aspects under changing climate and land 
use leading towards more resilient pastoral systems.
The sustainable rangeland management (SRM) toolkit advocates for a holistic and participatory multi-stakeholder 
approach that emphasizes the important role played by governance of rangelands using bottom-up landscape 
restoration. It emphasizes the need to ensure that decisions are based on both indigenous knowledge and modern 
science to address site-specific challenges. The goal of the toolkit is to assist and prepare practitioners working closely 
with local communities perform proper diagnostic, plan, and implement specific interventions and continuously 
monitor and evaluate rehabilitation or restoration efforts. Users have access to a collection of validated SRM practices 
aimed at achieving a neutral level of degradation (LDN) and offering a strong potential to rehabilitate and restore 
degraded rangeland ecosystems. The case studies demonstrate step by step how the toolkit is used to identify 
practical solutions that are integrated and socially accepted leading towards more resilient livestock and pastoral 
systems.

CGIAR IPSR Innovation Profile | Sustainable rangeland management toolkit for resilient pastoral systems
Sustainable rangeland management toolkit for 
resilient pastoral systems
Sustainable rangeland management toolkit with a holistic and multidisciplinary approach 
for addressing the biophysical and sociocultural aspects under changing climate and land 
use leading towards more resilient pastoral systems.
The sustainable rangeland management (SRM) toolkit advocates for a holistic and participatory multi-stakeholder 
approach that emphasizes the important role played by governance of rangelands using bottom-up landscape 
restoration. It emphasizes the need to ensure that decisions are based on both indigenous knowledge and modern 
science to address site-specific challenges. The goal of the toolkit is to assist and prepare practitioners working closely 
with local communities perform proper diagnostic, plan, and implement specific interventions and continuously 
monitor and evaluate rehabilitation or restoration efforts. Users have access to a collection of validated SRM practices 
aimed at achieving a neutral level of degradation (LDN) and offering a strong potential to rehabilitate and restore 
degraded rangeland ecosystems. The case studies demonstrate step by step how the toolkit is used to identify 
practical solutions that are integrated and socially accepted leading towards more resilient livestock and pastoral 
systems.

Context
Our innovative approach
•Farmers in Tunisia are embracing feed pellet 
production , made accessible through farmer 
organizations that have adopted the feed 
business innovation. 
•A range of feed pellet formulas has been 
developed in collaboration with Tunisian NARES, 
considering regional variations and availability 
of by -products ( eg. in the south, oasis farmers 
utilize downgraded dates and kernels; in central 
Tunisia, olive cakes are produced).•Over 500 imported pelletizing machines of different 
sizes (capacity between 150 kg/ and 2,000 kg/h) are 
used by individual farmers and cooperatives after 
decentralized introduction of the technology by NARS 
and ICARDA.
•One farmer cooperative has developed its own feed 
pellet label called “ Youfeed ” and sells about 7 tons of 
Youfeed  per month to its members.
•One local machine manufacturer has produced a 
Tunisian prototype of a pelletizing machine .Transforming locally available

Context
Our innovative approach
•Farmers in Tunisia are embracing feed pellet 
production , made accessible through farmer 
organizations that have adopted the feed 
business innovation. 
•A range of feed pellet formulas has been 
developed in collaboration with Tunisian NARES, 
considering regional variations and availability 
of by -products ( eg. in the south, oasis farmers 
utilize downgraded dates and kernels; in central 
Tunisia, olive cakes are produced).•Over 500 imported pelletizing machines of different 
sizes (capacity between 150 kg/ and 2,000 kg/h) are 
used by individual farmers and cooperatives after 
decentralized introduction of the technology by NARS 
and ICARDA.
•One farmer cooperative has developed its own feed 
pellet label called “ Youfeed ” and sells about 7 tons of 
Youfeed  per month to its members.
•One local machine manufacturer has produced a 
Tunisian prototype of a pelletizing machine .Transforming locally available 
feed ingredients into 
affordable and nutritious 
livestock feed pellets

Next steps
SAPLING
•Ethiopia : Foster development of feed businesses 
managed by farmer cooperatives by introducing feed 
production chains. Three feed units already 
distributed, with ongoing training sessions on feed 
composition and market linkages.
•Mali : Identify and explore small -scale mechanization 
possibilities for feed production, aimed at enhancing 
efficiency and productivity.
LIVESTOCK & CLIMATE
•Tunisia : Establish a pastural living lab in southern 
Tunisia, dedicated to the development of livestock -
related initiatives. Introduce feed production 
machinery such as pelletizers, grinders, and feed 
mixers to facilitate growth of the feed businesses.","2379"

In other words, barriers to progress are typically viewed as issues of technology adoption, not as part of the innovation process itself. This study contributes to changing the paradigm by proposing a living lab approach, which considers innovation as an adaptive process where stakeholders co-produce knowledge and collaborate based on inclusivity and empowerment. Our specific concept for this approach is called a Living Lab for People (LL4P). This conceptual paper outlines a framework to guide the development of a LL4P that remains flexible to be adapted for specific sites. While we seek to identify common denominators, we recognize the necessity for such a framework to remain open enough to be adaptable for varied contexts. Consequently, the framework draws on the living lab literature but tailors existing approaches for sustainable food system transformation and puts people (men, women, and marginalized groups among key food system actors) at the center of innovation processes with a clear intention to address power and social inequity. We draw on specific cases in China, Colombia, Kenya and Vietnam as learning grounds for formulating LL4Ps through locally led innovation processes. Based on our learnings and consultations, we define a LL4P as an inclusive and diverse space for people to advance their socio-technical innovation processes and associated modes of governance within a facilitated organizational structure. The principles of LL4Ps include co-production, gender equality and social inclusion, governance and institutional sustainability to advance existing and novel innovation processes. The practical experiences from applying this framework in the four case studies indicate alternative pathways for transforming the food system toward a sustainable and socially equitable trajectory through the establishment of a LL4P.

In other words, barriers to progress are typically viewed as issues of technology adoption, not as part of the innovation process itself. This study contributes to changing the paradigm by proposing a living lab approach, which considers innovation as an adaptive process where stakeholders co-produce knowledge and collaborate based on inclusivity and empowerment. Our specific concept for this approach is called a Living Lab for People (LL4P). This conceptual paper outlines a framework to guide the development of a LL4P that remains flexible to be adapted for specific sites. While we seek to identify common denominators, we recognize the necessity for such a framework to remain open enough to be adaptable for varied contexts. Consequently, the framework draws on the living lab literature but tailors existing approaches for sustainable food system transformation and puts people (men, women, and marginalized groups among key food system actors) at the center of innovation processes with a clear intention to address power and social inequity. We draw on specific cases in China, Colombia, Kenya and Vietnam as learning grounds for formulating LL4Ps through locally led innovation processes. Based on our learnings and consultations, we define a LL4P as an inclusive and diverse space for people to advance their socio-technical innovation processes and associated modes of governance within a facilitated organizational structure. The principles of LL4Ps include co-production, gender equality and social inclusion, governance and institutional sustainability to advance existing and novel innovation processes. The practical experiences from applying this framework in the four case studies indicate alternative pathways for transforming the food system toward a sustainable and socially equitable trajectory through the establishment of a LL4P.

• Yemen is experiencing one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises resulting from prolonged conflict, with about half the population suffering from food insecurity.
• Food availability and affordability in Yemen is extremely vulnerable to external shocks because of the fragility of the national food system and its heavy dependence on food imports by the private sector and international humanitarian agencies.
• A recent workshop jointly organized by IFPRI and HSA Group reviewed the state of collaboration between key actors in Yemen’s food system and discussed avenues to building strong cross-sector partnerships for ending the current food crisis and strengthening food system resilience.
• Limited collaboration among the public, private, and third sectors (for example, in the form of collective action, multistakeholder partnerships) contributes to inefficiencies in food supply chains and food aid delivery.
• Currently, collaborations are often ad hoc, limited to peer-to-peer partnerships, and constrained by a siloed mentality.
• With a potential peace agreement, new opportunities for cross sector collaboration and strategic partnerships between food system actors are emerging.
• Enhanced communication among the public, private, and third sectors is an important first step toward improving mutual understanding, building trust, exchanging critical information and ideas, and realizing opportunities for effective collective action.

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o","Environment","'They think we are delaying their outputs' - The challenges of interdisciplinary research: understanding power dynamics between social and biophysical scientists in international crop breeding teams Public sector crop improvement for development programmes aims to produce varieties tailored to the needs of smallholder farmers and their environments. Understanding how social heterogeneity, including gender, drives trait preferences is essential to ensure that crop improvement objectives meet farmers’ and stakeholder demands. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating social science knowledge with crop breeding. Although the necessity of interdisciplinary research is recognised and promoted, it is impeded by a multitude of challenges including ontological and epistemological differences, institutional and global hierarchies, disciplinary power relations and struggles for scientific authority. The Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D) sector is marked by entrenched power differentials, including dominance of the biophysical sciences, a historical emphasis on technical solutions which ignores social contexts, and the underrepresentation of women scientists and farmers themselves. Nevertheless, there is limited theoretically informed analysis of power dynamics within AR4D settings. Drawing on qualitative, ethnographic observations of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement (ILCI), this article seeks to understand how power affects interdisciplinary research processes. Critical ethnography and power theory is used to analyse power within international crop breeding collaborations and the implications for inclusive knowledge production and research impact. The Powercube is used to examine how visible, hidden and invisible forms of power manifest within local, national, and international relationships across closed, invited and claimed spaces. Our findings suggest that these intersecting power dimensions, which include disciplinary, gendered, institutional and global hierarchies, constrain the contributions that individual researchers can make – particularly social scientists – thereby hindering disciplinary integration. The ILCI case study reveals the complex multi-dimensional dynamics that emerge within agricultural research teams and highlights structural limitations constraining efforts to build socially inclusive and gender-responsive crop improvement programmes. The article contributes to a small but growing literature studying the social construction of agricultural science, and provides insights that can enable interdisciplinary research strategies to more effectively meet the needs of farmers and other stakeholders.

Resumen  
Este informe presenta los resultados obtenidos durante el primer año de la aplicación del enfoque de Diseño 
Centrado en el Humano (DCH) —con su componente intrínseco de perspectiva de género — en relación con la 
generación de servicios agroclimáticos en Honduras . En él, se describe el proceso de investigación de usuario que 
alimentó las primeras dos fases del ciclo de diseño —i.e., alcance  y explorar — y los insumos que obtenidos de 
agricultores/as y técnicos/as de l departamento de El  Paraíso  e instituciones como InfoAgro y la Dirección de Ciencia 
y Tecnología Agropecuaria (DICTA) de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería (SAG) de H onduras . A la fecha, l a 
información generada permitió crear  una tipología  de usuario, o persona  —como se conoce en el  marco del  DCH — 
para agricultores. Los siguientes pasos serán  la generación de personas  para técnicos /as y tomadores /as de 
decisiones , así como  los primeros prototipos  de boletines  (para agricultores /as y técnicos /as) y reportes 
agroclimáticos (para tomadores /as de decisiones) . Estos serán refinados a partir de un ejercicio piloto a  
implementarse  durante el primer semestre de 2024 . 
 
Abstract  
This report presents the results of the first year of applying the Human Centered Design (HCD) approach —with its 
inherent gender perspective —to the generation of agro -climatic services generation in Honduras . It describes the 
user research process that fed the first two phases of the design cycle —scope and explore —and the input received 
from farmers and technicians in the department of El Paraíso and institutions such as InfoAgro and the Dirección de 
Ciencia y Tecnología Agropecuaria  (DICTA) of the Honduran  Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería  (SAG). So far, the 
information generated has made it possible to create a  user typology , or persona , for farmers. The next steps will be 
the generation of personas  for technicians and decision -makers, as well as the first prototypes of agroclimatic 
bulletins (for farmers and technicians) and reports (for decision -makers). These will be refined through a pilot 
exercise to be implemented in the first half of 2024.

 Introducción  
Adopción e inclusión. ¿ Cómo alcanzarlas cuando se trata de herramientas y soluciones para los actores del sistema 
agroalimentario centroamericano? El enfoque —o metodología como también se conoce — de Diseño Centrado en 
el Humano (DCH) ha demostrado ser eficaz no solo en áreas rel acionadas con la generación y consumo de 
productos digitales, sino también para generar soluciones que mejoran las condiciones de vida de las personas 
más vulnerables de la sociedad. IDEO.org , por ejemplo, ha sido demostrado tener impacto positivo mediante la 
aplicación del enfoque DCH para producir soluciones que impactan la vida de personas en diferentes lugares del 
planeta.  
En ese sentido, La Alianza Bioversity -CIAT ha decidido adoptar el enfoque de DCH para garantizar que el desarrollo 
de nuevas herramientas —y la revisión y ajuste de las existentes — sea guiado por principios más cercanos a las 
necesidades y condiciones habi litantes de las personas para las que se hace investigación. De ahí que se haya 
defini do este enfoque como un proceso de cinco fases, que se basan en la i) identificación de un problema o desafío 
de diseño ( scope  o alcance), ii) la colección de información  de los usuarios ( explore  o exploración), iii) el diseño de 
prototipos ( create  o creación), iv) la evaluación de los prototipos en pilotos con usuarios y grupos de interés ( validate  
o validación) y, finalmente, v) la reanudación el ciclo de diseño a partir de una evaluación constante que tienen lugar 
durante la fase de escalamiento de la herramienta ( scale  o escalamiento) ( Figura 1). Como se puede observar, en 
cada una de las fases hay momentos divergencia (generación de ideas de manera profusa) y convergencia 
(concreción de esas ideas en temas y oportunidades de diseño) ( Figura 1). Esta dinámica es propia del ciclo de 
diseño, el cual es iterativo y siempre susceptible a mejorar.

Los resultados obtenidos hasta el momento son alentadores, en parte, por la unidad de visión que comparten 
nuestros socios con la Alianza , pues se reconoc e que el DCH ha permitido  —y permitirá a futuro — identificar con 
mayor claridad las necesidades de los usuarios.  
A continuación, se presenta el reporte  compuesto por tres secciones que describen cada una de las fases del ciclo 
de diseño  abarcadas a  la fecha (i.e., alcance  y exploración) ( Figura 1), y otra sección dedicada a las  reflexiones  
finales .

 Fases de alcance y exploración  
Fase 1: Alcance  
A partir de las consultas  sostenidas en mayo de 2023 con el equipo de la Alianza en Honduras y 
algunos de sus socios como InfoAgro , de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería (SAG) , y el Centro 
de Estudios Atmosféricos, Oceanográficos y S ísmicos (CENAOS)  de la Secretaría de Gestión de 
Riesgo y Contingencias Nacionales  s se identificó el desafío de diseño —o problemática a afrontar —
: Producir boletines y reportes agroclimáticos mejor adaptados a las necesidades de  
diferentes tipos de usuarios, e.g.,  agricultores/as, técnicos/as y tomadores de decisiones  de 
los socios de la  Alianza .  
 
Como parte de las actividades de la fase “Alcance”, en mayo también se realizó el taller denominado 
«Diseño centrado en el humano y perspectiva de género» cuyo objetivo fue sensibilizar a los profesionales de la 
Alianza que participan en proyectos de AgriLAC en Honduras , con el enfoque y su relación con la perspectiva de 
Género e Inclusión Social  (GIS) ; dos abordajes estrechamente relacionados. Los objetivos de esta actividad eran i) 
ayudar a entender el marco conceptual del enfoque de DCH —y relación intrínseca con GIS — para visualizar su 
potencial en el aumento de la adopción e inclusión de las herram ientas desarrolladas y, con base en esto, ii) alentar 
la aplicación del enfoque en los diferentes proyectos que se están desarrollando en el marco de AgriLAC.  En el 
taller s e presentaron elementos conceptuales sobre DCH y GIS , y se realizaron ejercicios sobre cómo identificar un 
desafío de diseño, transformar desafíos en oportunidades  y analizar el uso de herramientas a partir de un mapa de 
experiencia.

Se contó con la participación  de 11 personas provenientes de Honduras, México y Colombia , y co n distintas 
formaciones académicas: agronomía, antropología, biología y estadística  (Figura 2). En las reflexiones  finales  del 
taller se mencionó que,  para desarrollar herramientas con  mayor adopción e inclusión , es necesario entender que 
la perspectiva de GIS va más allá de un número  específico de  mujeres y hombre s participando en talleres; más bien, 
se trata de la posibilidad de ser  lo suficientemente  incluyentes para entender mejor las diferentes perspectivas que 
tienen mujeres y hombres sobre la activid ad agropecuaria y las dinámicas del clima de los lugares donde viven y 
desarrollan sus actividades económicas . También se resaltó que , dada la experiencia  que se está generando en la

 Alianza alrede dor del enfoque de DCH , la institución  se encuentra en una posición única para orientar a donantes, 
otros centros de investigación  y socios  sobre las posibilidades que abre el DCH para aumentar l a adopción de los 
servicios climáticos existentes y lo s que se producirán en el futuro . 
El taller dio un impulso importante a los profesionales de la Alianza  en Honduras  para que adoptaran el enfoque  
DCH y lo implementaran en dos acciones específic as; i) la generación de un boletín agroclimático para agricultores 
y ii) un reporte agroclimático para técnicos y tomadores/as de decisiones de I NFOAGRO  y CENAOS. Esto se logró 
hacer de manera sistemática  gracias al desarrollo de un documento denominado plan de investigación de 
usuario ; hoja de ruta para hacer frente al desafío de diseño . En él se consignaron objetivos  y fases de investigación  
(Tabla 1).

(21 – 26 agosto)  Entrevistas a profundidad  Entrevistas semiestructuradas a 
agricultores/as , técnicos /as y 
profesionales, y tomadores /as de

boletines climáticos generados 
por CENAOS , INFOAGRO  y las MTA

Los objetivos de la investigación de usuario  fueron: i) conocer las percepciones de agricultores/as, técnicos/as y 
tomadores /as de decisiones frente a los boletines climáticos y agroclimáticos producidos por CENAOS, I NFOAGRO  
y las Mesas Técnicas Agroclimáticas (MTA); ii) generar tipologías de usuarios que acceden a la información 
agroclimática (creación de personas ); y iii) definir los canales de difusión de información agroclimática más 
adecuada según tipología de usuario.  A la fecha , se ha avanzado  en los dos primeros objetivo s. 
Fase 2: Explorar  
Para entender mejor a las personas con las que se co -diseña, es necesario conocer su contexto , y 
entrevistarlos para entender  sus necesidades, objetivos, capacidades, etc . Se realizaron 15 
entrevistas ; cinco a agricultores; cinco a técnicos y cinco a tomadores  de decisiones  (Figura 3). En 
el Anexo  1 se pueden consultar el instrumento (entrevista) aplicado . Adicionalmente, l a Figura 4 
describe  las actividades desarrolladas en fase “Explorar” ; i) actividades  exploración  para definir el 
desafío de diseño , ii) investigación de usuario (trabajo de campo), iii) sistematización de entrevistas , 
y iv) creación de personas. Todos ellas, insumos necesario s para crear las tipologías de usuario, o 
personas , en el departamento de El Paraíso. De momento,  la primera persona  generada es un 
agricultor del valle de Jamastrán  (Figura 5) al que  le dimos el nombre “Augusto” .  
 
Con el concepto personas  se hace referencia a un perfil de usuario idealizado que representa los deseos y 
necesidades de un subgrupo de una población objetivo . En ese sentido, l as personas  son el resultado de un análisis 
en profundidad de los actuales o futuros usuarios potenciales de su servicio  o herramienta, en este caso, de un 
boletín agroclimático . Además, r epresentan  objetivos, actitudes y patrones de comportamiento más que 
identificadores demográficos como la edad  o el género —que pueden formar parte de  la persona , pero no  son 
considerados como factores diferenciadores para crearl as—.

En ese sentido, “Augusto” será uno de los referentes a tener en cuenta para el desarrollo de boletines agroclimáticos 
y otros servicios climáticos que atiendan a las necesidades de los agricultores en  el departamento de El Paraíso . En 
términos técnicos, la imagen de Augusto fue generad a por la una herramienta de inteligencia artificial conocida 
como Midjourney , mientras que las descripciones de la biografía, objetivos, obstáculos, necesidades , capacidades, 
condiciones habilitantes y canales de información fueron obtenid as de la matriz de Excel con la sistematización de 
las entrevistas a agricultores realizadas durante la investigación  de usuario.  •Conversaciones iniciales con equipo de la Alianza 
y Socios (e.g., Infoagro, CENAOS) Exploración

 Reflexiones finales  
El enfoque de DCH es una apuesta interesante para llevar a cabo investigación interdisciplinaria entre modeladores 
de clima, agrónomos, científicos sociales (e.  g., geógrafos, antropólogos, etc.), diseñadores industriales, ingenieros 
de sistemas y, por supuesto, agricultoras, agricultores, técnicas , técnicos  y socios . La experiencia generada hasta el 
momento indica que existe un gran interés en mejorar la forma en que se genera, comparte e interpreta la 
información agroclimática.  En este sentido, v ale la pena resaltar la importancia de avanzar paralelamente  en dos 
dimensiones; i) el diseño de herramientas intuitivas y de amplia d ifusión —camino en el que se está  avanzando de 
manera rápida — y ii) la generación de información agroclimática localizada y cada vez más precisa —entendiendo 
las dificultades que implica la generación de pronósticos climáticos —.  
Tras esta primera experiencia, que se basa principalmente en el desarrollo de las dos primeras fases del enfoque 
DCH (i.e., alcance  y exploración) (Figura 1), durante el 2024 se espera  continuar con la generación de personas  para 
técnicos/cas y tomadores/as de decisiones  y, posteriormente , con la preparación de prototipos  de boletines  y 
reportes agroclimáticos . Cuando se definan las versiones finales de los boletines y reportes, se harán pilotajes  para  
evaluar el nivel de adopción en los grupos poblacionales  que lo s implementen. En 2024 también se espera reportar 
los hallazgos de este proceso .

Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

Resumen  
Este informe presenta los resultados obtenidos durante el primer año de la aplicación del enfoque de Diseño 
Centrado en el Humano (DCH) —con su componente intrínseco de perspectiva de género — en relación con la 
generación de servicios agroclimáticos en Honduras . En él, se describe el proceso de investigación de usuario que 
alimentó las primeras dos fases del ciclo de diseño —i.e., alcance  y explorar — y los insumos que obtenidos de 
agricultores/as y técnicos/as de l departamento de El  Paraíso  e instituciones como InfoAgro y la Dirección de Ciencia 
y Tecnología Agropecuaria (DICTA) de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería (SAG) de H onduras . A la fecha, l a 
información generada permitió crear  una tipología  de usuario, o persona  —como se conoce en el  marco del  DCH — 
para agricultores. Los siguientes pasos serán  la generación de personas  para técnicos /as y tomadores /as de 
decisiones , así como  los primeros prototipos  de boletines  (para agricultores /as y técnicos /as) y reportes 
agroclimáticos (para tomadores /as de decisiones) . Estos serán refinados a partir de un ejercicio piloto a  
implementarse  durante el primer semestre de 2024 . 
 
Abstract  
This report presents the results of the first year of applying the Human Centered Design (HCD) approach —with its 
inherent gender perspective —to the generation of agro -climatic services generation in Honduras . It describes the 
user research process that fed the first two phases of the design cycle —scope and explore —and the input received 
from farmers and technicians in the department of El Paraíso and institutions such as InfoAgro and the Dirección de 
Ciencia y Tecnología Agropecuaria  (DICTA) of the Honduran  Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería  (SAG). So far, the 
information generated has made it possible to create a  user typology , or persona , for farmers. The next steps will be 
the generation of personas  for technicians and decision -makers, as well as the first prototypes of agroclimatic 
bulletins (for farmers and technicians) and reports (for decision -makers). These will be refined through a pilot 
exercise to be implemented in the first half of 2024.

 Introducción  
Adopción e inclusión. ¿ Cómo alcanzarlas cuando se trata de herramientas y soluciones para los actores del sistema 
agroalimentario centroamericano? El enfoque —o metodología como también se conoce — de Diseño Centrado en 
el Humano (DCH) ha demostrado ser eficaz no solo en áreas rel acionadas con la generación y consumo de 
productos digitales, sino también para generar soluciones que mejoran las condiciones de vida de las personas 
más vulnerables de la sociedad. IDEO.org , por ejemplo, ha sido demostrado tener impacto positivo mediante la 
aplicación del enfoque DCH para producir soluciones que impactan la vida de personas en diferentes lugares del 
planeta.  
En ese sentido, La Alianza Bioversity -CIAT ha decidido adoptar el enfoque de DCH para garantizar que el desarrollo 
de nuevas herramientas —y la revisión y ajuste de las existentes — sea guiado por principios más cercanos a las 
necesidades y condiciones habi litantes de las personas para las que se hace investigación. De ahí que se haya 
defini do este enfoque como un proceso de cinco fases, que se basan en la i) identificación de un problema o desafío 
de diseño ( scope  o alcance), ii) la colección de información  de los usuarios ( explore  o exploración), iii) el diseño de 
prototipos ( create  o creación), iv) la evaluación de los prototipos en pilotos con usuarios y grupos de interés ( validate  
o validación) y, finalmente, v) la reanudación el ciclo de diseño a partir de una evaluación constante que tienen lugar 
durante la fase de escalamiento de la herramienta ( scale  o escalamiento) ( Figura 1). Como se puede observar, en 
cada una de las fases hay momentos divergencia (generación de ideas de manera profusa) y convergencia 
(concreción de esas ideas en temas y oportunidades de diseño) ( Figura 1). Esta dinámica es propia del ciclo de 
diseño, el cual es iterativo y siempre susceptible a mejorar.

Los resultados obtenidos hasta el momento son alentadores, en parte, por la unidad de visión que comparten 
nuestros socios con la Alianza , pues se reconoc e que el DCH ha permitido  —y permitirá a futuro — identificar con 
mayor claridad las necesidades de los usuarios.  
A continuación, se presenta el reporte  compuesto por tres secciones que describen cada una de las fases del ciclo 
de diseño  abarcadas a  la fecha (i.e., alcance  y exploración) ( Figura 1), y otra sección dedicada a las  reflexiones  
finales .

 Fases de alcance y exploración  
Fase 1: Alcance  
A partir de las consultas  sostenidas en mayo de 2023 con el equipo de la Alianza en Honduras y 
algunos de sus socios como InfoAgro , de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería (SAG) , y el Centro 
de Estudios Atmosféricos, Oceanográficos y S ísmicos (CENAOS)  de la Secretaría de Gestión de 
Riesgo y Contingencias Nacionales  s se identificó el desafío de diseño —o problemática a afrontar —
: Producir boletines y reportes agroclimáticos mejor adaptados a las necesidades de  
diferentes tipos de usuarios, e.g.,  agricultores/as, técnicos/as y tomadores de decisiones  de 
los socios de la  Alianza .  
 
Como parte de las actividades de la fase “Alcance”, en mayo también se realizó el taller denominado 
«Diseño centrado en el humano y perspectiva de género» cuyo objetivo fue sensibilizar a los profesionales de la 
Alianza que participan en proyectos de AgriLAC en Honduras , con el enfoque y su relación con la perspectiva de 
Género e Inclusión Social  (GIS) ; dos abordajes estrechamente relacionados. Los objetivos de esta actividad eran i) 
ayudar a entender el marco conceptual del enfoque de DCH —y relación intrínseca con GIS — para visualizar su 
potencial en el aumento de la adopción e inclusión de las herram ientas desarrolladas y, con base en esto, ii) alentar 
la aplicación del enfoque en los diferentes proyectos que se están desarrollando en el marco de AgriLAC.  En el 
taller s e presentaron elementos conceptuales sobre DCH y GIS , y se realizaron ejercicios sobre cómo identificar un 
desafío de diseño, transformar desafíos en oportunidades  y analizar el uso de herramientas a partir de un mapa de 
experiencia.  
 
Figura 2. Equipo AgriLAC de Honduras. Taller facilitado por Emmanuel Zapata -Caldas (Acción Climática e Inclusión Digital) y 
Fanny Howland (Género e Inclusión Social) . Fuente: Equipo AgriLAC  
Se contó con la participación  de 11 personas provenientes de Honduras, México y Colombia , y co n distintas 
formaciones académicas: agronomía, antropología, biología y estadística  (Figura 2). En las reflexiones  finales  del 
taller se mencionó que,  para desarrollar herramientas con  mayor adopción e inclusión , es necesario entender que 
la perspectiva de GIS va más allá de un número  específico de  mujeres y hombre s participando en talleres; más bien, 
se trata de la posibilidad de ser  lo suficientemente  incluyentes para entender mejor las diferentes perspectivas que 
tienen mujeres y hombres sobre la activid ad agropecuaria y las dinámicas del clima de los lugares donde viven y 
desarrollan sus actividades económicas . También se resaltó que , dada la experiencia  que se está generando en la

 Alianza alrede dor del enfoque de DCH , la institución  se encuentra en una posición única para orientar a donantes, 
otros centros de investigación  y socios  sobre las posibilidades que abre el DCH para aumentar l a adopción de los 
servicios climáticos existentes y lo s que se producirán en el futuro . 
El taller dio un impulso importante a los profesionales de la Alianza  en Honduras  para que adoptaran el enfoque  
DCH y lo implementaran en dos acciones específic as; i) la generación de un boletín agroclimático para agricultores 
y ii) un reporte agroclimático para técnicos y tomadores/as de decisiones de I NFOAGRO  y CENAOS. Esto se logró 
hacer de manera sistemática  gracias al desarrollo de un documento denominado plan de investigación de 
usuario ; hoja de ruta para hacer frente al desafío de diseño . En él se consignaron objetivos  y fases de investigación  
(Tabla 1).

Los objetivos de la investigación de usuario  fueron: i) conocer las percepciones de agricultores/as, técnicos/as y 
tomadores /as de decisiones frente a los boletines climáticos y agroclimáticos producidos por CENAOS, I NFOAGRO  
y las Mesas Técnicas Agroclimáticas (MTA); ii) generar tipologías de usuarios que acceden a la información 
agroclimática (creación de personas ); y iii) definir los canales de difusión de información agroclimática más 
adecuada según tipología de usuario.  A la fecha , se ha avanzado  en los dos primeros objetivo s. 
Fase 2: Explorar  
Para entender mejor a las personas con las que se co -diseña, es necesario conocer su contexto , y 
entrevistarlos para entender  sus necesidades, objetivos, capacidades, etc . Se realizaron 15 
entrevistas ; cinco a agricultores; cinco a técnicos y cinco a tomadores  de decisiones  (Figura 3). En 
el Anexo  1 se pueden consultar el instrumento (entrevista) aplicado . Adicionalmente, l a Figura 4 
describe  las actividades desarrolladas en fase “Explorar” ; i) actividades  exploración  para definir el 
desafío de diseño , ii) investigación de usuario (trabajo de campo), iii) sistematización de entrevistas , 
y iv) creación de personas. Todos ellas, insumos necesario s para crear las tipologías de usuario, o 
personas , en el departamento de El Paraíso. De momento,  la primera persona  generada es un 
agricultor del valle de Jamastrán  (Figura 5) al que  le dimos el nombre “Augusto” .  
 
Con el concepto personas  se hace referencia a un perfil de usuario idealizado que representa los deseos y 
necesidades de un subgrupo de una población objetivo . En ese sentido, l as personas  son el resultado de un análisis 
en profundidad de los actuales o futuros usuarios potenciales de su servicio  o herramienta, en este caso, de un 
boletín agroclimático . Además, r epresentan  objetivos, actitudes y patrones de comportamiento más que 
identificadores demográficos como la edad  o el género —que pueden formar parte de  la persona , pero no  son 
considerados como factores diferenciadores para crearl as—.

En ese sentido, “Augusto” será uno de los referentes a tener en cuenta para el desarrollo de boletines agroclimáticos 
y otros servicios climáticos que atiendan a las necesidades de los agricultores en  el departamento de El Paraíso . En 
términos técnicos, la imagen de Augusto fue generad a por la una herramienta de inteligencia artificial conocida 
como Midjourney , mientras que las descripciones de la biografía, objetivos, obstáculos, necesidades , capacidades, 
condiciones habilitantes y canales de información fueron obtenid as de la matriz de Excel con la sistematización de 
las entrevistas a agricultores realizadas durante la investigación  de usuario.  •Conversaciones iniciales con equipo de la Alianza

 Reflexiones finales  
El enfoque de DCH es una apuesta interesante para llevar a cabo investigación interdisciplinaria entre modeladores 
de clima, agrónomos, científicos sociales (e.  g., geógrafos, antropólogos, etc.), diseñadores industriales, ingenieros 
de sistemas y, por supuesto, agricultoras, agricultores, técnicas , técnicos  y socios . La experiencia generada hasta el 
momento indica que existe un gran interés en mejorar la forma en que se genera, comparte e interpreta la 
información agroclimática.  En este sentido, v ale la pena resaltar la importancia de avanzar paralelamente  en dos 
dimensiones; i) el diseño de herramientas intuitivas y de amplia d ifusión —camino en el que se está  avanzando de 
manera rápida — y ii) la generación de información agroclimática localizada y cada vez más precisa —entendiendo 
las dificultades que implica la generación de pronósticos climáticos —.  
Tras esta primera experiencia, que se basa principalmente en el desarrollo de las dos primeras fases del enfoque 
DCH (i.e., alcance  y exploración) (Figura 1), durante el 2024 se espera  continuar con la generación de personas  para 
técnicos/cas y tomadores/as de decisiones  y, posteriormente , con la preparación de prototipos  de boletines  y 
reportes agroclimáticos . Cuando se definan las versiones finales de los boletines y reportes, se harán pilotajes  para  
evaluar el nivel de adopción en los grupos poblacionales  que lo s implementen. En 2024 también se espera reportar 
los hallazgos de este proceso .

"10728","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o","Environment","Deforestation Dynamics in Peru. A Comprehensive Review of Land Use, Food Systems, and Socio-Economic Drivers The drivers of deforestation and land use change in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes are complex and interconnected, shaped by various factors, including agricultural expansion, wood extraction, mining, infrastructure development, climate change, and socio-economic factors. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of these drivers and their impacts on the environment and local communities. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that accounts for both direct and underlying drivers and the unique context of each region. Effective management strategies must consider the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of these challenges. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving forest governance, empowering local communities, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders are crucial steps to protecting Peru’s natural resources. These measures can help balance economic development with environmental conservation, ensuring the sustainable use of land and resources. Equally important is addressing the underlying social and economic factors that drive land use change, including poverty, population growth, and migration. These factors often exacerbate environmental degradation and need to be integrated into broader development and conservation strategies.
A holistic approach that acknowledges the distinct challenges faced by the Amazon and Andean regions, can contribute to face deforestation as well as ensure the well-being of local communities, biodiversity conservation, and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. Such an approach requires coordinated efforts from government, non-governmental organizations, local communities, and international partners to create effective and sustainable solutions.

The drivers of deforestation and land use change in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes are complex and 
interconnected, shaped by various factors, including agricultural expansion, wood extraction, mining, infrastructure 
development, climate change, and socio -economic factors. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of these 
drivers and their impacts on the environment and local communities.  Addressing these issues requires a 
comprehensive approach that accounts for both direct and underlying drivers and the unique context of each 
region. Effective management strategies must consider the ecological, s ocial, and economic dimensions of these 
challenges. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving forest governance, empowering local 
communities, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders are crucial steps to protecting Peru’s natural 
resources. These measures can help balance economic development with environmental conservation, ensuring 
the sustainable use of land and resources. Equally important is addressing the underlying social and economic 
factors that drive land use change, includi ng poverty, population growth, and migration. These factors often 
exacerbate environmental degradation and need to be integrated into broader development and conservation 
strategies.  
A holistic approach that acknowledges the distinct challenges faced by the Amazon and Andean regions, can 
contribute to face deforestation as well as ensure the well -being of local communities, biodiversity conservation, 
and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. Such an approach requires coordinated efforts fro m 
government, non -governmental organizations, local communities, and international partners to create effective and 
sustainable solutions.

ABSTRACT  
Page 5:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  4 
 Peru is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its unique geographical location and 
socioeconomic conditions (Oliver -Smith, 2014) . The country is particularly susceptible to climate change effects, 
such as increased frequency of extreme weather events, enhanced glacier retreat, loss of biodiversity, increased soil 
erosion risk, among others (Correa et al., 2016; Heikkinen, 2017; Zevallos and Lavado -Casimiro, 2022) . Smallholder 
farmers face significant challenges adapting to these changes, as their livelihoods are closely tied to natural 
resources (Heikkinen, 2017; Lennox, 2015) . Moreover, socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, food insecurity, poor 
health, and marginalization, exacerbate these vulnerabilities and make it difficult for communities to adapt 
(Heikkinen, 2021; Oliver -Smith, 2014) . 
In Peru, climate change has intensified hydrometeorological hazards, such as torrential rainfalls, floods, and glacier 
retreat, leading to migration within the country (Bergmann et al., 2021) . The country's geographic, economic, 
developmental, social, demographic, and environmental characteristics vary between its regions, making them 
vulnerable to different levels of climate change impacts (Hoffman and Grigera, 2013) . 
The climate hazards are exacerbated in the Peruvian Andes and Amazon because of the high levels of poverty and 
inequality, with major deficiencies in basic services and threats related to environmental degradation, climate 
change, and pressure on water sou rces in the coastal and Andean areas, resulting in social tension and violence 
centered on the environmental impacts of extractive industries and large infrastructure projects. Also, melting 
glaciers are shrinking dry -season water supplies, disrupting rura l highland society, and sparking migration (Hoffman 
and Grigera, 2013) . 
Climate hazards among other factors have push migration from the Andes highlands to the Amazon, together with 
aspiration of access new land (Ichikawa et al., 2014) . Immigrants from the Andes often move to the Amazon for better 
opportunities and resource access, contributing to deforestation and environmental degradation in the region 
(Menton and Cronkleton, 2019) . 
In turn, deforestation affects the carbon stock by releasing carbon stored in trees and soils, contributing to 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (Achard et al., 2014) . Loss of forest cover also reduces the capacity 
of forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. According to the IPCC Special 
Report on Climate Change and Land 2019 (IPCC, 2019a) , the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sector is the 
second largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, second only to burning fossil fuels. During 2007 -
2016, land use and land -use change are estimated to have generated net CO2 emissio ns of 5.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr -1 
(IPCC, 2019b) . Deforestation was the main cause of net CO2 emissions, as well as soil cultivation and oxidation of 
wood products, among others. In the western Amazon, specifically in the Madre de Dios region, forest loss was at 
an annual rate of -0.21% between 1999 and  2018 (Alarcón et al., 2021) . In addition, Asner et al. (2010)  reported that 
over 4.3 million ha of the Peruvian Amazon between 1999 and 2009, emissions from land use totaled 1.1% of the 
standing carbon and forest degradation increased regional carbon emissions by 47% over deforestation alone, 
while secondary regrowt h provided an 18% offset against total gross emissions.  
Peru is among the nations that have ratified the Paris Agreement. Through its Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), Peru has committed to reducing its annual GHG emissions by 30% in 2030 compared to a business -as-usual 
scenario. An established target  in these NDCs is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the 
forestry sector and land -use changes (LUCs) by 43.1 MtCO2eq by 2030, which represents more than the 50% of the 
total reduction committed by that year (MINAM, 2019) . In contrast, deforestation rates increased by 58% in 2009 -
2016 compared to 2001 -2008 (MINAM, 2016; Vázquez -Rowe et al., 2019) . In this sense, identifying and addressing 
the direct and underlying drivers of deforestation and land use change is essential for effective national strategies. 
This study aims to analyze these main drivers, particularly focusing on the interconnected re gions of the Andes and 
the Amazon.  
Some studies have been done to predict deforestation across the Peruvian Amazon, such as applying machine 
learning algorithms or other related tools. Using such methods could help improve strategies for reducing future 1 INTRODUCTION

 deforestation and preserving carbon stocks in Peru and other forest regions (Rojas et al., 2021) . Additionally, high 
spatial resolution monitoring of aboveground carbon density (ACD) and emissions (ACE) in Peru revealed a total of 
7.138 Pg C estimated for the country, with an annual ACE of 20.08 Tg C between the third quarters of 2017 and 
2018 (Csillik and Asner, 2020a) . This finding underscores the need for enhanced forest carbon management at scale 
to mitigate climate change.  
Understanding the impact of land management practices on soil carbon dynamics in Peruvian ecosystems is 
essential for implementing effective conservation and restoration policies. Oliver et al. (2017)  found that grazing and 
burning increased soil CO2 fluxes and decomposition rates in Peruvian montane grasslands. Still, long -term carbon 
storage in occluded light fractions and heavy fractions was not negatively impacted. This is useful for designing 
appropriate land -use management strategies that do not compromise the carbon storage capacity of these 
ecosystems.  
This document focuses on the Andes and Amazon conditions where climate hazards affect a large number of 
smallholders and produce the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. The insights gained from 
this study are crucial for informing po licy decisions and conservation efforts, not only in Peru but also in other regions 
facing similar challenges.  
2.1 NATURAL CAPITAL AND CLIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DEFORESTATION IN THE 
AMAZON AND ANDES  
The Amazon rainforest, a vital ecosystem for global carbon regulation and a significant reservoir of natural capital, 
is critical in mitigating climate change and preserving biodiversity (Azevedo et al., 2020; Gatti et al., 2021) . The 
interplay between the Andean and Amazonian ecosystems is crucial for regional climate regulation, underscoring 
the need for integrated conservation strategies that consider the dynamics of both regions. Coe et al. (2017)  noted 
that tropical forests play a direct role in maintaining low surface temperatures and high precipitation. Indigenous 
and local communities play a vital role in preserving the natural capital of these regions. Recognizing and integrating 
their traditi onal knowledge and practices is essential for effective and sustainable management of these ecosystems.  
On the other hand, forest degradation from selective logging and understory fires contributes to carbon emissions, 
potentially accounting for up to 40% of carbon loss in the region (Berenguer et al., 2014) . In this sense, some authors 
point out that addressing deforestation and degradation requires implementing policies that consider aspects such 
as reducing forest fires and increasing the area of secondary forests while avoiding further removal of primary forests 
(Arag ão et al., 2014; Azevedo et al., 2020) . Incentives for better forest management and integrating local, regional, 
national, and international policies are also noted as necessary to adapt to and mitigate climate change (Azevedo 
et al., 2020) . For instance, a study by Barua et al. (2012)  found that carbon payments could effectively reduce forest 
clearing and pointed out that an effective policy to combat tropical deforestation should jointly consider the forestry 
and cash -crop sectors. Some authors point out that policies and programs lik e Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) should support existing efforts towards forest sustainability and 
balance economic development with the protection of natural capital to ensure the long -term viability of these 
critical  ecosystems (Bottazzi et al., 2014; Galford et al., 2011) .  
In 2016, Aguiar et al. noted a decrease in deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, stabilizing around 6,000 km2 
yr−1 in the previous five years of their study. They stated that while a combination of factors contributed to the 
decreased deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, including creating protected areas, effective monitoring 
systems, and credit restriction m echanisms, several threats remained, such as rapidly expanding global markets for 
agricultural commodities, large -scale transportation and energy infrastructure projects, and weak institutions 
(Aguiar et al., 2016) . In contrast, Murugasan et al. (2019) , modeling deforestation scenarios, concluded that the 2 CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND VULNERABILITY IN 
THE ANDES AND AMAZON  
Page 7:

 Amazon Basin is at risk of significant deforestation, with the forested area predicted to be reduced by about half by 
2050 under the Business -as-Usual scenario and if the current rate of deforestation continues, the world´s forests 
could dissolve within th e next 100 years.  
On the other hand, the high Andes region is home to diverse ecosystems crucial in carbon sequestration and climate 
regulation, such as paramo grasslands, montane cloud forests, and high -altitude wetlands (Peña et al., 2011) . Andean 
forests act as strong sinks for aboveground carbon and have a high potential to serve as future carbon refuges 
(Duque et al., 2021) . As climate change continues to impact these regions, adaptive management strategies that 
can respond to evolving environmental conditions are crucial for the sustainability of these ecosystems and the 
communities that depend on them. For instance, montan e cloud forests in the high Andes, such as those in Manu 
National Park, Peru, are also significant carbon stores. Improved management of these ecosystems can generate 
additional income for rural communities by commercializing carbon credits (Gibbon et al., 2010) . Also, Andean 
peatlands are essential for carbon and nitrogen accumulation. Understanding the factors affecting the accumulation 
of these elements in peatlands is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change on these ecosystems (León and 
Oliván, 2014) . In addition, the Andean plateau contains significant soil organic carbon (SOC) reservoirs, which are 
vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic activities, such as changes in land use and water management 
(Muñoz et al., 2015) . 
The region faces numerous challenges, including land use change, deforestation, and climate change, which affect 
carbon storage and the livelihoods of local communities (Barrera et al., 2012) . Although several projects have been 
implemented to promote environmentally friendly farming practices and soil and water conservation techniques, 
economic development in the Andean region is often hampered by extreme poverty, low agricultural productivit y, 
and limited off -farm opportunities. Exploring sustainable economic opportunities, such as ecotourism and 
sustainable harvesting of non -timber forest products, could provide alternative income sources for local 
communities while contributing to conservat ion efforts.  
Deforestation and land -use change have been significant sources of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in South 
America, with pasture expansion, commercial cropland, and infrastructure development often noted as some of the 
main drivers (De Sy et al., 2015) . While there are policies in place aimed at protecting these ecosystems, challenges 
in implementation and enforcement remain significant. Strengthening governance and institutional capacities is 
crucial for the effective management of these regions. In th e Andean community countries, there is a bidirectional 
relationship between economic growth, consumption of energy, and CO 2 emissions (Koengkan et al., 2018) . To 
ensure the sustainable development and protection of these ecosystems, it is essential to implement effective land 
use policies, promote environmentally friendly practices, and address the economic and social challenges local 
communities face.  
2.1.1  Amazon ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The Amazon is a critical carbon sink in the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation. Its ecosystems, 
including the rainforest, peatlands, mangroves, and transitional forests, store substantial carbon. These ecosystems 
are essential for optimizing  conservation efforts and maintaining global climate stability.  
The Amazon rainforest has been a long -term net biomass sink, although the rate of carbon accumulation has 
decreased over recent decades (Brienen et al., 2015) . Rödig et al. (2018)  found that the Amazon rainforest gains 
0.56 GtC per year, driven by a mean gross primary productivity (GPP) of 25.1 tC ha-1 a-1 and a mean woody 
aboveground net primary productivity (wANPP) of 4.2 tC ha-1 a-1. The study also found that forest structure and 
successional states are essential factors in the relationship between productivity and biomass, highlighting the need 
for forest management strategies that consider these aspects.  
Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, but human disturbances, such as selective logging, 
understory fires, and habitat fragmentation, affect carbon stocks and emissions. Disturbed forests store 40% less 
aboveground carbon on average compar ed to undisturbed forests and are structurally similar to secondary forests. 
Carbon emissions from these disturbances are significant and could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from 
deforestation in the Amazon (Berenguer et al., 2014) . 
Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests in the tropics, contributing disproportionately to the 
carbon sequestration (Alongi, 2014) . The Brazilian Amazon has one of the largest areas of mangroves in the world, 
Page 8:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  7 
 storing substantial amounts of carbon. The mean ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves east of the Amazon River 
ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha-1, with the Amazon mangroves storing over twice the amount of carbon than upland 
evergreen forests and almost ten times the amount found in tropical dry forests (Kauffman et al., 2018) . However, 
potential carbon losses due to deforestation are of immediate concern, with rates greater than these ecosystems' 
carbon storage (Alongi, 2014) . 
The dry transitional forests in southern Amazonia have received less attention but represent important carbon -
cycling ecosystems (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . These forests exhibit higher leaf photosynthesis and total GPP 
due to drier soil conditions favoring dry deciduous tree species. Carbon allocation patterns are similar to those in 
wetter humid forests, with the dry forests of southern Amazonia acting as a scaled -down version of their humid 
counterparts (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . 
Amazonian peatlands store significant amounts of carbon, with tropical peatlands accounting for about half of the 
global peatland emitted carbon (Ribeiro et al., 2021) . For instance, the Amazon's Pastaza -Marañón Foreland Basin 
(PMFB) is among the largest known intact tropical peatland landscapes globally and is considered highly threatened 
due to human activities such as deforestation and agricultural expansion (Roucoux et al., 2017) . Peatlands in 
Amazonian Peru cover 35,600 ± 2133 km2 and contain 3.14 (0.44 -8.15) Pg C. Peatland pole forests, in particular, are 
identified as the most carbon -dense ecosystem in Amazonia (1391 ± 710 Mg C ha-1) (Draper et al., 2014) . Swindles 
(2018)  reported that the Aucayacu peatland in the PMFB is the oldest peatland in Amazonia, accumulating peat up 
to 7.5 meters deep in approximately 8,900 years.  
These ecosystems face various threats, including deforestation, agricultural expansion, and climate change. The 
preservation of these ecosystems is not only crucial for carbon sequestration but also for maintaining biodiversity 
and supporting local communi ties. It is crucial to protect these ecosystems and support their role as carbon sinks to 
maintain global climate stability and ensure the success of the Paris Climate Agreement (Walker et al., 2020) . 
Peruvian amazon has several concrete examples of ecosystems that play a key role in mitigating climate change by 
acting as carbon sinks such as palm swamp peatlands and high -altitude grasslands. Understanding their carbon 
storage and dynamics is essential for developing effective conservation and restoration policies (Guerrero -Palomino 
et al., 2022; Hastie et al., 2022; Mu ñoz et al., 2015) . 
Amazon palm swamp peatlands are major carbon sinks and reservoirs, storing significant amounts of carbon 
alongside Andean forests with a strong carbon sink capacity (0.67 ± 0.08 Mg C ha−1 y−1)  (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque 
et al., 2021) . However, these ecosystems are threatened due to deforestation and land -use changes, with the 
Peruvian Amazon losing around 190,000 hectares of forest in 2020 alone (Dourojeanni, 2022) . The ongoing 
degradation of these ecosystems can potentially disrupt peat accretion and reduce carbon stocks, emphasizing the 
need for sustainable management and protection (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque et al., 2021) . 
2.1.2  Andean ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The High Andean ecosystems, such as wetlands, forests, grasslands, and the paramo, puna, and southern Andean 
steppe habitats, are characterized by unique environmental conditions and diverse flora and fauna that contribute 
to various ecosystem services, in cluding carbon accumulation and sequestration (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; 
Arroyo and Cavieres, 2013) . These ecosystems play a critical role in mitigating climate change by storing significant 
amounts of carbon in aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and organic soil (Gibbon et al., 2010; Segnini 
et al., 2011) .  
High Andean wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other habitats are known for their substantial carbon storage 
capacity due to their low decomposition rates, which result from flooded soils, low temperatures, and low soil pH 
(Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Mu ñoz et al., 2015; Oliveras et al., 2014) . Research has shown that these ecosystems store 
significant amounts of carbon in aboveground and belowground biomass, as well as in organic soil, with the latter 
accounting for the highest carbon storage (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Girardin et al., 2014; V ásquez et al., 2014) . In a 
study centered on the cloud forest -grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru, Gibbon et al. 
(2010)  found that the puna grasslands stored 7.5 ± 0.7 Mg C ha-1 in aboveground biomass, while the forest near the 
treeline contained 63.4 ± 5.2 Mg C ha-1 aboveground and an additional 13.9 ± 2.8 Mg C ha-1 in the coarse roots.  
Page 9:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  8 
 The unique environmental conditions of the High Andean ecosystems, such as cold and wet climate, low 
atmospheric pressure, and low soil pH, contribute to the accumulation of organic matter and carbon storage (Muñoz 
et al., 2015, 2013) . Organic matter decomposes very slowly in these conditions, and its content increases with altitude. 
Approximately 40 -60% of the soil organic carbon (OC) exists within the top 20 -cm layer, with a high C/N ratio in the 
Andean highlands indicating intense h umification (Muñoz et al., 2015) . Segnini et al . (2011)  determined carbon 
contents and carbon stocks in five Peruvian agroecologies along a 1,000 km transect and found that soils in the 
tropical highland rainforest site had the highest carbon contents (134 g kg -1 [13.4%]) and that diversified production 
systems with crops and livestock were more stable for carbon stocks.  
Human activities, such as grazing, burning, and land use changes, can negatively impact the carbon storage capacity 
of high Andean ecosystems and their biodiversity (Muñoz et al., 2013; Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . These 
disturbances can reduce the net primary productivity (NPP) of the puna grasslands and result in the loss of grasslands 
and montane forests due to agriculture and other land use changes (Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . 
Consequently, it is essential to implement strategies to protect these ecosystems and their essential functions, 
including their roles as stable carbon reservoirs and habitats for threatened species.  
The tropical montane forest ecosystems of the Peruvian Andes are under threat from climate change, which is 
expected to have a high potential impact on 58% of all montane forests, particularly in the elevation range between 
800 and 1200 m.a.s.l (Bax et al., 2021) . Moreover, about 64% of montane forests in protected areas will be exposed 
to high potential impact. Enhancing the adaptive capacity of these ecosystems through restorative and preventive 
conservation measures, such as improving forest functions and mitig ating deforestation and forest degradation 
pressures, is crucial for their survival (Bax et al., 2021) . 
Andean peatlands, particularly those formed by cushion plants, and high -altitude grasslands in the Andean plateau, 
such as the puna, are vital carbon sinks in Peru. These peatlands and grasslands are influenced by climate change 
and human activities, such as grazing, ditching, and unsuitable water management, which alter hydrologic 
conditions and degrade these essential carbon reservoirs (Muñoz et al., 2015; Planas -Clarke et al., 2020) . Hydrologic 
restoration, such as rewetting of moderately drained peatlands, could help moderate climate change's impacts on 
Andean peatlands and increase their ability to store carbon (Planas -Clarke et al., 2020)  
2.2 Vulnerability to climate change in Peru  
Climate change poses significant risks to Peru, making the country highly vulnerable to food insecurity, floods, 
landslides, water scarcity, vector -borne diseases, coastal risks, and systemic failures due to cascading impacts of 
hazards and epidemics, amon g others (Hagen et al., 2022) . Inequities in water governance and changes in the 
hydrology of Peru due to glacial retreat are magnifying vulnerabilities in communities, food producers, and poor 
urban neighbourhoods  (Lynch, 2012) . These challenges underscore the need for comprehensive and inclusive 
approaches to water management and climate adaptation strategies. Various adaptation measures have been 
identified to address these risks, but the low adaptive capacity and climate chan ge may limit their effectiveness 
(Hagen et al., 2022) . Furthermore, there is a need for increased investment in building adaptive capacities at local 
and national levels to enhance resilience against climate change. Additionally, adaptation strategies have limited 
attention, which is insufficient for the cou ntry (Takahashi and Meisner, 2012) . 
Climate change affects the food systems in Peru, with implications for agricultural production, food security, and the 
livelihoods of smallholder farmers (Lozano -Povis et al., 2021; Tito et al., 2018) . The Andean region is highly 
vulnerable to climate change, with increased rainfall intensity, soil erosion, retreat of glaciers, and loss of vegetation 
cover, all impacting crop dynamics. Innovative agricultural practices and technologies, such as climate -smart 
agriculture, are essential to adapt to these changing conditions.  In this regard, Peru's food production and crop 
yields are also negatively affected, especially for crops such as quinoa, potatoes, and tarwi (Lozano -Povis et al., 
2021) . 
One of the primary challenges to Peru's food systems is ensuring adequate food production and security in the face 
of climate change. Rising temperatures can lead to declining crop yields, forcing farmers to change cultivation 
practices or relocate their c rops to higher elevations. However, such changes may also result in the introduction of 
novel pests and a decline in crop quality and value, leading to severe economic losses for local farmers and food 
insecurity (Tito et al., 2018) . 
Page 10:

 2.2.1  Climate -related hazard for the Andes and Amazon  
The climate -related hazards in Peru pose significant threats to the diverse environments, ranging from coastal 
deserts to high Andean mountains and humid Amazon lowlands (Young and Le ón, 2009) . Population growth and urban 
expansion increase the vulnerability of communities to these hazards, which include floods, landslides, glacial 
retreat, and extreme weather events (Oliver -Smith, 2014; Vil ímek et al., 2005) . 
El Niño events are one of the primary climate -related hazards in Peru, causing intense rainfall, ponding water, flash 
floods, and landslides, leading to significant damage to society (Brill et al., 2020) . Damage modelling  based on data -
mining methods and remote sensing products, are some tools used in risk assessments. The integration of these 
advanced technologies with traditional knowledge systems can enhance the accuracy and relevance of risk 
assessments. Also, the topo graphic wetness index and the slope length and steepness factor are crucial features in 
classifying damage from compound natural hazards like El Niño events (Brill et al., 2020) . 
On the other hand, glacier retreat in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range has led to the formation of glacial lakes, 
posing a risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) (Vilímek et al., 2014) . GLOFs are closely connected with dynamic 
slope movements, such as ice - and rock -falls and landslides of steep moraine slopes, accounting for around 80% of 
GLOFs in the region. These outburst floods can lead to highly hazardous debris and mudflows, signif icantly 
impacting the high mountainous environment (Vilímek et al., 2014) . Despite efforts by a Peruvian glaciology and lakes 
security office, glacier disasters killed nearly 30,000 people in five glacier -related disasters in Peru´s Cordillera 
Blanca from 1941 to 1970 (Carey, 2005) . A lack of trust between local communities and government officials has 
exacerbated the problem, where many residents live in hazard zones.  
Andean populations are vulnerable to climate change and disasters due to poverty, food insecurity, poor health, 
and marginalization. According to Oliver -Smith (2014) , to address these vulnerabilities, adaptation policies must 
integrate measures to reduce specific hazards with programs aimed at reducing systemic vulnerabilities and societal 
inequality. This approach should include empowering local communities and ensur ing their active participation in 
decision -making processes.  
Addressing climate -related hazards in Peru requires a better understanding and integration of scientific knowledge 
and local expertise (Salzmann et al., 2009) . For example, physically -based numerical models can help simulate

ABSTRACT  
Page 5:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  4 
 Peru is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its unique geographical location and 
socioeconomic conditions (Oliver -Smith, 2014) . The country is particularly susceptible to climate change effects, 
such as increased frequency of extreme weather events, enhanced glacier retreat, loss of biodiversity, increased soil 
erosion risk, among others (Correa et al., 2016; Heikkinen, 2017; Zevallos and Lavado -Casimiro, 2022) . Smallholder 
farmers face significant challenges adapting to these changes, as their livelihoods are closely tied to natural 
resources (Heikkinen, 2017; Lennox, 2015) . Moreover, socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, food insecurity, poor 
health, and marginalization, exacerbate these vulnerabilities and make it difficult for communities to adapt 
(Heikkinen, 2021; Oliver -Smith, 2014) . 
In Peru, climate change has intensified hydrometeorological hazards, such as torrential rainfalls, floods, and glacier 
retreat, leading to migration within the country (Bergmann et al., 2021) . The country's geographic, economic, 
developmental, social, demographic, and environmental characteristics vary between its regions, making them 
vulnerable to different levels of climate change impacts (Hoffman and Grigera, 2013) . 
The climate hazards are exacerbated in the Peruvian Andes and Amazon because of the high levels of poverty and 
inequality, with major deficiencies in basic services and threats related to environmental degradation, climate 
change, and pressure on water sou rces in the coastal and Andean areas, resulting in social tension and violence 
centered on the environmental impacts of extractive industries and large infrastructure projects. Also, melting 
glaciers are shrinking dry -season water supplies, disrupting rura l highland society, and sparking migration (Hoffman 
and Grigera, 2013) . 
Climate hazards among other factors have push migration from the Andes highlands to the Amazon, together with 
aspiration of access new land (Ichikawa et al., 2014) . Immigrants from the Andes often move to the Amazon for better 
opportunities and resource access, contributing to deforestation and environmental degradation in the region 
(Menton and Cronkleton, 2019) . 
In turn, deforestation affects the carbon stock by releasing carbon stored in trees and soils, contributing to 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (Achard et al., 2014) . Loss of forest cover also reduces the capacity 
of forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. According to the IPCC Special 
Report on Climate Change and Land 2019 (IPCC, 2019a) , the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sector is the 
second largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, second only to burning fossil fuels. During 2007 -
2016, land use and land -use change are estimated to have generated net CO2 emissio ns of 5.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr -1 
(IPCC, 2019b) . Deforestation was the main cause of net CO2 emissions, as well as soil cultivation and oxidation of 
wood products, among others. In the western Amazon, specifically in the Madre de Dios region, forest loss was at 
an annual rate of -0.21% between 1999 and  2018 (Alarcón et al., 2021) . In addition, Asner et al. (2010)  reported that 
over 4.3 million ha of the Peruvian Amazon between 1999 and 2009, emissions from land use totaled 1.1% of the 
standing carbon and forest degradation increased regional carbon emissions by 47% over deforestation alone, 
while secondary regrowt h provided an 18% offset against total gross emissions.  
Peru is among the nations that have ratified the Paris Agreement. Through its Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), Peru has committed to reducing its annual GHG emissions by 30% in 2030 compared to a business -as-usual 
scenario. An established target  in these NDCs is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the 
forestry sector and land -use changes (LUCs) by 43.1 MtCO2eq by 2030, which represents more than the 50% of the 
total reduction committed by that year (MINAM, 2019) . In contrast, deforestation rates increased by 58% in 2009 -
2016 compared to 2001 -2008 (MINAM, 2016; Vázquez -Rowe et al., 2019) . In this sense, identifying and addressing 
the direct and underlying drivers of deforestation and land use change is essential for effective national strategies. 
This study aims to analyze these main drivers, particularly focusing on the interconnected re gions of the Andes and 
the Amazon.  
Some studies have been done to predict deforestation across the Peruvian Amazon, such as applying machine 
learning algorithms or other related tools. Using such methods could help improve strategies for reducing future 1 INTRODUCTION

 deforestation and preserving carbon stocks in Peru and other forest regions (Rojas et al., 2021) . Additionally, high 
spatial resolution monitoring of aboveground carbon density (ACD) and emissions (ACE) in Peru revealed a total of 
7.138 Pg C estimated for the country, with an annual ACE of 20.08 Tg C between the third quarters of 2017 and 
2018 (Csillik and Asner, 2020a) . This finding underscores the need for enhanced forest carbon management at scale 
to mitigate climate change.  
Understanding the impact of land management practices on soil carbon dynamics in Peruvian ecosystems is 
essential for implementing effective conservation and restoration policies. Oliver et al. (2017)  found that grazing and 
burning increased soil CO2 fluxes and decomposition rates in Peruvian montane grasslands. Still, long -term carbon 
storage in occluded light fractions and heavy fractions was not negatively impacted. This is useful for designing 
appropriate land -use management strategies that do not compromise the carbon storage capacity of these 
ecosystems.  
This document focuses on the Andes and Amazon conditions where climate hazards affect a large number of 
smallholders and produce the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. The insights gained from 
this study are crucial for informing po licy decisions and conservation efforts, not only in Peru but also in other regions 
facing similar challenges.  
2.1 NATURAL CAPITAL AND CLIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DEFORESTATION IN THE 
AMAZON AND ANDES  
The Amazon rainforest, a vital ecosystem for global carbon regulation and a significant reservoir of natural capital, 
is critical in mitigating climate change and preserving biodiversity (Azevedo et al., 2020; Gatti et al., 2021) . The 
interplay between the Andean and Amazonian ecosystems is crucial for regional climate regulation, underscoring 
the need for integrated conservation strategies that consider the dynamics of both regions. Coe et al. (2017)  noted 
that tropical forests play a direct role in maintaining low surface temperatures and high precipitation. Indigenous 
and local communities play a vital role in preserving the natural capital of these regions. Recognizing and integrating 
their traditi onal knowledge and practices is essential for effective and sustainable management of these ecosystems.  
On the other hand, forest degradation from selective logging and understory fires contributes to carbon emissions, 
potentially accounting for up to 40% of carbon loss in the region (Berenguer et al., 2014) . In this sense, some authors 
point out that addressing deforestation and degradation requires implementing policies that consider aspects such 
as reducing forest fires and increasing the area of secondary forests while avoiding further removal of primary forests 
(Arag ão et al., 2014; Azevedo et al., 2020) . Incentives for better forest management and integrating local, regional, 
national, and international policies are also noted as necessary to adapt to and mitigate climate change (Azevedo 
et al., 2020) . For instance, a study by Barua et al. (2012)  found that carbon payments could effectively reduce forest 
clearing and pointed out that an effective policy to combat tropical deforestation should jointly consider the forestry 
and cash -crop sectors. Some authors point out that policies and programs lik e Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) should support existing efforts towards forest sustainability and 
balance economic development with the protection of natural capital to ensure the long -term viability of these 
critical  ecosystems (Bottazzi et al., 2014; Galford et al., 2011) .  
In 2016, Aguiar et al. noted a decrease in deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, stabilizing around 6,000 km2 
yr−1 in the previous five years of their study. They stated that while a combination of factors contributed to the 
decreased deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, including creating protected areas, effective monitoring 
systems, and credit restriction m echanisms, several threats remained, such as rapidly expanding global markets for 
agricultural commodities, large -scale transportation and energy infrastructure projects, and weak institutions 
(Aguiar et al., 2016) . In contrast, Murugasan et al. (2019) , modeling deforestation scenarios, concluded that the 2 CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND VULNERABILITY IN 
THE ANDES AND AMAZON

 Amazon Basin is at risk of significant deforestation, with the forested area predicted to be reduced by about half by 
2050 under the Business -as-Usual scenario and if the current rate of deforestation continues, the world´s forests 
could dissolve within th e next 100 years.  
On the other hand, the high Andes region is home to diverse ecosystems crucial in carbon sequestration and climate 
regulation, such as paramo grasslands, montane cloud forests, and high -altitude wetlands (Peña et al., 2011) . Andean 
forests act as strong sinks for aboveground carbon and have a high potential to serve as future carbon refuges 
(Duque et al., 2021) . As climate change continues to impact these regions, adaptive management strategies that 
can respond to evolving environmental conditions are crucial for the sustainability of these ecosystems and the 
communities that depend on them. For instance, montan e cloud forests in the high Andes, such as those in Manu 
National Park, Peru, are also significant carbon stores. Improved management of these ecosystems can generate 
additional income for rural communities by commercializing carbon credits (Gibbon et al., 2010) . Also, Andean 
peatlands are essential for carbon and nitrogen accumulation. Understanding the factors affecting the accumulation 
of these elements in peatlands is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change on these ecosystems (León and 
Oliván, 2014) . In addition, the Andean plateau contains significant soil organic carbon (SOC) reservoirs, which are 
vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic activities, such as changes in land use and water management 
(Muñoz et al., 2015) . 
The region faces numerous challenges, including land use change, deforestation, and climate change, which affect 
carbon storage and the livelihoods of local communities (Barrera et al., 2012) . Although several projects have been 
implemented to promote environmentally friendly farming practices and soil and water conservation techniques, 
economic development in the Andean region is often hampered by extreme poverty, low agricultural productivit y, 
and limited off -farm opportunities. Exploring sustainable economic opportunities, such as ecotourism and 
sustainable harvesting of non -timber forest products, could provide alternative income sources for local 
communities while contributing to conservat ion efforts.  
Deforestation and land -use change have been significant sources of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in South 
America, with pasture expansion, commercial cropland, and infrastructure development often noted as some of the 
main drivers (De Sy et al., 2015) . While there are policies in place aimed at protecting these ecosystems, challenges 
in implementation and enforcement remain significant. Strengthening governance and institutional capacities is 
crucial for the effective management of these regions. In th e Andean community countries, there is a bidirectional 
relationship between economic growth, consumption of energy, and CO 2 emissions (Koengkan et al., 2018) . To 
ensure the sustainable development and protection of these ecosystems, it is essential to implement effective land 
use policies, promote environmentally friendly practices, and address the economic and social challenges local 
communities face.  
2.1.1  Amazon ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The Amazon is a critical carbon sink in the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation. Its ecosystems, 
including the rainforest, peatlands, mangroves, and transitional forests, store substantial carbon. These ecosystems 
are essential for optimizing  conservation efforts and maintaining global climate stability.  
The Amazon rainforest has been a long -term net biomass sink, although the rate of carbon accumulation has 
decreased over recent decades (Brienen et al., 2015) . Rödig et al. (2018)  found that the Amazon rainforest gains 
0.56 GtC per year, driven by a mean gross primary productivity (GPP) of 25.1 tC ha-1 a-1 and a mean woody 
aboveground net primary productivity (wANPP) of 4.2 tC ha-1 a-1. The study also found that forest structure and 
successional states are essential factors in the relationship between productivity and biomass, highlighting the need 
for forest management strategies that consider these aspects.  
Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, but human disturbances, such as selective logging, 
understory fires, and habitat fragmentation, affect carbon stocks and emissions. Disturbed forests store 40% less 
aboveground carbon on average compar ed to undisturbed forests and are structurally similar to secondary forests. 
Carbon emissions from these disturbances are significant and could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from 
deforestation in the Amazon (Berenguer et al., 2014) . 
Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests in the tropics, contributing disproportionately to the 
carbon sequestration (Alongi, 2014) . The Brazilian Amazon has one of the largest areas of mangroves in the world, 
Page 8:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  7 
 storing substantial amounts of carbon. The mean ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves east of the Amazon River 
ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha-1, with the Amazon mangroves storing over twice the amount of carbon than upland 
evergreen forests and almost ten times the amount found in tropical dry forests (Kauffman et al., 2018) . However, 
potential carbon losses due to deforestation are of immediate concern, with rates greater than these ecosystems' 
carbon storage (Alongi, 2014) . 
The dry transitional forests in southern Amazonia have received less attention but represent important carbon -
cycling ecosystems (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . These forests exhibit higher leaf photosynthesis and total GPP 
due to drier soil conditions favoring dry deciduous tree species. Carbon allocation patterns are similar to those in 
wetter humid forests, with the dry forests of southern Amazonia acting as a scaled -down version of their humid 
counterparts (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . 
Amazonian peatlands store significant amounts of carbon, with tropical peatlands accounting for about half of the 
global peatland emitted carbon (Ribeiro et al., 2021) . For instance, the Amazon's Pastaza -Marañón Foreland Basin 
(PMFB) is among the largest known intact tropical peatland landscapes globally and is considered highly threatened 
due to human activities such as deforestation and agricultural expansion (Roucoux et al., 2017) . Peatlands in 
Amazonian Peru cover 35,600 ± 2133 km2 and contain 3.14 (0.44 -8.15) Pg C. Peatland pole forests, in particular, are 
identified as the most carbon -dense ecosystem in Amazonia (1391 ± 710 Mg C ha-1) (Draper et al., 2014) . Swindles 
(2018)  reported that the Aucayacu peatland in the PMFB is the oldest peatland in Amazonia, accumulating peat up 
to 7.5 meters deep in approximately 8,900 years.  
These ecosystems face various threats, including deforestation, agricultural expansion, and climate change. The 
preservation of these ecosystems is not only crucial for carbon sequestration but also for maintaining biodiversity 
and supporting local communi ties. It is crucial to protect these ecosystems and support their role as carbon sinks to 
maintain global climate stability and ensure the success of the Paris Climate Agreement (Walker et al., 2020) . 
Peruvian amazon has several concrete examples of ecosystems that play a key role in mitigating climate change by 
acting as carbon sinks such as palm swamp peatlands and high -altitude grasslands. Understanding their carbon 
storage and dynamics is essential for developing effective conservation and restoration policies (Guerrero -Palomino 
et al., 2022; Hastie et al., 2022; Mu ñoz et al., 2015) . 
Amazon palm swamp peatlands are major carbon sinks and reservoirs, storing significant amounts of carbon 
alongside Andean forests with a strong carbon sink capacity (0.67 ± 0.08 Mg C ha−1 y−1)  (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque 
et al., 2021) . However, these ecosystems are threatened due to deforestation and land -use changes, with the 
Peruvian Amazon losing around 190,000 hectares of forest in 2020 alone (Dourojeanni, 2022) . The ongoing 
degradation of these ecosystems can potentially disrupt peat accretion and reduce carbon stocks, emphasizing the 
need for sustainable management and protection (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque et al., 2021) . 
2.1.2  Andean ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The High Andean ecosystems, such as wetlands, forests, grasslands, and the paramo, puna, and southern Andean 
steppe habitats, are characterized by unique environmental conditions and diverse flora and fauna that contribute 
to various ecosystem services, in cluding carbon accumulation and sequestration (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; 
Arroyo and Cavieres, 2013) . These ecosystems play a critical role in mitigating climate change by storing significant 
amounts of carbon in aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and organic soil (Gibbon et al., 2010; Segnini 
et al., 2011) .  
High Andean wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other habitats are known for their substantial carbon storage 
capacity due to their low decomposition rates, which result from flooded soils, low temperatures, and low soil pH 
(Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Mu ñoz et al., 2015; Oliveras et al., 2014) . Research has shown that these ecosystems store 
significant amounts of carbon in aboveground and belowground biomass, as well as in organic soil, with the latter 
accounting for the highest carbon storage (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Girardin et al., 2014; V ásquez et al., 2014) . In a 
study centered on the cloud forest -grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru, Gibbon et al. 
(2010)  found that the puna grasslands stored 7.5 ± 0.7 Mg C ha-1 in aboveground biomass, while the forest near the 
treeline contained 63.4 ± 5.2 Mg C ha-1 aboveground and an additional 13.9 ± 2.8 Mg C ha-1 in the coarse roots.  
Page 9:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  8 
 The unique environmental conditions of the High Andean ecosystems, such as cold and wet climate, low 
atmospheric pressure, and low soil pH, contribute to the accumulation of organic matter and carbon storage (Muñoz 
et al., 2015, 2013) . Organic matter decomposes very slowly in these conditions, and its content increases with altitude. 
Approximately 40 -60% of the soil organic carbon (OC) exists within the top 20 -cm layer, with a high C/N ratio in the 
Andean highlands indicating intense h umification (Muñoz et al., 2015) . Segnini et al . (2011)  determined carbon 
contents and carbon stocks in five Peruvian agroecologies along a 1,000 km transect and found that soils in the 
tropical highland rainforest site had the highest carbon contents (134 g kg -1 [13.4%]) and that diversified production 
systems with crops and livestock were more stable for carbon stocks.  
Human activities, such as grazing, burning, and land use changes, can negatively impact the carbon storage capacity 
of high Andean ecosystems and their biodiversity (Muñoz et al., 2013; Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . These 
disturbances can reduce the net primary productivity (NPP) of the puna grasslands and result in the loss of grasslands 
and montane forests due to agriculture and other land use changes (Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . 
Consequently, it is essential to implement strategies to protect these ecosystems and their essential functions, 
including their roles as stable carbon reservoirs and habitats for threatened species.  
The tropical montane forest ecosystems of the Peruvian Andes are under threat from climate change, which is 
expected to have a high potential impact on 58% of all montane forests, particularly in the elevation range between 
800 and 1200 m.a.s.l (Bax et al., 2021) . Moreover, about 64% of montane forests in protected areas will be exposed 
to high potential impact. Enhancing the adaptive capacity of these ecosystems through restorative and preventive 
conservation measures, such as improving forest functions and mitig ating deforestation and forest degradation 
pressures, is crucial for their survival (Bax et al., 2021) . 
Andean peatlands, particularly those formed by cushion plants, and high -altitude grasslands in the Andean plateau, 
such as the puna, are vital carbon sinks in Peru. These peatlands and grasslands are influenced by climate change 
and human activities, such as grazing, ditching, and unsuitable water management, which alter hydrologic 
conditions and degrade these essential carbon reservoirs (Muñoz et al., 2015; Planas -Clarke et al., 2020) . Hydrologic 
restoration, such as rewetting of moderately drained peatlands, could help moderate climate change's impacts on 
Andean peatlands and increase their ability to store carbon (Planas -Clarke et al., 2020)  
2.2 Vulnerability to climate change in Peru  
Climate change poses significant risks to Peru, making the country highly vulnerable to food insecurity, floods, 
landslides, water scarcity, vector -borne diseases, coastal risks, and systemic failures due to cascading impacts of 
hazards and epidemics, amon g others (Hagen et al., 2022) . Inequities in water governance and changes in the 
hydrology of Peru due to glacial retreat are magnifying vulnerabilities in communities, food producers, and poor 
urban neighbourhoods  (Lynch, 2012) . These challenges underscore the need for comprehensive and inclusive 
approaches to water management and climate adaptation strategies. Various adaptation measures have been 
identified to address these risks, but the low adaptive capacity and climate chan ge may limit their effectiveness 
(Hagen et al., 2022) . Furthermore, there is a need for increased investment in building adaptive capacities at local 
and national levels to enhance resilience against climate change. Additionally, adaptation strategies have limited 
attention, which is insufficient for the cou ntry (Takahashi and Meisner, 2012) . 
Climate change affects the food systems in Peru, with implications for agricultural production, food security, and the 
livelihoods of smallholder farmers (Lozano -Povis et al., 2021; Tito et al., 2018) . The Andean region is highly 
vulnerable to climate change, with increased rainfall intensity, soil erosion, retreat of glaciers, and loss of vegetation 
cover, all impacting crop dynamics. Innovative agricultural practices and technologies, such as climate -smart 
agriculture, are essential to adapt to these changing conditions.  In this regard, Peru's food production and crop 
yields are also negatively affected, especially for crops such as quinoa, potatoes, and tarwi (Lozano -Povis et al., 
2021) . 
One of the primary challenges to Peru's food systems is ensuring adequate food production and security in the face 
of climate change. Rising temperatures can lead to declining crop yields, forcing farmers to change cultivation 
practices or relocate their c rops to higher elevations. However, such changes may also result in the introduction of 
novel pests and a decline in crop quality and value, leading to severe economic losses for local farmers and food 
insecurity (Tito et al., 2018) .

 2.2.1  Climate -related hazard for the Andes and Amazon  
The climate -related hazards in Peru pose significant threats to the diverse environments, ranging from coastal 
deserts to high Andean mountains and humid Amazon lowlands (Young and Le ón, 2009) . Population growth and urban 
expansion increase the vulnerability of communities to these hazards, which include floods, landslides, glacial 
retreat, and extreme weather events (Oliver -Smith, 2014; Vil ímek et al., 2005) . 
El Niño events are one of the primary climate -related hazards in Peru, causing intense rainfall, ponding water, flash 
floods, and landslides, leading to significant damage to society (Brill et al., 2020) . Damage modelling  based on data -
mining methods and remote sensing products, are some tools used in risk assessments. The integration of these 
advanced technologies with traditional knowledge systems can enhance the accuracy and relevance of risk 
assessments. Also, the topo graphic wetness index and the slope length and steepness factor are crucial features in 
classifying damage from compound natural hazards like El Niño events (Brill et al., 2020) . 
On the other hand, glacier retreat in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range has led to the formation of glacial lakes, 
posing a risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) (Vilímek et al., 2014) . GLOFs are closely connected with dynamic 
slope movements, such as ice - and rock -falls and landslides of steep moraine slopes, accounting for around 80% of 
GLOFs in the region. These outburst floods can lead to highly hazardous debris and mudflows, signif icantly 
impacting the high mountainous environment (Vilímek et al., 2014) . Despite efforts by a Peruvian glaciology and lakes 
security office, glacier disasters killed nearly 30,000 people in five glacier -related disasters in Peru´s Cordillera 
Blanca from 1941 to 1970 (Carey, 2005) . A lack of trust between local communities and government officials has 
exacerbated the problem, where many residents live in hazard zones.  
Andean populations are vulnerable to climate change and disasters due to poverty, food insecurity, poor health, 
and marginalization. According to Oliver -Smith (2014) , to address these vulnerabilities, adaptation policies must 
integrate measures to reduce specific hazards with programs aimed at reducing systemic vulnerabilities and societal 
inequality. This approach should include empowering local communities and ensur ing their active participation in 
decision -making processes.  
Addressing climate -related hazards in Peru requires a better understanding and integration of scientific knowledge 
and local expertise (Salzmann et al., 2009) . For example, physically -based numerical models can help simulate

Report 2023 & Outlook 2024
In India, the CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive Solutions works in remote parts of 
Western India’s Maharashtra State. NATURE+ and its partners selected several sites 
(called clusters) for their high potential for implementing nature-positive activities to 
improve nutrition, climate resilience, food security and to conserve nature. People in 
these tribal areas also have rich traditional knowledge that is key to natural solutions. Nature-Positive Solutions Initiative Country Overview
Page 2:
What is NATURE+?
The CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive Solutions 
aims to re-imagine, collaboratively create and 
implement nature-positive solutions for agri-
food systems that equitably support food and 
livelihoods and ensure that agriculture is a net-
positive contributor to biodiversity and nature.
The challenges
There are several challenges to a nature-positive 
transition in India. There is limited local-level data on 
available resources and their utilization for nature-
positive land use. There is a general lack of awareness 
on the efficient use of resources. There is little to no 
market for sustainable circular economy business 
models. Financing for nature-based solutions at the 
individual or farm level remains low.
The NATURE+ approach
The Initiative works in collaboration with highly capable 
partner organizations that specialize in activities related 
to agricultural management and production. In addition, 
NATURE+ collaborates with relevant on-the-ground 
stakeholders to assess, develop, implement, and sustain 
nature-positive solutions in agri-food systems to ensure 
income generation, improve biodiversity, and deliver 
a net-positive impact of agriculture on nature. The 
Initiative creates opportunities to access the broader 
food basket through more nutrient-rich crop varieties to 
help develop more resilient and adaptable farming and 
seed systems. The opportunities
To provide strong institutional support in India for a 
transition to nature-based solutions, NATURE+ works to 
enhance income opportunities (particularly for women, 
youth and indigenous peoples) through value chains 
related to seeds, crops, fruit trees, waste, payment for 
ecosystem services, and public procurement. Improved 
restoration and soil management efforts, as well as 
improved recycling value chains, will create highly valued 
carbon sinks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Where NATURE+ works 
In India, the CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive 
Solutions   works in two clusters, Akole and Nandurbar, 
Maharashtra.
NATURE+ study areas in India (represented in terms of 
administrative boundaries).
Outlook 2024
• Development of Nature-Positive Solutions 
Composite Index: A framework or set of indicators 
for land, soil, water (including water quality) and 
agrobiodiversity to measure and assess nature-
positive interventions. Socioeconomic indicators will 
also be included. 
• Launch of NATURE+ Integrated Farming Systems 
(IFS) model farms with research including farm-
level monitoring, data collection, and comparative 
assessments between farms. 
• Completion of the Diversity for Restoration web 
portal to include information on 237 assessed trees.
• Research on impact of restoration on ecosystems 
and livelihoods.
• Continued farmer training across work areas, 
including usage of digital solutions in tree-based 
restoration activities.
• Identification of key actors and groups for 
training and research for the Circular Bioeconomy 
Innovation Hub, with a focus on development of 
training materials and implementation of circular 
bioeconomy activities at research clusters.

RESTORE to date
NATURE+ completed a community-led planting drive on 
communal land, which included local species selected 
by the community. Some 35 hectares and 4,000 saplings 
were planted. NATURE+ built a priority species list of 
237 tree species ideal for restoration and full trait and 
suitability modeling was completed for 177.
RESTORE 2024
The 237 priority tree species will be fully added to the 
Diversity for Restoration tool, and forest restoration 
activities will continue in the clusters. NATURE+ 
and partners will complete a comparative study on 
biodiversity and ecosystem services under grazed and RECYCLE to date
A circular bio-economy innovation hub was launched 
with an accompanying website and the first meeting of 
the hub was conducted with new stakeholders in India. 
Agricultural and livestock waste was identified in micro-
watersheds to explore potential for circular bioeconomy 
activities. The Initiative conducted capacity building on 
agri-livestock waste management in local languages 
and farmers; 80 farmers were trained on management 
strategies.
RECYCLE 2024
The Initiative will continue the development of the 
circular bioeconomy innovation hub and develop a 
technical brief on the hub, along with a training manual 
for biogas. NATURE+ will continue the identification 
of potential stakeholders for the hub. In the selected 
sites, researchers will identify the gaps in the existing 
bioeconomy interventions and will help address these 
gaps through appropriate business models.
ENGAGE to date
NATURE+ collected cross-cutting data for all work 
packages and conducted 1,227 quantitative household 
surveys related to crop area, livestock, income source, 
food, energy, fuel and waste management, along with 
27 community surveys for land use and other services. 
Furthermore, qualitative data collection were collected 
using 20 key informant interviews and 20 focus group 
discussions with men and women farmers and results 
were reported to the NATURE+ Pause and Reflect 
meeting at the end of the year. Natural resource 
mapping for nature-positive solutions was completed.
ENGAGE 2024
The Initiative will complete a preliminary analysis of the 
survey data and a technical report on the quantitative 
results will be prepared. Qualitative results will be 
reported in a discussion paper and journal article 
focused on gender and nature-positive solutions. A 
journal article has been prepared based on mapping 
above-ground carbon storage and sequestration using 
the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and 
Tradeoffs model in a separate watershed that will have 
implications for the NATURE+ sites. CONSERVE and MANAGE 2024
NATURE+ model farms will be created using the 
integrated farming system approach at selected sites. 
The Initiative will develop a composite index to study 
nature-positive indicators for land, soil, water, and 
agrobiodiversity. Support for an existing seed bank in 
Akole cluster will continue, and a new seed bank will be 
developed. The Initiative will support the establishment 
of an on-farm conservation center for Rabi (or “winter” 
crops, which include wheat). Research trials will assess 
drought-tolerant microorganisms, biochar,   and  hydrogel 
impact on the growth and yield of gram (chickpea) under 
drought stress on research plots. The Initiative will do 
measurements of hydro-meteorological parameters 
and installation of equipment at clusters for climate-
smart watershed strategies. Furthermore, 50,000 cactus 
cladodes (cactus shoots) will be planted. CONSERVE and MANAGE to date
NATURE+ established 14 on-farm conservation centers 
focused on Kharif (“autumn”) crops, which include 
dozens of varieties ranging from staple cereals (corn 
and rice) to a plethora of fruits, vegetables, and 
legumes. The Initiative established community-level 
seed production and seed banks for many of these 
crops to reduce dependency on expensive seeds. To 
address water scarcity issues, NATURE+ identified 
and studied three micro-sheds per cluster for soil 
and water conservation research and interventions. 
Management trials on Kharif rice were completed for 
60 demonstration plots. A 100-hectare watershed was 
selected for the implementation of climate-smart and 
nature-positive watershed management strategies.Initiative activities include work on the conservation, 
management, and restoration of traditional and local 
plant species (through sustainable agricultural systems 
called WADIs that integrate agriculture, horticulture 
and forestry) for improved livelihoods and optimal 
use of local resources. Research training, capacity 
building, and assessment of interventions are also key 
to strengthening stakeholder engagement and capacity 
development, focused on nature-positive interventions. 
The Initiative has five work packages: CONSERVE, 
MANAGE, RESTORE, RECYCLE, and ENGAGE.

Report 2023 & Outlook 2024
In India, the CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive Solutions works in remote parts of 
Western India’s Maharashtra State. NATURE+ and its partners selected several sites 
(called clusters) for their high potential for implementing nature-positive activities to 
improve nutrition, climate resilience, food security and to conserve nature. People in 
these tribal areas also have rich traditional knowledge that is key to natural solutions. Nature-Positive Solutions Initiative Country Overview
Page 2:
What is NATURE+?
The CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive Solutions 
aims to re-imagine, collaboratively create and 
implement nature-positive solutions for agri-
food systems that equitably support food and 
livelihoods and ensure that agriculture is a net-
positive contributor to biodiversity and nature.
The challenges
There are several challenges to a nature-positive 
transition in India. There is limited local-level data on 
available resources and their utilization for nature-
positive land use. There is a general lack of awareness 
on the efficient use of resources. There is little to no 
market for sustainable circular economy business 
models. Financing for nature-based solutions at the 
individual or farm level remains low.
The NATURE+ approach
The Initiative works in collaboration with highly capable 
partner organizations that specialize in activities related 
to agricultural management and production. In addition, 
NATURE+ collaborates with relevant on-the-ground 
stakeholders to assess, develop, implement, and sustain 
nature-positive solutions in agri-food systems to ensure 
income generation, improve biodiversity, and deliver 
a net-positive impact of agriculture on nature. The 
Initiative creates opportunities to access the broader 
food basket through more nutrient-rich crop varieties to 
help develop more resilient and adaptable farming and 
seed systems. The opportunities
To provide strong institutional support in India for a 
transition to nature-based solutions, NATURE+ works to 
enhance income opportunities (particularly for women, 
youth and indigenous peoples) through value chains 
related to seeds, crops, fruit trees, waste, payment for 
ecosystem services, and public procurement. Improved 
restoration and soil management efforts, as well as 
improved recycling value chains, will create highly valued 
carbon sinks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Where NATURE+ works 
In India, the CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive 
Solutions   works in two clusters, Akole and Nandurbar, 
Maharashtra.
NATURE+ study areas in India (represented in terms of 
administrative boundaries).
Outlook 2024
• Development of Nature-Positive Solutions 
Composite Index: A framework or set of indicators 
for land, soil, water (including water quality) and 
agrobiodiversity to measure and assess nature-
positive interventions. Socioeconomic indicators will 
also be included. 
• Launch of NATURE+ Integrated Farming Systems 
(IFS) model farms with research including farm-
level monitoring, data collection, and comparative 
assessments between farms. 
• Completion of the Diversity for Restoration web 
portal to include information on 237 assessed trees.
• Research on impact of restoration on ecosystems 
and livelihoods.
• Continued farmer training across work areas,

 Executive summary  
Sustainable resource management and biodiversity conservation have become a priority in agricultural 
production. A cross -sectional survey was conducted on 174 households  who were members  of Diet Health 
Clubs ( DHCs) and Value Chain Groups ( VCGs ) using both quantitative and qualitative methods. 
Quantitative data w as collected using the Kobo Toolbox application and analyzed using Stata v15.2 
software, while qualitative info was  recorded in MS Word and analyzed using MS Excel.  
The results showed that the majority of the participants in DHCs and VCGs were female (86%) and former 
members of the NWO project (76.4%). Most of them (over 80%) had attended at least three training 
sessions in the previous time . Over 50% of households experienced land erosion, and the percentage of 
households with good soil quality was very low (upland: 14.5%, lowland: 27.9%, and home garden: 32%). 
On average, each household cultivated approximately 17 different  staple crops  and 10 vegetable ones 
and H'mo ng grew the fewest (14  and 10 respectively ). Households in Mai S on, H'mong, and DHCs grew 
vegetables for sale and applied nature positive solutions ( NPS) fewer than  those in Sa Pa, Dao/Th ai, and 
VCGs.  
Regarding production over the past three months, Mai Son, Thai, and VCG exhibited larger vegetable 
production areas compared to other groups. The majority of households cultivate vegetables in their 
home gardens (86%) and predominantly utilize indigenous vegetable v arieties (almost 78%). While the 
primary focus for farmers is self -consumption, 44% of households still engage in vegetable sales, with a 
concentration in the Dao and VCG groups. On average, each household cultivates nearly 10 types of 
vegetables, includin g three types of DGLV and four other types of vegetables. The Thai group tends to 
cultivate a higher number of DGLV types (4), and the Dao group cultivates more diverse types of other 
vegetables (5) compared to other groups. A majority of households (76%) rely on self -saved vegetable 
seeds for cultivation, but nearly 30% of households face challenges with seed germination. Approximately 
77% of vegetables are used similarly in the last season for sowing purposes in the upcoming plan (82.6%).  
On Nature Positive Solutions  (NPS), many households adopt practices such as nutritional arrangement, 
intercropping, and reducing/eliminating the use of chemical pesticides and disease prevention spraying 
(67.8%, 67.7%, 67.2%, 61.5%), particularly in Sa Pa (92.7%, 89%, 87.8%, 85.4%) a nd the Dao group (90.8%, 
90.8%, 90.8%, 90.8%). Meanwhile, Mai Son (96.7%) and the Thai group (94.8%) have the highest 
percentage of farmers using fertilizers.  
In terms of food consumption, the average diversity food group  score  among  ethnic households was 5, 
the NCD -Protect score was 3, and the NCD -Risk score was 2. Households in Sa Pa and among the H’mo ng 
and Dao ethnic groups had lower diversity and NCD -Protect scores than those of  other groups. 
Additionally, very few households (17%) consumed all five recommended food groups, with this 
percentage being particularly low in the Sa Pa, H'mong, and Dao groups. On the other hand, households 
in Mai S on, Thai , and DH Cs consumed vegetables  fewer  than the community average (73%), but these 
groups had a higher consumption of salty or fried snacks. Conversely, households in Sa Pa and the Dao 
group consumed more sweet foods.  Men played a central role in  decision on  agricultural production, 
purchasing asset, economic development loans, or income utilization.  
In-depth interviews with VCGs revealed that the Van Phuc cooperative had a larger scale and higher 
production costs for commercial vegetable cultivation compared to the Can Ho group, which primarily 
focused on seed production. Both groups faced challenges related to accessing high -quality seeds, harsh 
weather conditions, low prices, land degradation, seed wastage, weak marketing activities, and  limited 
management capacity.  Regarding seed us e, the Van Phuc cooperative relied on sources from companies 
Page 7:
 
 
vii 
 and markets, while the Can Ho group could produce their own seeds for future seasons. Both groups had 
production and marketing plans for their crops but encountered difficulties related to weather, prices, 
and access to input materials, leading to deviatio ns from their plans. Therefore, there is a need to enhance 
the capacity of DHC and VCG members in applying NPSs in production and consuming healthy food groups 
(vegetables, fruits, legumes). In addition, gender equality education for DHC members, expanding  nursery 
production scale, developing local vegetable brands, and strengthening the capacity of VCG management 
should also be prioritized.

 1. Introductio n 
The OneCGIAR  initiative on Nature -positive Solutions for Shifting Agrifood Systems to More Resilient and 
Sustainable Pathways (Nature+) aims to re -imagine, co -create, and implement nature -positive solutions -
based agrifood systems that equitably support food and liveli hoods on the ground, while simultaneously 
ensuring that agriculture is a net positive contributor to nature. Working with stakeholders across 
agriculture, economic, environment, and natural resource management sectors at farm - and community -
level, the init iative will work to meet food demands of growing populations by stewarding biodiversity 
and improving soil and water management with integrated nature -positive solutions. This will include  to 
i) Boost critical ecosystem services and enhance social and economic benefits, including equality. ii) Tackle 
the root economic and political causes of environmental degradation from agricultural production. iii) 
Harness the power of nature -based solution s and ecosystem services alongside advances in digital 
agricultur e and agronomy to reverse negative trends around natural assets, including climate, 
biodiversity, land, and water.  
WP2  will contribute to working with smallholder communities to ensure the sustainable, nature -positive 
management of biodiversity and other natural resources and improve production systems through 
nature -positive innovations, learning, and technologies. This w ill mainly be achieved through i) 
Participatory evaluation of the production and agrobiodiversity and capacity building of farmer groups in 
order to develop the farming systems towards sustainability and diversification and ii) Strengthen ing 
sustainable ve getable value chains to improve quality of produce and farmer household income . 
Understanding the use and potential of nature positive solution s is a possible  entry point for improving 
diversity, sustainability in both pro duction and consumption patterns.  The activities of WP2 in Vietnam 
build on the work by the NWO vegetable seed systems project  with seed/vegetable value chains  groups  
and the diet health clubs, which  align with Nature+. The strong focus on nutrition, market access, and 
women inclusion in the NWO project can be further strengthened, while paying more attention to 
(agro)biodiversity and environmentally friendly principles and practices .  
2. Survey objective s 
The baseline survey was a part of WP2  of Nature+ initiative in Vietnam . Specific objectives of the baseline 
were: 
- Identify  nature positive practice s among ethnic minority households  
- Examine crop diversity in production and dietary diversity in consumption  
3. Methodology  
3.1.  Study design  
This was a cross -sectional descriptive study, combined with qualitative research methods. The qualitative 
research component was conducted simultaneously with the quantitative component, to supplement 
information regarding the advantages and challenges rel ated to the organi zation  and marketing in the 
value chain groups . 
3.2.  Survey respondents and sites  
Quantit ative survey : All p articipants were ethnic household who are members of Diet Health Clubs ( DHCs ) 
and Value Chain Groups ( VCGs ) in Co Noi and Chieng Chan communes (Mai Son district, Son La province) 
and Ngu Chi Son commune (Sa Pa township, Lao Cai province).

 Qualitative s urvey : Management board of  directors of the 02 VCGs:  Van Phuc cooperative  in Co Noi 
commune (Mai Son district, Son La province) and Can Ho seed production group  in Ngu Chi Son commune 
(Sa Pa township, Lao Cai province).  
DHCs were  instituted  and centered around the core of the village women's union —a socio -political 
organization that represents the women's class. These entities play a constructive role in advancing the 
agricultural development process and the establishment of new rural areas. The objective of the DHCs 
was to provide a  platform for capacity building and knowledge and skill exchange on seeds, production, 
and nutrition to enhance utilization and demand  for groups of women at village level. On the other hand, 
VCG s comprise both female  and male farmers engaged in the cultivation and marketing of vegetables and 
vegetable seeds. In the context of the NWO project, VCG aims to augment business revenue derived from 
agricultural products.  
3.3. Survey sample size  
In terms of sample, the baseline survey was conducted with 174 members  from 3 ethnic groups: Thai , 
H’mong , and Dao . The sampled groups were  pre-selected for Nature+ WP2 activities. The detailed sample 
size collected is shown in the table 3.1 below

3.4. Data collection  
Data was collected in July 2023. For recruitment into the survey , FAVRI staff communicated with DHC s 
and VCG s leaders to inform them  about the purpose and interview plan in each village. A list of eligible 
respondents was developed based on the result of group identification (task 1 in WP2). The list included 
group member’s names, their gender, household’s headers, village,  and phone numbers.  
Enumerators  in two study sites were identified  and involved in a 1 day -training course including theory 
and pr actice, on how to administer  the quantitative and qualitative tools . ""The survey tools  were  tested 
in Lech village, C o Noi commune (Mai S on district), and Ta Van Mong village, M uong Hoa commune (Sa 
Pa town), two locations with similar settings to the target ones but not within the survey sites . After the 
pre-test, the questionnaire was linguistically adjusted for appropriateness and logical consistency across  
the questions.  
Page 10:
 
 
3 
 Enumerators reached  out to  the participants for interviews based on the prepared  list. They introduced 
the objectives and content of the survey and  obtained informed  consent before conducting the 
interviews . All quantitative data was collected through the Kobo Toolbox application that was installed on 
the tablets .  
Meanwhile, key-informant -interviews  with the management board of directors of the VCGs were 
conducted by two enumerators  using a semi -structured questionnaire on paper.  
3.5. Data analysis  
For quantitative data , once all data collection was completed , quantitative data  is converted to a Stata  
file for analysis. The analysis was conducted by a researcher of FAVRI  using Stata v15.2 software. T he data 
was fully analyzed to address the research questions/baseline survey objectives. Descriptive statistical 
results are presented in terms of frequencies, proportions, mean values, and standard deviations.  
For qualitative  data , information from the qualitative portion was transcribed and stored as Word files. 
The content of the KIIs was coded and  group ed based on themes, using Excel 201 9. Several important 
details of the subject were extracted to demonstrate the results of the s urvey . 
3.6.  Ethnical approval s/ permission  
The s urvey  obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Alliance of Bioversity 
International and CIAT  dated July 4, 202 3. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. All 
analyses and reported results were  aggregate d to prevent individual disclosure.  
4. Survey  Findings  
The quantitative survey was conducted on 174 members of DHCs (130) and VCGs (44) in three communes 
located in Mai Son district (92) and Sa Pa town (82). The number of members in each ethnic group was 
relatively similar across the three minority ethnic grou ps: Thai (58), H'mong (51), and Dao (65). In addition, 
two in -depth interviews were conducted with members of the management board of Van Phuc 
cooperative  (Mai Son district) and the Can Ho seed production group (Sa Pa town).

Regarding soil quality in upland areas, only about 15% of households considered it to be good, with higher 
proportions in Sa Pa (20.7%), the Dao group (20%), and VCGs (almost 23%).  Approximately 28% of 
households believed that the quality of lowland soil was good, with even higher percentages in Sa Pa 
(32.1%), the Dao group (32.8%), and VCGs (39.1%).  Around 32% of households rated the quality of soil in

"10856","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2).

 Executive summary  
Sustainable resource management and biodiversity conservation have become a priority in agricultural 
production. A cross -sectional survey was conducted on 174 households  who were members  of Diet Health 
Clubs ( DHCs) and Value Chain Groups ( VCGs ) using both quantitative and qualitative methods. 
Quantitative data w as collected using the Kobo Toolbox application and analyzed using Stata v15.2 
software, while qualitative info was  recorded in MS Word and analyzed using MS Excel.  
The results showed that the majority of the participants in DHCs and VCGs were female (86%) and former 
members of the NWO project (76.4%). Most of them (over 80%) had attended at least three training 
sessions in the previous time . Over 50% of households experienced land erosion, and the percentage of 
households with good soil quality was very low (upland: 14.5%, lowland: 27.9%, and home garden: 32%). 
On average, each household cultivated approximately 17 different  staple crops  and 10 vegetable ones 
and H'mo ng grew the fewest (14  and 10 respectively ). Households in Mai S on, H'mong, and DHCs grew 
vegetables for sale and applied nature positive solutions ( NPS) fewer than  those in Sa Pa, Dao/Th ai, and 
VCGs.  
Regarding production over the past three months, Mai Son, Thai, and VCG exhibited larger vegetable 
production areas compared to other groups. The majority of households cultivate vegetables in their 
home gardens (86%) and predominantly utilize indigenous vegetable v arieties (almost 78%). While the 
primary focus for farmers is self -consumption, 44% of households still engage in vegetable sales, with a 
concentration in the Dao and VCG groups. On average, each household cultivates nearly 10 types of 
vegetables, includin g three types of DGLV and four other types of vegetables. The Thai group tends to 
cultivate a higher number of DGLV types (4), and the Dao group cultivates more diverse types of other 
vegetables (5) compared to other groups. A majority of households (76%) rely on self -saved vegetable 
seeds for cultivation, but nearly 30% of households face challenges with seed germination. Approximately 
77% of vegetables are used similarly in the last season for sowing purposes in the upcoming plan (82.6%).  
On Nature Positive Solutions  (NPS), many households adopt practices such as nutritional arrangement, 
intercropping, and reducing/eliminating the use of chemical pesticides and disease prevention spraying 
(67.8%, 67.7%, 67.2%, 61.5%), particularly in Sa Pa (92.7%, 89%, 87.8%, 85.4%) a nd the Dao group (90.8%, 
90.8%, 90.8%, 90.8%). Meanwhile, Mai Son (96.7%) and the Thai group (94.8%) have the highest 
percentage of farmers using fertilizers.  
In terms of food consumption, the average diversity food group  score  among  ethnic households was 5, 
the NCD -Protect score was 3, and the NCD -Risk score was 2. Households in Sa Pa and among the H’mo ng 
and Dao ethnic groups had lower diversity and NCD -Protect scores than those of  other groups. 
Additionally, very few households (17%) consumed all five recommended food groups, with this 
percentage being particularly low in the Sa Pa, H'mong, and Dao groups. On the other hand, households 
in Mai S on, Thai , and DH Cs consumed vegetables  fewer  than the community average (73%), but these 
groups had a higher consumption of salty or fried snacks. Conversely, households in Sa Pa and the Dao 
group consumed more sweet foods.  Men played a central role in  decision on  agricultural production, 
purchasing asset, economic development loans, or income utilization.  
In-depth interviews with VCGs revealed that the Van Phuc cooperative had a larger scale and higher 
production costs for commercial vegetable cultivation compared to the Can Ho group, which primarily 
focused on seed production. Both groups faced challenges related to accessing high -quality seeds, harsh 
weather conditions, low prices, land degradation, seed wastage, weak marketing activities, and  limited 
management capacity.  Regarding seed us e, the Van Phuc cooperative relied on sources from companies 
Page 7:
 
 
vii 
 and markets, while the Can Ho group could produce their own seeds for future seasons. Both groups had 
production and marketing plans for their crops but encountered difficulties related to weather, prices, 
and access to input materials, leading to deviatio ns from their plans. Therefore, there is a need to enhance 
the capacity of DHC and VCG members in applying NPSs in production and consuming healthy food groups 
(vegetables, fruits, legumes). In addition, gender equality education for DHC members, expanding  nursery 
production scale, developing local vegetable brands, and strengthening the capacity of VCG management 
should also be prioritized.

 1. Introductio n 
The OneCGIAR  initiative on Nature -positive Solutions for Shifting Agrifood Systems to More Resilient and 
Sustainable Pathways (Nature+) aims to re -imagine, co -create, and implement nature -positive solutions -
based agrifood systems that equitably support food and liveli hoods on the ground, while simultaneously 
ensuring that agriculture is a net positive contributor to nature. Working with stakeholders across 
agriculture, economic, environment, and natural resource management sectors at farm - and community -
level, the init iative will work to meet food demands of growing populations by stewarding biodiversity 
and improving soil and water management with integrated nature -positive solutions. This will include  to 
i) Boost critical ecosystem services and enhance social and economic benefits, including equality. ii) Tackle 
the root economic and political causes of environmental degradation from agricultural production. iii) 
Harness the power of nature -based solution s and ecosystem services alongside advances in digital 
agricultur e and agronomy to reverse negative trends around natural assets, including climate, 
biodiversity, land, and water.  
WP2  will contribute to working with smallholder communities to ensure the sustainable, nature -positive 
management of biodiversity and other natural resources and improve production systems through 
nature -positive innovations, learning, and technologies. This w ill mainly be achieved through i) 
Participatory evaluation of the production and agrobiodiversity and capacity building of farmer groups in 
order to develop the farming systems towards sustainability and diversification and ii) Strengthen ing 
sustainable ve getable value chains to improve quality of produce and farmer household income . 
Understanding the use and potential of nature positive solution s is a possible  entry point for improving 
diversity, sustainability in both pro duction and consumption patterns.  The activities of WP2 in Vietnam 
build on the work by the NWO vegetable seed systems project  with seed/vegetable value chains  groups  
and the diet health clubs, which  align with Nature+. The strong focus on nutrition, market access, and 
women inclusion in the NWO project can be further strengthened, while paying more attention to 
(agro)biodiversity and environmentally friendly principles and practices .  
2. Survey objective s 
The baseline survey was a part of WP2  of Nature+ initiative in Vietnam . Specific objectives of the baseline 
were: 
- Identify  nature positive practice s among ethnic minority households  
- Examine crop diversity in production and dietary diversity in consumption  
3. Methodology  
3.1.  Study design  
This was a cross -sectional descriptive study, combined with qualitative research methods. The qualitative 
research component was conducted simultaneously with the quantitative component, to supplement 
information regarding the advantages and challenges rel ated to the organi zation  and marketing in the 
value chain groups . 
3.2.  Survey respondents and sites  
Quantit ative survey : All p articipants were ethnic household who are members of Diet Health Clubs ( DHCs ) 
and Value Chain Groups ( VCGs ) in Co Noi and Chieng Chan communes (Mai Son district, Son La province) 
and Ngu Chi Son commune (Sa Pa township, Lao Cai province).

 Qualitative s urvey : Management board of  directors of the 02 VCGs:  Van Phuc cooperative  in Co Noi 
commune (Mai Son district, Son La province) and Can Ho seed production group  in Ngu Chi Son commune 
(Sa Pa township, Lao Cai province).  
DHCs were  instituted  and centered around the core of the village women's union —a socio -political 
organization that represents the women's class. These entities play a constructive role in advancing the 
agricultural development process and the establishment of new rural areas. The objective of the DHCs 
was to provide a  platform for capacity building and knowledge and skill exchange on seeds, production, 
and nutrition to enhance utilization and demand  for groups of women at village level. On the other hand, 
VCG s comprise both female  and male farmers engaged in the cultivation and marketing of vegetables and 
vegetable seeds. In the context of the NWO project, VCG aims to augment business revenue derived from 
agricultural products.  
3.3. Survey sample size  
In terms of sample, the baseline survey was conducted with 174 members  from 3 ethnic groups: Thai , 
H’mong , and Dao . The sampled groups were  pre-selected for Nature+ WP2 activities. The detailed sample 
size collected is shown in the table 3.1 below

3.4. Data collection  
Data was collected in July 2023. For recruitment into the survey , FAVRI staff communicated with DHC s 
and VCG s leaders to inform them  about the purpose and interview plan in each village. A list of eligible 
respondents was developed based on the result of group identification (task 1 in WP2). The list included 
group member’s names, their gender, household’s headers, village,  and phone numbers.  
Enumerators  in two study sites were identified  and involved in a 1 day -training course including theory 
and pr actice, on how to administer  the quantitative and qualitative tools . ""The survey tools  were  tested 
in Lech village, C o Noi commune (Mai S on district), and Ta Van Mong village, M uong Hoa commune (Sa 
Pa town), two locations with similar settings to the target ones but not within the survey sites . After the 
pre-test, the questionnaire was linguistically adjusted for appropriateness and logical consistency across  
the questions.  
Page 10:
 
 
3 
 Enumerators reached  out to  the participants for interviews based on the prepared  list. They introduced 
the objectives and content of the survey and  obtained informed  consent before conducting the 
interviews . All quantitative data was collected through the Kobo Toolbox application that was installed on 
the tablets .  
Meanwhile, key-informant -interviews  with the management board of directors of the VCGs were 
conducted by two enumerators  using a semi -structured questionnaire on paper.  
3.5. Data analysis  
For quantitative data , once all data collection was completed , quantitative data  is converted to a Stata  
file for analysis. The analysis was conducted by a researcher of FAVRI  using Stata v15.2 software. T he data 
was fully analyzed to address the research questions/baseline survey objectives. Descriptive statistical 
results are presented in terms of frequencies, proportions, mean values, and standard deviations.  
For qualitative  data , information from the qualitative portion was transcribed and stored as Word files. 
The content of the KIIs was coded and  group ed based on themes, using Excel 201 9. Several important 
details of the subject were extracted to demonstrate the results of the s urvey . 
3.6.  Ethnical approval s/ permission  
The s urvey  obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Alliance of Bioversity 
International and CIAT  dated July 4, 202 3. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. All 
analyses and reported results were  aggregate d to prevent individual disclosure.  
4. Survey  Findings  
The quantitative survey was conducted on 174 members of DHCs (130) and VCGs (44) in three communes 
located in Mai Son district (92) and Sa Pa town (82). The number of members in each ethnic group was 
relatively similar across the three minority ethnic grou ps: Thai (58), H'mong (51), and Dao (65). In addition, 
two in -depth interviews were conducted with members of the management board of Van Phuc 
cooperative  (Mai Son district) and the Can Ho seed production group (Sa Pa town).

Background 
•The Mekong Delta is the ‘food basket’ of Vietnam, 
home to 18 million people producing food for more 
than 145 million people in Asia, and it is also one of 
the world’s most vulnerable regions to climate change 
and extreme weather events including sea-level rise, 
salinity intrusion, drought, and floods. 
•Alternative land use (e.g., the transition from rice to 
rice-shrimp/shrimp) or alternative labor use (e.g., 
off-farm activities and out-migration) are among the 
climate adaptation strategies 
Page 3:
Background 
•The transition between rice and shrimp needs to be 
implemented at community level, and decision is 
usually made based on majority. 
•Conflicts over natural resources may emerge as part of 
these transitions (e.g., rice vs shrimp farmers) 
•Literature have shown that inequality, fear and 
competition for resources can lead to conflict 
=> The study use lab-in-the-field experiment to explore 
farmer’s conflict and cooperation behaviors related to 
land use transition 
Page 4:
Research questions 
•How do farmer’s lack of decision-making power affect their conflict and cooperation 
behaviors? 
•How do farmer’s opportunity cost affect their conflict and cooperation behaviors? 
Page 5:
Conceptual Framework 
•According to Fehr and Schmidt (1990), inequality 
negatively affects utility (Equation 1) 
•We adapted the theory by: 
- Step 1: Adding Agency A: decision-making power can 
play a role (Equation 2) 
- Step 2: Adding Potential payoff X: opportunity cost can 
be an important factor as well (Equation 3) adding Agency (A) 
adding Opportunity cost (X) 
Page 6:
Hypotheses 
•H1: Farmers without agency (decision-making power) are more likely to behave spitefully and 
less likely to cooperate  
•H2: Farmers facing higher opportunity cost are more likely to behave spitefully and less likely to 
cooperate

Good at Rice, Good at Rice. Very Good types face higher 
opportunity cost in the first game.

Conclusions and implications 
•The result suggests that farmers without decision-making 
power (no agency) are more likely to exhibit spiteful behaviors 
•The effect is stronger and more signiﬁcant for farmers with 
higher opportunity costs, who faced larger trade-off in the ﬁrst 
game.
•The effect of having no agency is not very signiﬁcant for 
cooperation behaviors (because of high cooperation in all 
groups) 
Page 14:
Conclusions and implications 
•Lab-in-the-ﬁeld experiments can help gain insights into the 
attitudes and behaviors of farmers 
•Land use planning for climate adaptation need to involve 
empowering farmers to make informed decisions about their 
land use practices 
•Policymakers should aim for equitable resource allocation in 
adaptation policies to minimize the perceived opportunity 
costs. This can include ensuring fair access to resources like 
land, water, or ﬁnancial support for all affected parties, thereby 
reducing conﬂicts over resource scarcity.

Conclusions and implications 
•The result suggests that farmers without decision-making 
power (no agency) are more likely to exhibit spiteful behaviors 
•The effect is stronger and more signiﬁcant for farmers with 
higher opportunity costs, who faced larger trade-off in the ﬁrst 
game.
•The effect of having no agency is not very signiﬁcant for 
cooperation behaviors (because of high cooperation in all 
groups) 
Page 14:
Conclusions and implications 
•Lab-in-the-ﬁeld experiments can help gain insights into the 
attitudes and behaviors of farmers 
•Land use planning for climate adaptation need to involve 
empowering farmers to make informed decisions about their 
land use practices 
•Policymakers should aim for equitable resource allocation in 
adaptation policies to minimize the perceived opportunity 
costs. This can include ensuring fair access to resources like 
land, water, or ﬁnancial support for all affected parties, thereby 
reducing conﬂicts over resource scarcity.

Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2).

TAFSSA’s district agrifood systems assessment aimed to interview three respondents per household: a female 
adult (aged 20+ years), a male adult (aged 20+ years), and an adolescent (aged 10 -19 years). Information on the 
household and respondent sampling strategy is provided at the end of this data note. 
In this data note, you will first find information on background characteristics of the households and individuals 
who were interviewed. This is followed by information on what  people are eating, which was captured using 
several measurement methods. Respondents were asked about the foods they ate the day before the interview 
(24-hour recall) and about how often they ate certain foods in the past week (food frequency questionnaire). 
The 24 -hour recall was conducted using the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) application, which also captured 
when (at what eating occasion such as breakfast, a snack between lunch and dinner, etc.) people ate each food 
item. 
In addition to what people eat, you will find information in this data note on where  they get their food and, if 
they buy it, what types of markets or shops they buy it from. 
Finally, you will learn why  people choose to eat certain healthy and unhealthy foods. Respondents were asked 
about availability, accessibility, taste, and other factors that may influence their decisions to consume certain 
foods. More details about the measurement methods are found on the following pages.

Fig 3A. Level of household food insecurityFig 3B. Individual FIES items Measuring household food insecurity
Household food insecurity was measured 
using the Food and Agriculture Organization’s 
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). 
Respondents were asked 8 questions about 
their household’s experiences with food in the 
past 30 days. Categories of food security 
(none, mild, moderate, severe) were 
generated based on the number of questions 
with a positive response.

Diet quality scores
Fig 4A. Minimum dietary diversity MEASURING WHAT PEOPLE EAT
Diets were measured by asking people about 
everything they ate or drank on the previous day, 
from the time they woke up until the time they went 
to bed and didn’t eat or drink anything more. This 
includes all snacks and foods and drinks consumed at 
home and outside the home. 
To capture this information, we used the Global Diet 
Quality Score (GDQS) application ( Bromage  et al. 
2021). The GDQS allows us to understand diet quality, 
which is associated with the risk of disease. We report 
the percentage of individuals with at least minimum 
dietary diversity (FAO and FHI 360, 2016) ( Figure 4A ), 
that is those who consume at least 5 of the following 
10 food groups daily: 1) grains, white roots and tubers, 
and plantains, 2) pulses (beans, peas, and lentils), 3) 
nuts and seeds, 4) dairy, 5) meat, poultry, and fish, 6) 
eggs, 7) dark green leafy vegetables, 8) other vitamin 
A-rich fruits and vegetables, 9) other vegetables, and 
10) other fruits. 
We also computed metrics that indicate how healthy 
or unhealthy diets are ( Figure 4B ). Higher GDQS - and 
GDQS+ scores indicate better diet quality. We then 
grouped GDQS scores into 3 categories to indicate 
diet related noncommunicable disease risk ( Figure 
4C).
On the  following pages, we show the percentage of 
individuals who consume various food groups ( Figure 
5), the consumption quantity by food group ( Figure 
6), the most commonly consumed foods ( Figure 7 ), 
how many times per day people eat ( Figure 8 ), who 
eats at various eating occasions ( Figure 9 ).31%

Asia, and the Americas ( Bromage  et al. 2021). Disease risk is minimized when healthy foods are consumed in “high” quantities 
and unhealthy foods are consumed in “low” quantities.
Healthy Unhealthy 
FINDINGS
✓Few individuals consumed “high” quantities of healthy foods except liquid oils; in contrast, few 
individuals consumed “low/none” quantities of unhealthy foods.
✓To reduce the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases, consumption of healthy foods such as 
fruits and whole grains should increase and consumption of unhealthy foods such as refined 
grains/baked goods, sweets & ice -cream, and white roots & tubers should decrease.0% 50% 100%Medium

SENTINEL FOODS | In addition to the 
GDQS, which provided information about all foods 
consumed in the previous 24 hours, we selected a set 
of 25 “sentinel foods” to better understand how 
frequently these foods are consumed, food sources, 
where people buy food, and their perceptions about 
food. 
Respondents were asked how frequently they 
consumed these foods in the past 7 days ( Figure 10 ). 
They were also asked about where their household 
gets each food (purchased from outside, own 
production, received from others, received from 
government, gather/forage) ( Figure 11 ). If they said 
their household purchases the food, we asked them 
where it is purchased ( haat , retail shop, farm, 
government ration shop, or other market type) 
(Figure 12 ).
For a few foods, we dug deeper to understand 
people’s food perceptions, or what they think about 
the foods. This included whether they know of a 
vendor who sells the food, if the food is safe to eat, 
easy to acquire near where they spend most of their 
time, is not too expensive, is fast and easy to prepare, 
tastes good, fills their stomach, is nutritious, and if 
their family enjoys eating it ( Figure 13 ). 
Understanding these perceptions provides insights 
into drivers or barriers of consumption of healthy and 
unhealthy foods. Sentinel food list

KEY TAKEAWAYS
1. There is room for improvement in diet quality.
• Consumption of healthy food groups such as whole grains, nuts & seeds, animal -source foods, fruits, 
and deep orange vegetables is low.
• Consumption of  unhealthy food groups such as refined grains/baked goods, biscuits, sweets, and 
sugary tea/coffee is high. 
• Consumption of starchy foods with low nutrient density (rice, potatoes) is high.
• Compared to adults, adolescents are more likely to be at “high” diet related NCD risk.
2. Most households purchase food from markets rather than producing it themselves, though many 
households produce rice.
3. Food purchases are typically from haats , followed by retail shops.
KEY QUESTIONS FOR ACTION
1. What are the key barriers to improving diet quality in the district? 
2. What are a few potential solutions to overcome these barriers? What is needed from decision -makers 
and from program teams to implement these solutions? 
3. How can understanding eating patterns throughout the day and perceptions about healthy and 
unhealthy foods help inform strategies to influence consumption of these foods?
4. What additional information is needed to facilitate actions to improve diets in the district?

SURVEY METHODOLOGY
Village and household sampling
We selected 25 villages in the district with a probability proportional to the number of households that reside in 
each village. Within each village, we conducted a household listing to identify eligible households, that is, those 
with adolescents (10 -19 years old). From the households with adolescents, we randomly invited 20 households to 
participate in the survey. If a household refused, we replaced that household with another randomly selected 
eligible  household, to retain a total of 1,000 households in the district. Thus, the findings reported in this data 
note are representative of rural households from this district that include an adolescent.
Respondent selection
Within households, one adult female aged 20+ years, one adult male aged 20+ years, and one adolescent aged 
10-19 years were selected as the respondents for the survey. When multiple adolescents were living in a 
household, the oldest adolescent was selected. In some households, an adult male was not available (often due 
to migration for work). In such households, the female was the only adult respondent (see Table 1 for 
respondent sample sizes). At the beginning of the interview, the adult in the household primarily involved in 
agriculture (either male or female) and the adult primarily responsible for food purchasing (either male or 
female) were identified as the primary respondents. 
INDICATOR DEFINITIONS
Indicator Definition
GDQS+ The Global Diet Quality Score positive sub -metric is composed of the summed score of the 16 
healthy food groups and ranges from 0 -32 points, with a higher score indicating higher diet 
quality.
GDQS - The Global Diet Quality Score negative sub -metric is composed of the summed score of the 
7 unhealthy food groups and the 2 food groups that are unhealthy when consumed in 
excess amounts (high -fat dairy and red meat), with a higher score indicating lower diet 
quality. The GDQS negative score has a possible range of 0 -17.

- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

TAFSSA’s district agrifood systems assessment aimed to interview three respondents per household: a female 
adult (aged 20+ years), a male adult (aged 20+ years), and an adolescent (aged 10 -19 years). Information on the 
household and respondent sampling strategy is provided at the end of this data note. 
In this data note, you will first find information on background characteristics of the households and individuals 
who were interviewed. This is followed by information on what  people are eating, which was captured using 
several measurement methods. Respondents were asked about the foods they ate the day before the interview 
(24-hour recall) and about how often they ate certain foods in the past week (food frequency questionnaire). 
The 24 -hour recall was conducted using the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) application, which also captured 
when (at what eating occasion such as breakfast, a snack between lunch and dinner, etc.) people ate each food 
item. 
In addition to what people eat, you will find information in this data note on where  they get their food and, if 
they buy it, what types of markets or shops they buy it from. 
Finally, you will learn why  people choose to eat certain healthy and unhealthy foods. Respondents were asked 
about availability, accessibility, taste, and other factors that may influence their decisions to consume certain 
foods. More details about the measurement methods are found on the following pages.

Diet quality scores
Fig 4A. Minimum dietary diversity MEASURING WHAT PEOPLE EAT
Diets were measured by asking people about 
everything they ate or drank on the previous day, 
from the time they woke up until the time they went 
to bed and didn’t eat or drink anything more. This 
includes all snacks and foods and drinks consumed at 
home and outside the home. 
To capture this information, we used the Global Diet 
Quality Score (GDQS) application ( Bromage  et al. 
2021). The GDQS allows us to understand diet quality, 
which is associated with the risk of disease. We report 
the percentage of individuals with at least minimum 
dietary diversity (FAO and FHI 360, 2016) ( Figure 4A ), 
that is those who consume at least 5 of the following 
10 food groups daily: 1) grains, white roots and tubers, 
and plantains, 2) pulses (beans, peas, and lentils), 3) 
nuts and seeds, 4) dairy, 5) meat, poultry, and fish, 6) 
eggs, 7) dark green leafy vegetables, 8) other vitamin 
A-rich fruits and vegetables, 9) other vegetables, and 
10) other fruits. 
We also computed metrics that indicate how healthy 
or unhealthy diets are ( Figure 4B ). Higher GDQS - and 
GDQS+ scores indicate better diet quality. We then 
grouped GDQS scores into 3 categories to indicate 
diet related noncommunicable disease risk ( Figure 
4C).
On the  following pages, we show the percentage of 
individuals who consume various food groups ( Figure 
5), the consumption quantity by food group ( Figure 
6), the most commonly consumed foods ( Figure 7 ), 
how many times per day people eat ( Figure 8 ), who 
eats at various eating occasions ( Figure 9 ).31%

FINDINGS
✓Few individuals consumed “high” quantities of healthy foods except liquid oils; in contrast, few 
individuals consumed “low/none” quantities of unhealthy foods.
✓To reduce the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases, consumption of healthy foods such as 
fruits and whole grains should increase and consumption of unhealthy foods such as refined 
grains/baked goods, sweets & ice -cream, and white roots & tubers should decrease.0% 50% 100%Medium

SENTINEL FOODS | In addition to the 
GDQS, which provided information about all foods 
consumed in the previous 24 hours, we selected a set 
of 25 “sentinel foods” to better understand how 
frequently these foods are consumed, food sources, 
where people buy food, and their perceptions about 
food. 
Respondents were asked how frequently they 
consumed these foods in the past 7 days ( Figure 10 ). 
They were also asked about where their household 
gets each food (purchased from outside, own 
production, received from others, received from 
government, gather/forage) ( Figure 11 ). If they said 
their household purchases the food, we asked them 
where it is purchased ( haat , retail shop, farm, 
government ration shop, or other market type) 
(Figure 12 ).
For a few foods, we dug deeper to understand 
people’s food perceptions, or what they think about 
the foods. This included whether they know of a 
vendor who sells the food, if the food is safe to eat, 
easy to acquire near where they spend most of their 
time, is not too expensive, is fast and easy to prepare, 
tastes good, fills their stomach, is nutritious, and if 
their family enjoys eating it ( Figure 13 ). 
Understanding these perceptions provides insights 
into drivers or barriers of consumption of healthy and 
unhealthy foods. Sentinel food list

KEY TAKEAWAYS
1. There is room for improvement in diet quality.
• Consumption of healthy food groups such as whole grains, nuts & seeds, animal -source foods, fruits, 
and deep orange vegetables is low.
• Consumption of  unhealthy food groups such as refined grains/baked goods, biscuits, sweets, and 
sugary tea/coffee is high. 
• Consumption of starchy foods with low nutrient density (rice, potatoes) is high.
• Compared to adults, adolescents are more likely to be at “high” diet related NCD risk.
2. Most households purchase food from markets rather than producing it themselves, though many 
households produce rice.
3. Food purchases are typically from haats , followed by retail shops.
KEY QUESTIONS FOR ACTION
1. What are the key barriers to improving diet quality in the district? 
2. What are a few potential solutions to overcome these barriers? What is needed from decision -makers 
and from program teams to implement these solutions? 
3. How can understanding eating patterns throughout the day and perceptions about healthy and 
unhealthy foods help inform strategies to influence consumption of these foods?
4. What additional information is needed to facilitate actions to improve diets in the district?

SURVEY METHODOLOGY
Village and household sampling
We selected 25 villages in the district with a probability proportional to the number of households that reside in 
each village. Within each village, we conducted a household listing to identify eligible households, that is, those 
with adolescents (10 -19 years old). From the households with adolescents, we randomly invited 20 households to 
participate in the survey. If a household refused, we replaced that household with another randomly selected 
eligible  household, to retain a total of 1,000 households in the district. Thus, the findings reported in this data 
note are representative of rural households from this district that include an adolescent.
Respondent selection
Within households, one adult female aged 20+ years, one adult male aged 20+ years, and one adolescent aged 
10-19 years were selected as the respondents for the survey. When multiple adolescents were living in a 
household, the oldest adolescent was selected. In some households, an adult male was not available (often due 
to migration for work). In such households, the female was the only adult respondent (see Table 1 for 
respondent sample sizes). At the beginning of the interview, the adult in the household primarily involved in 
agriculture (either male or female) and the adult primarily responsible for food purchasing (either male or 
female) were identified as the primary respondents. 
INDICATOR DEFINITIONS
Indicator Definition
GDQS+ The Global Diet Quality Score positive sub -metric is composed of the summed score of the 16 
healthy food groups and ranges from 0 -32 points, with a higher score indicating higher diet 
quality.
GDQS - The Global Diet Quality Score negative sub -metric is composed of the summed score of the 
7 unhealthy food groups and the 2 food groups that are unhealthy when consumed in 
excess amounts (high -fat dairy and red meat), with a higher score indicating lower diet 
quality. The GDQS negative score has a possible range of 0 -17.

Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

"11100","ENVIRONMENTAL_HEALTH_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health and biodiversity. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to address global environmental challenges, including the protection of environmental health and the preservation of biodiversity. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign an environmental health and biodiversity impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for environmental health or biodiversity.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering environmental impacts.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research contributes meaningfully to environmental health or biodiversity, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems, indirectly supporting biodiversity conservation.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in environmental health or biodiversity.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing deforestation and maintaining genetic diversity in agricultural systems.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Water Use:** Limiting consumptive water use in food production to less than 2,500 km³ per year, particularly in stressed basins.
- **Deforestation:** Achieving zero net deforestation.
- **Nitrogen Application:** Managing nitrogen application to 90 Tg per year with a focus on low-input farming systems and increased efficiency.
- **Phosphorus Application:** Managing phosphorus application to 10 Tg per year.
- **Genetic Diversity:** Maintaining the genetic diversity of seed varieties, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals, including their wild relatives.
- **Conservation and Restoration:** Promoting water conservation, soil restoration, biodiversity restoration in situ, and managing pollution related to food systems.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “deforestation,” “biodiversity,” or “conservation.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in environmental health and biodiversity.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health or biodiversity, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If environmental health or biodiversity are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that environmental health or biodiversity objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign an environmental health and biodiversity tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**

This Inclusive Landscape Management Plan (ILMP) seeks to provide a framework for the sustainable management and development of landscapes in the Ahafo Ano Southwest District (AASWD) of Ghana. The ILMP is designed to address the increasing pressure on landscapes in West and Central Africa under TAFS-WCA initiative (from deforestation, land degradation, poor water management, unsustainable mining, wildlife poaching, and climate change). The ILMP emphasizes the integration of social and ecological systems, local participation, and sustainable resource use and management within landscapes. It is a response to ‘top-down’ approaches to sustainable development, in which power and decision-making are in the hands of external development professionals. Instead, the ILMP is based on shared ownership of decision-making and the full participation of all stakeholders.
This ILMP is a product of a collaborative effort between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the AASWD, and local stakeholders from the Mankran micro-watershed of Ghana. The ILMP was developed through a participatory process that involved stakeholders from all sectors, including government, civil society, and the private sector. The process began with the creation of a narrative that served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management in the Mankran microwatershed. The research team then worked with local stakeholders to assess the current state of the landscape and identify key challenges and opportunities. Based on the assessment, the research team and stakeholders co-developed a set of management strategies and interventions that are designed to address the key challenges and achieve the desired outcomes. The ILMP was designed with a shared vision for the landscape: “To sustainably co-harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable manner to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano Southwest District. Based on the vision and identified challenges, stakeholders proposed various response strategies that included: Increased irrigation efficiency through adaptive and inclusive management; mechanisms to reduce postharvest losses; mechanism for profit or benefit sharing from mining and forestry; Enhanced gender and youth involvement in decision-making; Improved income and livelihood diversification opportunities; Improved adoption of sustainable land/forest/water management practices; Increased food safety through reduced contamination from pesticides and galamsey (illegal small-scale mining) the strengthening of local/traditional institutions for natural resources management. The ILMP also includes a monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress and ensure that the interventions are having the desired impact. It is critical to note that the ILMP is a living document that should be updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in the landscape and the needs of the stakeholders. It is hoped that the ILMP would serve as a blueprint for sustainable and inclusive landscape management in the AASWD and beyond.

 Summary  
Inclusive landscape management (ILM) is a holistic approach to managing landscapes that considers  the 
needs of all stakeholders, including local communities, indigenous peoples, and marginalized groups. This 
Inclusive Landscape Management Plan (ILMP) seeks to provide a framework for the sustainable 
management and development of landscapes in the Ahafo  Ano Southwest District (AASWD) of Ghana. 
The ILMP is designed to address the increasing pressure on landscapes in West and Central Africa under 
TAFS -WCA initiative (from deforestation, land degradation, poor water management, unsustainable 
mining, wildlif e poaching, and climate change). The ILMP emphasizes the integration of social and 
ecological systems, local participation, and sustainable resource use and management within landscapes. 
It is a response to ‘top -down’ approaches to sustainable development,  in which power and decision -making 
are in the hands of external development professionals. Instead, the ILMP is based on shared ownership 
of decision -making and the full participation of all stakeholders.  
This ILMP is a product of a collaborative effort between the International Water Management Institute 
(IWMI), the AASWD, and local stakeholders from the Mankran micro -watershed of Ghana. The ILMP 
was developed through a participatory process that involved stakeholders from all sectors, including 
government, civil society, and the private sector. The process began with the creation of a narrative that 
served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management in the Mankran micro -
watershed. The research team then worked with local stakeholders to assess the current state of the 
landscape and identify key challenges and opportunities.   Based on the assessment, the research team and 
stakeholders co -developed a set of management strategies and interventions that are designed to address 
the key challenges and achieve the desired outcomes. The ILMP was designed with a shared vision for the 
landscape : “To sustainably co -harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable manner 
to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano Southwest  District . Based 
on the vision and identified challenges, stakeholders proposed various  response strategies  that included : 
Increase d irrigation efficiency through adaptive and inclusive management ; mechanisms to reduce 
postharvest losses ; mechanism for profit or benefit sharing from mining and forestry ; Enhance d gender 
and youth  involvement  in decision -making ; Improve d income and livelihood diversification opportunities;  
Improve d adoption of sustainable land/forest/water management practices ; Increase d food safety  through 
reduce d contamination from pesticides and galamsey (illegal small -scale mining ) the strengthening of 
local/traditional institutions for natural resources management.  The ILMP also includes a monitoring and 
evaluation framework to track progress and ensure that the interventions are having the desired impact. It 
is critical to note that t he ILMP is a living document that should  be updated on a regular basis to reflect 
changes in the landscape and the needs of the stakeholders. It is hoped that the ILMP w ould serve as a 
blueprint for sustainable and inclusive landscape management in the  AASWD  and beyond.

 1.0 Introduction  
Landscape management in West and Central Africa faces increasing pressure from deforestation, land 
degradation, poor water management, unsustainable mining, wildlife poaching, and climate change. The 
upsurge in unsustainable land use practices has resulted in ongoing environmental degradation , with 
implication s for the growing demand for food in terms of both quantity and quality, competition for 
productive land, urban expansion, demand for forest resources, demand for water resources, wildfires, soil 
health (indicated by lower nutrient status and organic content), fores t ecosystems, and water resources. 
Coupled with the mounting impacts o f anthropogenic climate change, this trend is projected to exacerbate 
exposure and vulnerability of production and livelihoods in this agrifood system, threatening its resilience.  
 
The above context justifies the urgent need for a sustainable and inclusive approach to landscape 
management. Inclusive landscape management plans (ILMP) emphasize the integration of social and 
ecological systems, local participation, and sustainable resou rce use and management within landscapes 
(Albert et al. 2014). The approach focuses on ensuring the inclusivity of decision -making processes, 
valuing diverse perspectives, and addressing power imbalances among stakeholders . The inclusive 
approach is based on shared ownership of decision -making. It is a response to ‘top -down’ approaches to 
sustainable development, in which power and decision -making is in the hands of external development 
professionals. Participation is key in advancing sustainable developmen t and considering the social 
context. Sustainable development allows for the improvement of everyone's quality of life while preserving 
and developing the natural resources on which life depends. Because problems involving unsustainable 
resource use are of ten complex and frequently need compromises and trade -offs, processes that involve 
full participation from all stakeholders typically yield the best and most lasting results. Consequently, 
success stories of inclusive landscape management depict large -scale initiatives co mprising stakeholders 
implementing coordinated interventions across a variety of land uses for a desired effect and impact.  
 
This ILMP seeks to provide a framework for the inclusive participation of stakeholders in the sustainable 
management and development of landscape s in the Ahafo Ano Southwest  District (AASWD) for socio -
economic and environmental benefits  (See Figure 1 for map of AASWD) . By prioritizing inclusivity, this 
landscape management plan aims to create a more harmonious and sustainable relationship between 
communities, ecosystems, and development, fostering resilience and equitable benefits for all. This 
strategic plan defines a broader shared vision, objectives , and a road map that would aid all stakeholders 
and institutions to contribute to the effective and sustainable management of natural resources in the 
AASWD. This would also guide the AASWD to prepare their own investment action plans towards 
achieving the overall vision. The landscape management strategy would also provide a strategic framework 
that Medium Term Development Plans  (MTDPs) of the district could link up to achieve their climate 
change and environmental/natural resources management obligations as provided by the National 
Development Planning Commission Guidelines for the preparation of MTDP.  There is also the Ghana 
Cocoa Forest REDD+  Programme (GCFRP) , which represents an innovative, unique, and highly ambitious 
programme  to reduce deforestation  and degradation in a sub -national landscape of approximately 5.9 
million ha  in Ghana.  Given that the AASWD landscape falls within the area earmarked for the 
implementation of this programme , this ILMP  also explores opportunities for building synergies and 
model s the target  landscape around the Hotspot Intervention Area (HIA) concept to benefit from the 
programme. The shared land scape vision and the elements of th is ILMP are also in line with Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) , which are the global blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future 
for all.

2.0 Methodology  
The IL MP for AASWD prescribe s an inclusive, action -oriented , and collaborative process targeted at 
delivering on the aspiration of stakeholders towards a future of social and economic progress under a 
robust natural resource management system. These principles also reflect  in the Medium -Term  
Development Plans (MTDPs) of the AASWD , Ghana’s Land degradation Neutrality  (LDN)  targets , and 
national  sustainable development priorities and targets. The key elements of this ILMP  include:  
• Shared or agreed management objectives that encompass multiple benefits from the landscape  
• Field, farm , and forest practices designed to contribute to multiple objectives, including human 
well-being, food production, climate change mitigation, and conservation of biodiversity and 
ecosystem services . 
• Ecological, social, and economic interactions among various  parts of the landscape are managed 
to realize positive synergies among interests and actors or to mitigate negative trade -offs 
• Collaborative, community -engaged processes for dialogue, planning, negotiating and monitoring 
decisions are in place . 
• Markets and public policies are contextualized  to achieve the diverse set of landscape objectives 
and institutional requirements . 
The ILMP  development  followed  the iterative  and non-linear  inclusive  planning  framework  (See Tilahun  
et al. 2023;  Atampugre  et al. 2023)  that involves  the following  key components  (See Figure  2 for a 
simplified  illustration ):  
• Definition  of goals  and objectives . 
Page 9:
 9 
 • Stakeholders  mapping  and identification  of key challenges  and demand  driven  intervention  
practices . 
• Conduct  workshops  and iterative  planning  to co-design  options  of landscape  management  plans,  
• Assessment  of and recommendations  for gender  equality  and social  inclusion  (GESI) .

Step 1: Narrative development  
The initial step of co -developing the Inclusive Landscape Management Plan (ILMP) was to create a 
narrative that served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management to enhance the 
current landscape state. A research team from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) 
together with identified regional and local stakeholder s evaluated the social ecological sustainability of the 
social ecological landscape and envisioned future strategies. To initiate this process, a suitable micro -
watershed for action was identified and this involved local stakeholders in areas facing socio -ecological 
challenges. This local involvement was essential for addressing issues related to land and water resource 
management, aiming to improve food security, income, and nutrition. The AASWD played a crucial role 
in integrating these efforts into their  plans, so their involvement in this first step was fundamental. Key 
stakeholders collaborated to define a target landscape that aligns with the narrative's goals. Accordingly, 
a micro -watershed in the Mankran watershed was co -identified  (Figure 3) .

Step 2: Resource unit assessment  
Once the Mankran micro -watershed was identified, the next step was to map competing resource units and 
establish local expert groups to represent these resource systems. The research team guided the local 
experts in co -creating inventories of critical elem ents related to land use and ecosystem services within the 
landscape. They also co -identified site -specific indicators for landscape situational analysis ( See 
Atampugre et al. 2022 a) and the assessments of future landscape performance. Citizen scientists w ere 
employed to conduct hydrological and water quality assessments different land use categories , i.e., f orest, 
agriculture,  and degraded  areas  (See Figure 4).

Step 3: Co -design , visualization , and documentation of ILMP  
The third step of the process was to develop a mid -term ILMP for the AASWD. This involved three 
workshops with the regional and community expert groups  (involving 67 participants , See Figure 5), 
focusing on  landscape challenges and vision, with emphasis on  management strategies, resource 
allocation, assigning responsibilities, and financial considerations. The workshops began with a briefing 
on the current landscape challenges  in plenary . The FGDs were organised based on gender to ensure equal 
participation and promote freedom of expression (considering the cultural setup in communities). I ssues

 related to GESI were duly considered to  enhance inclusivity.  Resource users and other stakeholders then 
co-defined a common landscape vision and specific objectives with associated strategies. The final plan 
was generated by integrating various stakeholders' perspectives  (Appendix  A and B  for detailed workshop 
plan).

Considering that this is a living ILMP, there will several follow -up activities involving piloting and testing 
of certain  technology  and innovation bundles  that were identified during the co -design phase (Step 3) . As 
part of this will be an  extensive co -validation process to evaluate the suitability and efficacy of the 
strategies . There will also be activities related to impact evaluation of ILMP interventions using the SI 
framework to measure improvements in social -ecological landscape objectives /goals . This is to facilitate 
ongoing learning and communication among stakeholders involved in landscape management.  It is also 
expected that there will be an effort to scaling out ILMP  process and its interventions  to Greater Ahafo 
Ano area . The goal is to create an inclusive and sustainable development plan that ensures the ongoing 
maintenance of landscapes and provides guidance for accommodating recent  changes driven by social, 
economic, and environmental processes. The scaling out strategies include , but not limited to, the 
following  key elements:  
• Involving Local Government: Engaging the local government as a facilitator right from the 
beginning of the process.  
• Continuous Stakeholder Engagement: Maintaining ongoing engagement with key stakeholders.  
• Presentation at Local and National Levels: Sharing the co -design process at both local and national 
levels to gain broader support.  
To scale any intervention bundles from the plan, various existing approaches may be  used:  participatory 
innovation platforms, adaptive scaling strategi es, multi -sectoral platforms, and  food system accelerator 
challenge. These strate gies must be  tailored to specific intervention s being scaled to ensure their successful 
integration into the broader  productive  landscape.

 3.0 Landscape Situational Analysis  in Ahafo Ano Southwest  District  
Using the DPSIR -SEL framework  (See Atampugre et al. 2022 b), a mix of methods, and the micro -
watershed in the Mankran watershed in the Ahafo Ano Southwest  District (AASWD) as a case, the 
research team conducted landscap e situational analysis (LSA) . The LSA aimed at giving an overview of 
how drivers and pressures combine to delineate the Social Ecological Landscape (SEL) state and impacts, 
highlighting the institutional responses. The driving forces behind the pressures that define the state of and 
impacts on the landscape are local, albeit a few national and global  drivers (Figure 6 for a summary of the 
LSA findings). The LSA showed that unregulated small -scale mining, large -scale wood exploitation, and 
the conversion of forest ecosystems into farms and plantations are growing threats to the health and 
function of the landscape (Figure 5). These activities are driven by  poverty, limited livelihood alternatives, 
and high demand for ecological resources. The impacts of these activities include food insecurity, 
biodiversity loss, livelihood destruction, and ecosystem de gradation.  The research found that human 
activities are destroying the landscape and livelihoods, and this is leading to poverty, food insecurity, and 
environmental degradation. People are increasingly dependent on outside sources of food and water, and 
wild foods are  becoming scarce. The river is polluted,  and the forest is fragmented.

     Source:  Atampugre et al. (2022 a) 
The study also showed that most of the governance/management responses in the AASWD operate at 
multiple scales and are led by multiple actors and stakeholders. Scales of operation are at district, regional, 
and national levels, with few management platforms at the community lev el. Actors in this context include 
local people at the community level, unit committees, non -governmental organizations (NGOs), local 
governments (district assembly), national government agencies and departments, and international 
agencies. Predominant sta keholders within the AASWD (and, by extension, the Offin sub -basin SEL) were 
local people (resource users) represented by unit committees, local go vernment authorities (AAWSDA  and 
its departments and units) and government ministries and agencies (water resources commission, forestry 
commission, Community water and sanitation, etc.). NGOs and international institutions/agencies had a  
Page 13:
 13 
 limited presence in the area. The analysis showed  that there is extremely  limited coordination 
between/among these actors, resulting in counter -productive management initiatives. Production sectors 
in the district operate in isolation, which  inhibits integrated management of production systems and the 
natural resources that underpin ecosystem services needed for all the sectors. The results also showed that 
low institutional capacity, including inadequate human and financial capacity, limited  access to 
information about natural resources/ecosystem services for proper planning, and the lack of tools and 
approaches for mapping, assessing, monitoring, and practically integrating ecosystem services (ES) to 
support planning, tend to hinder integrated landscape ma nagement in the AASWD.  
4.0 Shared  landscape vision,  co-defined objectives,  and strategies  
From the situational analysis, as presented above, the AASWD needs a common vision on Inclusive 
landscape management, which they currently lack. There are several  institutions such as Governmental, 
Traditional Authorities, Farmers, Civil Society Organizations, including Development Partners and the 
Private Sector, who can play various roles in achieving  a common vision. There are also existing strategies, 
policies and regulations that could guide effective landscape management if well implemented through 
effective coordination by the local government authorities. Th us, a common landscape vision was 
discussed after members were presented with what they considered as the existing landscape situation in 
the district. After careful and lengthy deliberations, the stakeholders agreed to have the following as a 
common landscap e vision:  
""To sustainably co -harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable 
manner to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano 
South West  District .” 
Five domains were conceptualized to aid in achieving the common vision. These domains were production, 
socio -economic, human,  and crosscutting , environment , and institutional. Based on these domains, 
stakeholders were asked to prioritize two to six specific objectives in the context of co -identified landscape 
challenges (Table 1). These served as a guide i n co-developing these inclusive landscape management 
strategies  (See Section 5.0 and Appendix  A). Under Section 5.0  below , the se specific strategies are 
categorized into sustainable agricultural interventions; sustainable forestry management strategies; 
sustainable water resources management strategies; susta inable mining strategies; transformational 
decision -making and governance; empowerment and livelihood enhancement strategies; collaborative 
partnerships and resource mobilization; crosscutting  issues; and communication and awareness creation.

4.1 Mapping shared landscape vision and strategies  
As part of developing the inclusive landscape management plan for Ahafo Ano South west District 
(AASWD), stakeholders, including chiefs, heads of district assembly departments and units, community 
members and experts from FORIG, WRC, Forestry Department, CSIR -SRI, CSIR -CRI, KNUST, UCC, 
were mixed up and put into five groups for participa tory mapping exercises. The participatory mapping 
exercises were in  two phases . The initial participatory mapping exercise began with participants mapping 
the district's curr ent state using a legend they co -developed. They were provided with a base map of the

 Summary  
Inclusive landscape management (ILM) is a holistic approach to managing landscapes that considers  the 
needs of all stakeholders, including local communities, indigenous peoples, and marginalized groups. This 
Inclusive Landscape Management Plan (ILMP) seeks to provide a framework for the sustainable 
management and development of landscapes in the Ahafo  Ano Southwest District (AASWD) of Ghana. 
The ILMP is designed to address the increasing pressure on landscapes in West and Central Africa under 
TAFS -WCA initiative (from deforestation, land degradation, poor water management, unsustainable 
mining, wildlif e poaching, and climate change). The ILMP emphasizes the integration of social and 
ecological systems, local participation, and sustainable resource use and management within landscapes. 
It is a response to ‘top -down’ approaches to sustainable development,  in which power and decision -making 
are in the hands of external development professionals. Instead, the ILMP is based on shared ownership 
of decision -making and the full participation of all stakeholders.  
This ILMP is a product of a collaborative effort between the International Water Management Institute 
(IWMI), the AASWD, and local stakeholders from the Mankran micro -watershed of Ghana. The ILMP 
was developed through a participatory process that involved stakeholders from all sectors, including 
government, civil society, and the private sector. The process began with the creation of a narrative that 
served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management in the Mankran micro -
watershed. The research team then worked with local stakeholders to assess the current state of the 
landscape and identify key challenges and opportunities.   Based on the assessment, the research team and 
stakeholders co -developed a set of management strategies and interventions that are designed to address 
the key challenges and achieve the desired outcomes. The ILMP was designed with a shared vision for the 
landscape : “To sustainably co -harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable manner 
to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano Southwest  District . Based 
on the vision and identified challenges, stakeholders proposed various  response strategies  that included : 
Increase d irrigation efficiency through adaptive and inclusive management ; mechanisms to reduce 
postharvest losses ; mechanism for profit or benefit sharing from mining and forestry ; Enhance d gender 
and youth  involvement  in decision -making ; Improve d income and livelihood diversification opportunities;  
Improve d adoption of sustainable land/forest/water management practices ; Increase d food safety  through 
reduce d contamination from pesticides and galamsey (illegal small -scale mining ) the strengthening of 
local/traditional institutions for natural resources management.  The ILMP also includes a monitoring and 
evaluation framework to track progress and ensure that the interventions are having the desired impact. It 
is critical to note that t he ILMP is a living document that should  be updated on a regular basis to reflect 
changes in the landscape and the needs of the stakeholders. It is hoped that the ILMP w ould serve as a 
blueprint for sustainable and inclusive landscape management in the  AASWD  and beyond.

 1.0 Introduction  
Landscape management in West and Central Africa faces increasing pressure from deforestation, land 
degradation, poor water management, unsustainable mining, wildlife poaching, and climate change. The 
upsurge in unsustainable land use practices has resulted in ongoing environmental degradation , with 
implication s for the growing demand for food in terms of both quantity and quality, competition for 
productive land, urban expansion, demand for forest resources, demand for water resources, wildfires, soil 
health (indicated by lower nutrient status and organic content), fores t ecosystems, and water resources. 
Coupled with the mounting impacts o f anthropogenic climate change, this trend is projected to exacerbate 
exposure and vulnerability of production and livelihoods in this agrifood system, threatening its resilience.  
 
The above context justifies the urgent need for a sustainable and inclusive approach to landscape 
management. Inclusive landscape management plans (ILMP) emphasize the integration of social and 
ecological systems, local participation, and sustainable resou rce use and management within landscapes 
(Albert et al. 2014). The approach focuses on ensuring the inclusivity of decision -making processes, 
valuing diverse perspectives, and addressing power imbalances among stakeholders . The inclusive 
approach is based on shared ownership of decision -making. It is a response to ‘top -down’ approaches to 
sustainable development, in which power and decision -making is in the hands of external development 
professionals. Participation is key in advancing sustainable developmen t and considering the social 
context. Sustainable development allows for the improvement of everyone's quality of life while preserving 
and developing the natural resources on which life depends. Because problems involving unsustainable 
resource use are of ten complex and frequently need compromises and trade -offs, processes that involve 
full participation from all stakeholders typically yield the best and most lasting results. Consequently, 
success stories of inclusive landscape management depict large -scale initiatives co mprising stakeholders 
implementing coordinated interventions across a variety of land uses for a desired effect and impact.  
 
This ILMP seeks to provide a framework for the inclusive participation of stakeholders in the sustainable 
management and development of landscape s in the Ahafo Ano Southwest  District (AASWD) for socio -
economic and environmental benefits  (See Figure 1 for map of AASWD) . By prioritizing inclusivity, this 
landscape management plan aims to create a more harmonious and sustainable relationship between 
communities, ecosystems, and development, fostering resilience and equitable benefits for all. This 
strategic plan defines a broader shared vision, objectives , and a road map that would aid all stakeholders 
and institutions to contribute to the effective and sustainable management of natural resources in the 
AASWD. This would also guide the AASWD to prepare their own investment action plans towards 
achieving the overall vision. The landscape management strategy would also provide a strategic framework 
that Medium Term Development Plans  (MTDPs) of the district could link up to achieve their climate 
change and environmental/natural resources management obligations as provided by the National 
Development Planning Commission Guidelines for the preparation of MTDP.  There is also the Ghana 
Cocoa Forest REDD+  Programme (GCFRP) , which represents an innovative, unique, and highly ambitious 
programme  to reduce deforestation  and degradation in a sub -national landscape of approximately 5.9 
million ha  in Ghana.  Given that the AASWD landscape falls within the area earmarked for the 
implementation of this programme , this ILMP  also explores opportunities for building synergies and 
model s the target  landscape around the Hotspot Intervention Area (HIA) concept to benefit from the 
programme. The shared land scape vision and the elements of th is ILMP are also in line with Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) , which are the global blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future 
for all.

2.0 Methodology  
The IL MP for AASWD prescribe s an inclusive, action -oriented , and collaborative process targeted at 
delivering on the aspiration of stakeholders towards a future of social and economic progress under a 
robust natural resource management system. These principles also reflect  in the Medium -Term  
Development Plans (MTDPs) of the AASWD , Ghana’s Land degradation Neutrality  (LDN)  targets , and 
national  sustainable development priorities and targets. The key elements of this ILMP  include:  
• Shared or agreed management objectives that encompass multiple benefits from the landscape  
• Field, farm , and forest practices designed to contribute to multiple objectives, including human 
well-being, food production, climate change mitigation, and conservation of biodiversity and 
ecosystem services . 
• Ecological, social, and economic interactions among various  parts of the landscape are managed 
to realize positive synergies among interests and actors or to mitigate negative trade -offs 
• Collaborative, community -engaged processes for dialogue, planning, negotiating and monitoring 
decisions are in place . 
• Markets and public policies are contextualized  to achieve the diverse set of landscape objectives 
and institutional requirements . 
The ILMP  development  followed  the iterative  and non-linear  inclusive  planning  framework  (See Tilahun  
et al. 2023;  Atampugre  et al. 2023)  that involves  the following  key components  (See Figure  2 for a 
simplified  illustration ):  
• Definition  of goals  and objectives . 
Page 9:
 9 
 • Stakeholders  mapping  and identification  of key challenges  and demand  driven  intervention  
practices . 
• Conduct  workshops  and iterative  planning  to co-design  options  of landscape  management  plans,  
• Assessment  of and recommendations  for gender  equality  and social  inclusion  (GESI) .

Step 1: Narrative development  
The initial step of co -developing the Inclusive Landscape Management Plan (ILMP) was to create a 
narrative that served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management to enhance the 
current landscape state. A research team from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) 
together with identified regional and local stakeholder s evaluated the social ecological sustainability of the 
social ecological landscape and envisioned future strategies. To initiate this process, a suitable micro -
watershed for action was identified and this involved local stakeholders in areas facing socio -ecological 
challenges. This local involvement was essential for addressing issues related to land and water resource 
management, aiming to improve food security, income, and nutrition. The AASWD played a crucial role 
in integrating these efforts into their  plans, so their involvement in this first step was fundamental. Key 
stakeholders collaborated to define a target landscape that aligns with the narrative's goals. Accordingly, 
a micro -watershed in the Mankran watershed was co -identified  (Figure 3) .

Step 2: Resource unit assessment  
Once the Mankran micro -watershed was identified, the next step was to map competing resource units and 
establish local expert groups to represent these resource systems. The research team guided the local 
experts in co -creating inventories of critical elem ents related to land use and ecosystem services within the 
landscape. They also co -identified site -specific indicators for landscape situational analysis ( See 
Atampugre et al. 2022 a) and the assessments of future landscape performance. Citizen scientists w ere 
employed to conduct hydrological and water quality assessments different land use categories , i.e., f orest, 
agriculture,  and degraded  areas  (See Figure 4).

Step 3: Co -design , visualization , and documentation of ILMP  
The third step of the process was to develop a mid -term ILMP for the AASWD. This involved three 
workshops with the regional and community expert groups  (involving 67 participants , See Figure 5), 
focusing on  landscape challenges and vision, with emphasis on  management strategies, resource 
allocation, assigning responsibilities, and financial considerations. The workshops began with a briefing 
on the current landscape challenges  in plenary . The FGDs were organised based on gender to ensure equal 
participation and promote freedom of expression (considering the cultural setup in communities). I ssues

 related to GESI were duly considered to  enhance inclusivity.  Resource users and other stakeholders then 
co-defined a common landscape vision and specific objectives with associated strategies. The final plan 
was generated by integrating various stakeholders' perspectives  (Appendix  A and B  for detailed workshop 
plan).

Considering that this is a living ILMP, there will several follow -up activities involving piloting and testing 
of certain  technology  and innovation bundles  that were identified during the co -design phase (Step 3) . As 
part of this will be an  extensive co -validation process to evaluate the suitability and efficacy of the 
strategies . There will also be activities related to impact evaluation of ILMP interventions using the SI 
framework to measure improvements in social -ecological landscape objectives /goals . This is to facilitate 
ongoing learning and communication among stakeholders involved in landscape management.  It is also 
expected that there will be an effort to scaling out ILMP  process and its interventions  to Greater Ahafo 
Ano area . The goal is to create an inclusive and sustainable development plan that ensures the ongoing 
maintenance of landscapes and provides guidance for accommodating recent  changes driven by social, 
economic, and environmental processes. The scaling out strategies include , but not limited to, the 
following  key elements:  
• Involving Local Government: Engaging the local government as a facilitator right from the 
beginning of the process.  
• Continuous Stakeholder Engagement: Maintaining ongoing engagement with key stakeholders.  
• Presentation at Local and National Levels: Sharing the co -design process at both local and national 
levels to gain broader support.  
To scale any intervention bundles from the plan, various existing approaches may be  used:  participatory 
innovation platforms, adaptive scaling strategi es, multi -sectoral platforms, and  food system accelerator 
challenge. These strate gies must be  tailored to specific intervention s being scaled to ensure their successful 
integration into the broader  productive  landscape.

 3.0 Landscape Situational Analysis  in Ahafo Ano Southwest  District  
Using the DPSIR -SEL framework  (See Atampugre et al. 2022 b), a mix of methods, and the micro -
watershed in the Mankran watershed in the Ahafo Ano Southwest  District (AASWD) as a case, the 
research team conducted landscap e situational analysis (LSA) . The LSA aimed at giving an overview of 
how drivers and pressures combine to delineate the Social Ecological Landscape (SEL) state and impacts, 
highlighting the institutional responses. The driving forces behind the pressures that define the state of and 
impacts on the landscape are local, albeit a few national and global  drivers (Figure 6 for a summary of the 
LSA findings). The LSA showed that unregulated small -scale mining, large -scale wood exploitation, and 
the conversion of forest ecosystems into farms and plantations are growing threats to the health and 
function of the landscape (Figure 5). These activities are driven by  poverty, limited livelihood alternatives, 
and high demand for ecological resources. The impacts of these activities include food insecurity, 
biodiversity loss, livelihood destruction, and ecosystem de gradation.  The research found that human 
activities are destroying the landscape and livelihoods, and this is leading to poverty, food insecurity, and 
environmental degradation. People are increasingly dependent on outside sources of food and water, and 
wild foods are  becoming scarce. The river is polluted,  and the forest is fragmented.

     Source:  Atampugre et al. (2022 a) 
The study also showed that most of the governance/management responses in the AASWD operate at 
multiple scales and are led by multiple actors and stakeholders. Scales of operation are at district, regional, 
and national levels, with few management platforms at the community lev el. Actors in this context include 
local people at the community level, unit committees, non -governmental organizations (NGOs), local 
governments (district assembly), national government agencies and departments, and international 
agencies. Predominant sta keholders within the AASWD (and, by extension, the Offin sub -basin SEL) were 
local people (resource users) represented by unit committees, local go vernment authorities (AAWSDA  and 
its departments and units) and government ministries and agencies (water resources commission, forestry 
commission, Community water and sanitation, etc.). NGOs and international institutions/agencies had a  
Page 13:
 13 
 limited presence in the area. The analysis showed  that there is extremely  limited coordination 
between/among these actors, resulting in counter -productive management initiatives. Production sectors 
in the district operate in isolation, which  inhibits integrated management of production systems and the 
natural resources that underpin ecosystem services needed for all the sectors. The results also showed that 
low institutional capacity, including inadequate human and financial capacity, limited  access to 
information about natural resources/ecosystem services for proper planning, and the lack of tools and 
approaches for mapping, assessing, monitoring, and practically integrating ecosystem services (ES) to 
support planning, tend to hinder integrated landscape ma nagement in the AASWD.  
4.0 Shared  landscape vision,  co-defined objectives,  and strategies  
From the situational analysis, as presented above, the AASWD needs a common vision on Inclusive 
landscape management, which they currently lack. There are several  institutions such as Governmental, 
Traditional Authorities, Farmers, Civil Society Organizations, including Development Partners and the 
Private Sector, who can play various roles in achieving  a common vision. There are also existing strategies, 
policies and regulations that could guide effective landscape management if well implemented through 
effective coordination by the local government authorities. Th us, a common landscape vision was 
discussed after members were presented with what they considered as the existing landscape situation in 
the district. After careful and lengthy deliberations, the stakeholders agreed to have the following as a 
common landscap e vision:  
""To sustainably co -harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable 
manner to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano 
South West  District .” 
Five domains were conceptualized to aid in achieving the common vision. These domains were production, 
socio -economic, human,  and crosscutting , environment , and institutional. Based on these domains, 
stakeholders were asked to prioritize two to six specific objectives in the context of co -identified landscape 
challenges (Table 1). These served as a guide i n co-developing these inclusive landscape management 
strategies  (See Section 5.0 and Appendix  A). Under Section 5.0  below , the se specific strategies are 
categorized into sustainable agricultural interventions; sustainable forestry management strategies; 
sustainable water resources management strategies; susta inable mining strategies; transformational 
decision -making and governance; empowerment and livelihood enhancement strategies; collaborative 
partnerships and resource mobilization; crosscutting  issues; and communication and awareness creation.

4.1 Mapping shared landscape vision and strategies  
As part of developing the inclusive landscape management plan for Ahafo Ano South west District 
(AASWD), stakeholders, including chiefs, heads of district assembly departments and units, community 
members and experts from FORIG, WRC, Forestry Department, CSIR -SRI, CSIR -CRI, KNUST, UCC, 
were mixed up and put into five groups for participa tory mapping exercises. The participatory mapping 
exercises were in  two phases . The initial participatory mapping exercise began with participants mapping 
the district's curr ent state using a legend they co -developed. They were provided with a base map of the 
Page 15:
