The project has completed the formulation of a comprehensive management plan, which includes a narrative, assessment of the current landscape, identification of challenges, and co-development of management strategies. These activities align with Innovation Readiness Level 3, as the key concepts of inclusive landscape management have been validated through stakeholder engagement and the creation of a structured plan. However, the plan remains at the proof of concept stage, as it has not yet been tested or implemented under controlled or semi-controlled conditions. The ILMP's design and stakeholder involvement demonstrate a validated concept, but further steps are required to advance to higher readiness levels, such as controlled testing or prototype development."
