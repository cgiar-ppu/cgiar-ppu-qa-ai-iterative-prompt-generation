{ ""score"": 8, ""explanation"": ""The project demonstrated significant progress in developing and testing drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified bean varieties across 16 African countries. Completed activities included the testing of 272 lines and the engagement of 1682 farmers in Tanzania, indicating that the innovations were subjected to uncontrolled testing conditions. The systematic linking of breeding pipelines to impact areas and the standardization of impact area coding across CGIAR breeding efforts further support the maturity of the innovation. These activities suggest that the innovations are nearing proven status, as they have been validated for their ability to achieve specific impacts under uncontrolled conditions, warranting a score of 8 on the Innovation Readiness Scale."" }
