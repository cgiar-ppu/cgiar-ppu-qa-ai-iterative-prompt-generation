Executive Summary  
This report provides an overview of the CGIAR Food Systems Accelerator ( CFSA) program’s 
Kick-off workshop held at Norrsken House in Rwanda. The Kick -off workshop serves as a key 
milestone for the program  because it is the official commencement of the tech nical assistance 
of the first cohort of 10 selected agribusinesses.  
The CFSA is an agribusiness support of Work Package 3 (WP 3) within the Ukama Ustawi (UU) 
East and Southern Africa Initiative.  
The workshop brought together the CGIAR research and science community, government 
officials, entrepreneur support organisations (ESOs), investors, and financial institutions, 
along with the 10 selected agribusinesses (Accelerator Partners).  The Accelerator Partners  
(APs) come from Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda,  and Zambia, with  50% being women  founded and 
led enterprises . Collectively they work with over 39,000 smallholder farmers.  
The objective of the workshop was to introduce the Accelerator Partners (APs) to the CGIAR 
researc h community of technical assistance providers and the wider ecosystem, create an 
inclusive co -creation agenda, build an innovation community, and identify further WP 
linkages within the UU Initiative.   
The report highlights the program’s objectives, addres ses the challenges faced by 
agribusinesses in securing private sector investment, presents an outline of the needs for the 
APs as input for the program curriculum co -creation, and sets clear intentions for achieving 
WP 3’s objectives through the CFSA progr am.  
Overall, the CFSA programs aims to accelerate the scaling up of climate -smart agricultural 
solutions to smallholder farmers and other ecosystem stakeholders and build partnerships to 
promote sustainable food systems in the region.  
Introduction  
The CFSA is an agribusiness capacity -strengthening support program developed by WP 3 in 
the UU Initiative. It  is a science -driven accelerator program designed to support 
agribusinesses scale climate -smart innovations in agrifood systems to solve pressing 
problem s and to contribute to stronger and more sustainable value chains in East and 
Southern African countries. The accelerator leverages the portfolio of CGIAR innovations as 
well as the expertise of a wide network of international researchers from various disc iplines. 
Agriculture and food systems knowledge is combined with social sciences to create systemic 
change while considering commercial parameters to ensure business success.  
The CFSA program  was launched in  Nairobi, Kenya on 23rd November 2022  with IFDC -
2SCALE . This collaboration aims to showcase the synergistic relationship between a research -
driven organization like CGIAR  and an Entrepreneur Support Organisation (ESO)  like IFDC -
2SCALE , leveraging their respective strengths to bring climate -smart in novations to scale.

The CFSA team launched the 6 -month technical assistance phase of the program with an 
event at Norrsken Kigali House, Rwanda . During the event, the team introduced the first 
cohort of 10 APs  from Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda,  and Zambia  to representatives from the 
CGIAR research and science community, government officials, investors, ESOs and financial 
institutions. The event aimed to facilitate connections between the cohort and technical 
assistance providers, identify areas for innovat ive climate -smart agricultural solutions, share 
market insights, and foster collaborations among ecosystem stakeholders.  
The CGIAR  Food Systems Accelerator Overview   
The selected A Ps will receive support and training over a period of 6 months with a 
comb ination of technical assistance in climate -smart agriculture (CSA) , impact measurement 
and management (IMM)  and investment readiness . Additionally, they will receive  access to 
investors for follow -on private capital  and mentoring from industry experts. Finally, a de -
risking grant of USD 20,000 will be provided to four APs  from each of the 4 countries  that 
successfully complete the program.   The APs will continue to receive post -program support 
for sustainable growth and fundraising  after grad uating from the accelerator  through the 
program's Alumni network .  
Objective  
The objective of the accelerator program  is to support up to 30 agribusinesses (40% women -
led and 40% youth -led) with technical assistance  and facilitat e at least USD 5 million of new 
finance that has been unlocked, or in the process of being invested through debt, equity, or 
grants.  
Partners  
UU WP 1  - 5 is collaborating with the accelera tor program  by providing CSA technical support 
to the APs, whereas WP 6 is support ing on  technical support to  scale CGIAR innovations.  The 
non-CGIAR partners  supporting implementation are  IFDC -2SCALE  and The Rallying Cry .    
Focus Countries   
The program will be implemented in three phases and across 8 countries , with the first cohort 
being from Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda,  and Zambia.

Kick -off Workshop  
 
The CFSA's core team initiated an open call for applications on 23rd November 2022 , which 
attracted 849 applications  and converted into  288 highly competitive submitted applications  
from the priority target countries. Following two rounds of selection, the team co nducted 
interviews with 15 shortlisted candidates to delve deeper into their innovations that relate to 
the four priority innovation themes: mechanization and irrigation, conservation, nutrition, 
and agricultural risk management.  
After the final selection process, the CFSA successfully onboarded the top 10 agribusinesses, 
which were then revealed to a broader audience  of ecosystem stakeholders , including the 
CGIAR science and research community, government officials, investors, entrepreneur 
support organizations, and financial institutions in Rwanda on  22nd February  2023 . 
Objective of the Workshop  
The purpose of the workshop was to provide support to the APs in several  ways : 
Firstly,  the workshop aimed to familiarize them with the program so that they could fully 
understand how it operates and how it can help them achieve their goals. This included 
providing an overview of the program's key features and benefits.  
Secondly,  the worksho p aimed to establish connections between the CGIAR researchers and 
the agribusiness cohort. This was done to create a collaborative environment where both 
parties could share their expertise and knowledge to identify opportunities to support the 
APs with t echnical assistance . The researchers were able to share the latest research findings 
and innovative practices in the field of climate -smart agriculture, while the agribusiness 
cohort were able to provide valuable insights into the practicalities of impleme nting these 
practices on the ground.  A list of CGIAR researchers providing technical assistance can be 
found in the Annex.  
Thirdly , the workshop aimed to identify areas and scope of work for climate -smart agriculture 
technical assistance for the agribusiness cohort. This involved a high -level  needs assessment 
to determine the areas where the APs needed support, such as in improving ir rigation 
techniques, adopting more efficient farming practices, and developing a lending product for 
smallholder farmers .

Finally , the last objective of the workshop was to facilitate the development of strong 
relationships and collaboration opportunities  between the APs and a range of important 
ecosystem stakeholders. One of the keyways  in which this was achieved was by providing a 
range of networking opportunities throughout the event. The APs  had the opportunity to 
meet and connect with government offic ials, investors, financial institutions, agriculture 
corporates, and other key ecosystem stakeholders who were present at the workshop. This 
created a valuable platform for the APs to showcase their businesses and to learn from the 
expertise and experiences of these influential individuals and organizations.  
Discussions and Activities  
 
Day One: 22nd February 2023  
Opening remarks  
The event commenced with opening remarks from Dr Evan Girvetz, Africa Lead for Climate 
Action and Global Lead Finance and Investments for Climate Action at The Alliance of 
Bioversity - CIAT, and Co-lead for the UU initiative.

He introduced the UU initiative and its 
objectives as a regional initiative led by CGIAR 
that aims to promote agriculture, food security, 
and environmental sustainability in East and 
Southern Africa. The initiative is inspired by the 
concept of Ukama  Ustawi , which emphasizes 
the importance of building strong relationships 
and supporting one another to achieve 
prosperity and well -being. Dr Girvetz stated 
that UU brings together diverse stakeholders, 
including agribusinesses, researchers,  private 
sector funders, and policymakers to co -create solutions for sustainable development in 
agriculture in the region. It focuses on a range of thematic areas, including crop and livestock 
improvement, climate adaptation, natural resource management, a nd nutrition -sensitive 
agriculture. The initiative also recognizes the importance of gender equity and social inclusion 
in sustainable development and aims to generate evidence -based solutions that can be scaled 
up and replicated in other contexts. The col laborative approach of U U promotes learning and 
innovation.  
Dr Girvetz further introduced the CFSA program as  an agribusiness support program within 
the UU initiative. It aligns with the principles of Ukama Ustawi and emphasizes the importance 
of building strong relationships and partnerships to co -create solutions for the agriculture 
sector. The CFSA focuses on accelerating the impact of research and innovation on food 
systems, bridging the gap between research and practice by engaging diverse stakeholders.  
Finally, he presented the importance of the accelerator program to the private sector saying 
that it offers  numerous benefits, including access to innovative solutions, market 
opportunities, collaboration and partnerships, and risk management.  
• Firstly, the program provides a platform for agribusinesses and the private sector to 
access cutting -edge research and innovation in food systems. This can help 
agribusinesses  develop new products, services, and business models that are good for 
the environment  and are socially inclusive . 
• Secondly, the program supports  agribusinesses in  tapping into new markets and 
fosteri ng strong linkages, helping agribusinesses  differentiate themselves. The 
collaboration and partnership approach of the program can help the private sector 
build new relationships and networks and  co-create solutions that are more effective 
and sustainable . 
• Finally, the program can help the private sector manage risks related to food systems. 
By promoting sustainable and resilient food systems, the program can reduce risks 
related to climate change, and financial and social risks.

The second pre senter was Mr Eric Gatera, Chief 
Technical Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Animal Resources of Rwanda, represent ing the 
Ministry at the event . He highlighted the importance 
of food systems to the region . Mr Gatera highlighted 
the following:  
• Agriculture is known to be the biggest 
contributor to total employment  in Africa  
with current statistics indicating that 43.8% 
of emp loyment on the continent is attributed 
to the agricultural sector , and  52% of Africa ’s 
rural population is involved in agriculture.  
• In 2021 the government of Rwanda hosted a food systems dialogue to bring together 
governmental, non -governmental and private sector stakeholders to discuss the 
transformative future of food systems.  
• The CGIAR is a well -known agricultural research and innovation that encourages 
capacity building at a national level for several African countries for more than 50 
years . The government of Rwanda welcomes this partnership considering the new 
climate change threats that continue to present themselves in thei r food systems and 
agricultural priorities.  
In his closing remarks, Mr Eric Gatera expressed his gratitude to all the attendees for their 
active participation and interest in the future of our shared food systems. He emphasized the 
importance of strengthen ed collaboration among stakeholders to achieve the 2030 SDG 
goals, including the critical goal of ending hunger.  
The CFSA  Program Lead, Mercy Zulu -Hume,  then  made a presentation to explain the  role and 
purpose of the accelerator  program . She highlighted that one of the major challenges faced 
in agriculture in East and Southern Africa is inefficient agriculture value chains and the lack of 
resilience against climate shocks. The most affected by these inefficiencies and threats are 
the smallhold er farmers. However, the potential impact of addressing these market gaps is 
immense. Agribusinesses and agritechs across East and Southern Africa are working towards 
transforming the sector by offering new innovations that increase yields and productivity  
sustainably, de -risk and improve value chain linkages, increase farmer incomes, and 
strengthen land, food, and water systems.  
She further added that while agribusinesses and agritechs  are doing a great job in 
strengthening food systems, they still face s everal challenges and need support. One of the 
primary challenges is the need for access to the required technical skills and knowledge to 
develop and scale products and services. R&D costs are also high, which makes it difficult to 
develop stronger techni cal solutions. Additionally, regulatory issues in the agriculture sector 
in the region can be difficult to navigate, which creates problems for operations and

expansion into exports. There are also financial, environmental, and social risks that are 
diffic ult to assess and manage. At the centre  of the challenges that agribusinesses and 
agritechs  face is access to financing to expand and scale, and in some cases, to just survive. 
The agriculture sector is one of the most capital -intensive and “ capital -hungry ” investment 
sectors in the region. It was highlighted that the agribusinesses present here today can explain 
how enormous their financing needs are and just how fast money runs out. Despite this, it is 
also one of the most underfunded sectors. Over the de cades, the public sector has been 
funding agriculture, but to bridge the funding gap, we need the involvement of the private 
sector.  
Finally,  Mercy Zulu -Hume explained that to address these challenges, the CGIAR Food 
Systems Accelerator Program  was developed.  The program operates in the same way as a 
conventional accelerator program, providing investment readiness, but with one distinct 
difference. It complements  this offering with the best available scientific technical assistance 
to support ag ribusinesses and agritechs to address the challenges facing food systems.  
The program takes an evidence -based approach that ensures that the technical assistance 
offered is based on the best available scientific evidence to guarantee solutions offered are 
effective and relevant to the needs of agribusinesses and farmers. In this way, agribusinesses 
are empowered to make better decisions because they have the best available and up -to-
date information, which can improve their outcomes. The program aims to mee t 
agribusinesses at their point of need by strengthening their capacity , so they can scale CSA 
innovations to the farmers they work with  and contribute to more sustainable food systems. 
The program also aims to increase investor confidence by reducing the risk of investing in 
agribusiness ventures and providing a strong pipeline of inclusive and sustainable 
agribusiness and agritechs . 
Panel Discussion  
To discuss and provide relevant information on diversified finance options, the team 
organized a panel discussion titled "" Access to Finance for Agribusinesses in East and 
Southern Africa ,"" moderated by Mercy Zulu -Hume, the Program  Lead. The panel included 
experts such as Sheila Alumo, the Founder of East Africa Development Company Limited , and 
one of the agribusinesses selected for the program ; Judith Ngonyo, Investment Manager a t 
Goodwell Investments ; Peter Kirimi, Senior Financial Inclusion Specialist at IFDC -2SCALE; and 
Hauke Dahl, Program  Co-lead.  
 
The panel discussed that t raditional banking systems often pose a challenge for 
agribusinesses and agritechs to obtain funding, as banks require surety against the risk they 
undertake in granting loans. The panel offered various financing options, including grants, 
equity, debt financing, and venture capital, depending on the stage of the business. 
Moreover, a social bias against women in the agricultural  sector was highlighted, where Sheila

Alumo shared her experience of struggling to secure financing at the inception of her business 
due to the lack of audited financials, proven business track record, and collateral.  
To address these challenges, the CFSA has implemented robust vetting processes for 
agribusinesses, agritechs, and investors, ensuring balanced matching, risk reduction, and the 
creation of stronger pipelines with APs and investors. The panel discussion was an essential 
step towards providing r elevant information and creating opportunities for funding for 
agribusinesses and agritechs in East and Southern Africa.

Cohort Reveal  
 
The program then progressed to the cohort reveal . This marked a significant milestone in the 
program's journey towards supporting agribusinesses in East and Southern Africa. The 
unveiling ceremony was a moment of great excitement and anticipation as the program's 
team presented the selected cohort to the stakeholders  present. The cohort comprises a 
diverse group of entrepreneurs and innovators who are working on sustainable solutions to 
the challenges facing the food systems in the region. They were selected based on their 
potential to create  transformativ e impact in the agriculture sector. This first cohort includes 
a range of agribusinesses and agritechs that work across the value chain, from production and 
processing to marketing and distribution. The unveiling of this cohort is a clear demonstration 
of the program's commitment to supporting inclusive and sustainable food systems in the 
region . Collectively, these agribusinesses are working with over 40,000 smallholder farmers  
across East and Southern Africa. A summary  of the cohort is provided below:

Cohort Building Challenge  
A team -building activity was organized as the final group activity of the day for the APs and 
some of the CGIAR researchers. The activity was designed to be both physically and 
intellectually challenging, with the objective of bu ilding emotional capital that could be 
leveraged for the next 6 months of the accelerator and beyond. The activity was facilitated by 
AnnRita Njiru from The Rallying Cry, and after its completion, a discussion was held on lessons 
from the challenge that co uld be applied to entrepreneurship.  
The participants highlighted several key takeaways, including the importance of an enabling 
environment for achieving business goals, setting realistic goals,  and taking practical action to 
achieve them, the need for in vestors to be more empathetic with entrepreneurs, and the 
benefits of choosing the path of least resistance and focusing on low -hanging fruits first in 
terms of strategy and goal setting. The team -building  event concluded with an informal 
networking session among all participants .

Day Two : 23rd February 2023  
Program Introduction and Overview  
The main objective of the day was to have a formal introduction of the Technical Assistance 
providers and the APs. The main focus was to establish an env ironment that will encourage 
both parties to participate in co -creating the program curriculum. This will be done by 
conducting a needs a ssessment  of the A Ps. The accelerator program will be executed in three 
phases, namely:  
1. Diagnostics phase (needs assessment) ( 1 month)  
2. Design phase  (co-creation)  (1 month)

The second day of the workshop included the APs, CGIAR researchers and investment 
readiness TA advisors . The first item on the agenda was a session led by Carey  Bohjanen , in 
which the A Ps shared their feedback  on the workshop so far. The participants used words 
such as ""exciting,"" ""eye -opening,"" ""inspiring,"" ""invigorating,"" ""valuable,"" ""informative, "" 
""promising,"" and ""surprising"" to describe their experience. Based on this feedback, Carey  
Bohjanen  guided the Accelerator Partners in identifying their priority technical assistance 
needs. The resulting "" wish list "" is summarized below:

Design and Diagnostics Session  
During the workshop, IFDC -2SCALE, who are implementing partners in the CFSA program , 
emphasized the importance of setting expectations from the agribusiness point of view to 
avoid redundancy in the program's design. It was noted that the APs need to understand how 
the program will benefit their businesses, avoid repetition that is common  in various 
accelerator programs, and capture the interests of all stakeholders involved.  
To achieve this, Salome Ng’ang’a and Peter Muthee from IFDC -2SCALE introduced the 
Problem, Solution, and Impact (PSI) Framework, with a focus on creating shared busi ness 
value. This framework will be integrated into the six -month technical assistance programming 
starting on March 1st, 2023, as a d iagnostic  and d esign  process to develop a solution and 
program specific to the partner's needs.  
To wrap up the day, some CGIAR technical assistance specialists presented on climate -smart 
topical focus areas. The main focus was on Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI), I mpact 
Measurement and Management (IMM), and the Enabling Environment (EE). These areas are 
key themes  of the CFSA  in achieving its intended objectives : 
Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) – Dr Karen Nortje, Senior Researcher  
(IWMI)  
One of the UU i nitiative's objectives is to include  women and youth in 
empowering their engagement in the agribusiness ecosystems by 
mapping challenges and opportunities to address gender and social 
inequality and applying inclusive and coordinated interventions for 
transformative change. WP 5  (Gender Equa lity and Social Inclusion 
(GESI) ) represented by Dr Karen Nortje, seek to support the CFSA  by
