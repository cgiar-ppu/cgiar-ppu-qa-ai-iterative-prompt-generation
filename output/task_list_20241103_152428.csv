**Text to Analyze:** **Text to Analyze:** [INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o","None","Targeted simulations help breeders to optimize breeding schemes aligned with the desirable characteristics of farmer- and market demanded crop varieties. Tools were deployed to CGIAR breeders to optimize breeding schemes aligned with the desirable characteristics of farmer- and market-demanded crop varieties. These include simulation scripts, results, recommendations, which are publicly accessible on www.excellenceinbreedingplatform.org.  The Breeding Pipeline Manager was originally made available to both CGIAR and non-CGIAR users to capture information on breeding schemes, market segments, target product profiles and breeding pipelines. Between 2021 and 2023, there were 117 CGIAR users and 245 Non-CGIAR users. For quality assurance purposes, we adjusted the tool for CGIAR users, to link with market segments, target product profiles and breeding pipelines hosted and quality-controlled in the Breeding Portal. The existing tool stayed available for non-CGIAR users on https://bsm.excellenceinbreeding.org/. Among non-CGIAR users, 109 users uploaded data, 136 only viewed the tool.

They were improved in collaboration with over 600 partner orgnizations in Africa, Asia and Latin America. 165 varieties are climate-resilient. 50 are biofortified and directed to lower malnutrition among women and children. Germplasm registrations are no guarantee for multiplication and use but they are an important milestone. Many countries require variety registration for commercialization. Variety registrations were from: Barley, Beans, Cassava, Cowpea, Lentil, Maize, Potato, Rice, Soybean, Sweet Potato, Wheat, and 
Yam. 112 varieties were registered in Africa (19 countries), 61 in Asia (10 countries), 23 in Latin America (6 countries), and one in Europe. 79% were registered in low and lower-middle income economies where more than 93% of all people with incomes below $2.15 a day live.

 Abstract  
 
This technical report presents a comprehensive overview of the pilot initiative for site-specific 
and season -smart fertilizer recommendations (SSFR) implemented during the 2022/2023 wheat 
farming season in Ethiopia. The initiative, led by key demand partners such as Digital Green in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), utilized the advisoryintegrated with the 
Ethiopian Digital Agro -Climate Advisory Platform (EDACaP), targeting smallholder farmers 
through various dissemination channels.  The collaborative effort, involving MoA, the  Ethiopian 
Institute of Agrocultural Research ( EIAR ), GIZ -Ethiopia (Supporting Soil Health Inistitives, SSHI) , 
CGIAR EiA (Excellence in Agronomy) Initiative , the Accelerating CGIAR Climate Research in Africa 
(AICCRA) project , and Digital Green  aimed at co -creating tailored agro -advisory content and 
employing agile dissemination channels. A customized decision support tool ( DST) was developed 
to guide planners, extension workers, and farmers in making optimal planting decisions and 
fertilizer use.  The report details the training of extension agents, using  different dissemination 
channels, primarily using a Telegram bot for communicating the advisory services , and the 
challenges faced during the pilot, such as fertilizer shortages and limited internet coverage. The 
findings in August 2023 highlight the effectiveness of the advisory, reaching 50,200  farmers, out 
of which 8,316 farmers adopt ing the recommendations. Notably, 20% of adopters were women . 
The achievement is notable considering the fact that the season was characterized with severe 
shortage or fertilizer and very high cost.  The report also highlights key lessons learned, 
emphasizing the importance of contextual understanding, collaboration between organizations, 
and engagement at both the local and ministry levels. The pilot's success underscores the 
demand for customized advisories and sets the stage for broader adoption and impact w ithin the

 1. Background  
 
This technical report encompasses several key areas  in piloting site-specific and season -smart 
fertilizer recommendations  (SSFRs) . NextGen agroadvisory DST integrated  with EDACaP,  tailored 
to the specific site , seasonal climate,  and household conditions , is the key initiative  for piloting . 
The advice from this tool is being extensively piloted across wheat farming systems in Ethiopia 
during the 2022 /2023 season. Digital Green  is pivotal  as the principal partner leading the piloting 
exercise.  Primarily, a  Telegram bot approach has been  used to disseminate NextGen advisory to 
smallholder farmers and gather feedback from farmers. This is also integrated with other 
channels  (maps  and videos) to test which combinations of options are preferable by different 
groups of farmers. A dashboard developed by Digital Green is used to get near real -time feedback 
on the number of wheat growers targeted, reached, and adopted the advisory during th e 2023 
crop season.  
 
An innovative collaboration has been established, bringing together governmental organizations, 
non-profit developmental institutions, and private sector entities, including Digital  Green and 
MoA . This partnership is dedicated to fostering co -creation, generating agro -advisory content, 
and employing agile dissemination channels to effectively reach extension workers and farmers 
while actively collecting valuable feedback. The tangible result of th is concerted effort is the co -
development of a customized, SSFRs Decision Support Tool (DST). This DST guides  planners, 
extension workers, and farmers on optimal planting decisions and the required types and 
amounts of fertilizers.  
 
Validation results of the NextGen agroadvisory during the 2021/2022 cropping season have 
demonstrated significant positive impacts on wheat production. That is, the average grain yield 
increased by 24%, nutrient use efficiency improved by 40%, water use ef ficiency increased by 
15%, and overall profitability exceeded $1100 per hectare per season compared to blanket 
recommendations (Report ; Manuscript under review ). Building on these accomplishments, 
Digital Green, the primary scaling partner of the Use Case, is currently engaged in an extensive 
pilot of the advisory across 16 wheat -growing districts and 201 Kebeles in Ethiopia for the 
2022/2023 season. The selection of piloting sites was based on the wheat growing potential, with 
Digital Green operating in partnership with local agricultural bureaus and development agents 
(DAs). The criteria for selection included accessibility for implementation, monitoring capabilit ies, 
and farmers' willingness to attend training and implement recommendations. Specific Kebeles 
were identified , considering the availability of DAs to support the piloting.  
 
Agricultural extension services in Ethiopia have relied on blanket fertilizer recommendations. 
However, with evolving scientific insights and a deeper understanding of localized needs, there 
is a growing acknowledgment that a one -size-fits-all approach may not be optimal. The Ethiopian 
Extension Service recognizes this paradigm shift . It is committed to adopting SSFR , a more 
nuanced and customized strategy in providing fertilizer recommendations tailored to the local 
context of smallholder farmers.

 2. Site selection and training   
 
After identifying  sites, extension agents received training on the advisory information service, 
including the purpose and utilization of the main dissemination channels. Digital Green 
developed the telegram bot (this link ). A variety of approaches, such as combinations of video, 
maps, and face -to-face dissemination, were employed to pilot the advisory during the 2022/2023 
cropping season (Fig. 1). The telegram bot was utilized to monitor and track the progress of DAs, 
recording the number of smallholder farmers targeted, reached, and willing to adopt the 
NextGen advisory in near real -time throughout the 2023 rainy season. A total of 746 extension 
agents (535 male and 211 female) received training across the 201 Kebele s (Fig. 1).

dissemination training, with  (a) highlighting the participation of agricultural  experts and 
development agents  in the process  (b).  
 
3. Farmers reached /exposed  and implemented  the advisory   
 
After the training, the Digital Green team, alongside extension agents who were equipped with 
knowledge about the advisory content and dissemination channels, conducted awareness 
creation and training sessions on fertilizer recommendations and other agronomic practices for 
farmer s within the selected Kebeles. The advisory was disseminated through a multi -faceted 
approach and channel media (i.e., telegram bot  only , video -based  extension , or a combination of  
telegram bot  and video ). According to the Digital Green Dashboard feedback report in September 
2023, Aaround 108,955 smallholder wheat growers across 16 woredas are expected to receive 
the advisory with the telegram bot, along with other dissemination channels, such as video and 
digital maps . Among the total wheat growers, over 28,400 farmers expressed their willingness to 
implement the advisory in Ethiopia  across 170 Kebeles in three regions (Table 1). The data 
gathered from telegram bot usage highlights the extensive use of this channel by development 
agents to connect with numerous smallholder wheat growers.  
 
After the implementation efforts in August  2023 , the advisory reached 50,200 farmers have 
received the advisory successfully through the various media mentioned earlier, of which 6,800 
farmers implemented the SSFR  and 25% were women (Fig . 2). The relatively lower number of 
farmers adopting the advisory during the 2022/2023 season was attributed to the critical 
Page 6:

 fertilizer shortage and soaring prices in the country (e.g., see this link  and this link ). Because of 
those challenges, many  farmers in Ethiopia could not apply fertilizer at all or did not apply  the 
required amount of fertilizer. At the same time, s ecurity issues  in some part s of the country also 
undermined fertilizer access and utilization by some farmers, which also affected the project.

4. Piloting implementation by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA)  
 
Historically, agricultural extension services in Ethiopia have relied on blanket fertilizer 
recommendations. However, with evolving scientific insights and a deeper understanding of 
localized needs, there is a growing acknowledgment that a one -size-fits-all approach may not be 
optimal. The Ethiopian Extension Service recognizes this pa radigm shift . It is committed to 
adopting SSFRs , a more nuanced and customized strategy in providing fertilizer 
recommendations tailored to the local context of smallholder farmers.

 In the main cropping season of 2023, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) initiated the pilot of SSFRs  
in Doyogena district by collaborating with the Agricultural Commercialization Cluster (ACC) 
through Farmers, Research, and Extension (FRE) linkage facilitation. ACC production has emerged 
as a promising strategy for enhancing wheat production and producti vity in Ethiopia. The 
alignment of FRE and ACCs fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among farmers, 
researchers, and other stakeholders. It concentrat es resources and expertise in the district, 
promoting the adoption of LSFR and other improved technologies and practices.  
 
Facilitated by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), the Alliance, and GIZ, a pilot project for SSFR  for 
wheat was initiated in Doyogena District, Gomora Kebele. This initiative brought together 185 
farmers, forming a cluster covering 35 hectares of land. The district office of agriculture played a 
crucial role in establishing the Agricultural Commercial ization Cluster (ACC) and implementing 
the LSFRs. They identified sites, delineated the cluster, collected GPS points for each farmer's 
field, and shared this information with the Alliance to generate personalized LSFRs for each 
farmer's plot.  
 
5. Recognition of the potential of LSFR by the MoA  
 
A field day was organized in September 2023 to provide farmers, agricultural experts, extension 
workers, and zonal administrators with the opportunity to observe and learn from practitioners 
about successful practices and experiences related to SSFRs  and wheat clustering at Gomora 
Keble in the Doyogena and Shumu kebele in the Lemo district. Figure 4 showcases the 
performance of SSFRs  beneficiary farmers in the Doyogena district, demonstrated to participants 
during the field day.  
  
A total of 140 participants attended, including 120 men, 20 women, 56 extension workers, and 7 
individuals from the media and other sectors. The significance of LSFR, tailored to the specific 
needs of each field, was highlighted during the field day held i n Doyogena (Gomora kebele) and 
Lemo district (Shurmu kebele), aimed at enhancing wheat productivity. The event in the Kenbata 
and Hadiya zones was broadcasted on regional channels.

 6. Challenges Encountered During the Pilot Implementation  
 
• Shortage of Chemical Fertilizer:  One notable challenge surfaced during the second and 
third phases of the LSFR pilot program, where a lack of chemical fertilizer hindered the 
intended outreach to many farmers. This issue was particularly evident during the 2022 
and 2023 cropping seasons.  
• Weak Adoption of Organic Fertilizer:  Despite being presented as an alternative 
recommendation in the advisory, the adoption of organic fertilizer faced several hurdles, 
including labor -intensive production and transportation to the field, Requirement of 
substantial materials (dry materials, wet materials, and water) for preparation, and 
negative perception among farmers due to the unpleasant odor during preparation, a 
common issue in the conventional composting process if not managed properly.  
• Limited Internet Coverage:  In the pilot woredas, there is a challenge related to limited 
internet coverage. As the telegram bot serves as one of the channels for delivering the 
advisory during this cropping season, the restricted internet access poses difficulties for 
Development A gents (DAs) to retrieve the advisory on their phones.  
 
7. Key Findings from the pilot ing and Lessons learn ed 
 
• Government Adoption and Demand:  From  the validation process up to now , the 
government has demonstrated a strong willingness to accept and adopt the advisory. This 
underscores a n apparent demand for customized advisories. Addressing farmers' needs 
in this context requires additional efforts to ensure the effectiveness of our advisory 
services.  
• Collaboration Between Digital Green and Alliance of Bioversity &  CIAT  (ABC) : Digital 
Green and ABC, as organizations with distinct areas of expertise, have the potential to 
generate significant and impactful results by coordinating with each other. Such 
collaboration can play a transformative role in influencing the extension and research 
systems withi n the country.  
• Lesson on Contextual Understanding:  The pilot has highlighted the importance of 
understanding the context on the ground and pinpointing areas for integration and 
collaboration. This lesson underscores the need for tailored approaches that resonate 
with the local environment.  
• Government Engagement at Woreda and Zonal Levels:  Close collaboration with 
government offices at  the Woreda and Zonal levels has been a crucial factor contributing 
to the successful outcomes of the pilot. This emphasizes the significance of engaging with 
local decision -makers to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of interventions.  
• Influence at the Ministry Level:  Another key lesson learned is the importance of working 
closely with decision -making offices at the Ministry level. This engagement can potentially  
wield significant influence over the broader extension system, thereby amplifying the 
impact of the initiative.

In addition to achieving this primary objective, the adoption of these technologies generates positive environmental externalities, such as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Plant breeding continues with the objectives of obtaining materials with higher nutritional quality, nitrogen-use-efficiency, and the ability to regenerate and avoid soil degradation. Colombia, Kenya, and Ethiopia are examples for countries, where cattle plays an important role for the rural population and the agricultural gross domestic product. Cattle production in these countries is mostly dependent on forage materials with low quality and scarcity of feeds happens frequently in prolonged dry seasons and under climate change. The adoption of Urochloa hybrids helps in this regard.

They usually have limited access to existing climate information or do not have the skills to understand/use the information to be more climate resilient. The Local Technical Agroclimatic Committees -LTAC are helping to overcome these limitations by co-producing, translating, and transferring tailored agroclimatic information to enable agricultural decision-making. During 2022, the design and the improvements of CIS communication products assuring segments of the rural population that were not reached before and include (i)improved and easy-to-understand seasonal (quarterly) agroclimatic bulletins to local stakeholders and farmers; (ii)new weather agroclimatic bulletins (bi-weekly) disseminated by LTAC social network groups; (iii)participatory CIS approaches directly reaching 2k people in eastern Guatemala; and (iv)radio spots derived from the mentioned bulletins in the eastern region.

 Abstract 
It is necessary to continuously monitor and evaluate the development of climate 
services in countries where CGIAR and its partners promote different approaches 
related to these. Here we show the application of a monitoring and evaluation 
instrument that has the objective of analyzing the scope, effectiveness, perception, and 
relevance of the Local Technical Agroclimatic Committees (MTA, initials in Spanish) 
of Guatemala. The instrument was effectively applied to nearly 300 participants from 
the Guatemalan MTAs to assess the fundamental aspects that must be taken into 
account for the proper functioning of the committees in the country, as well as the 
challenges and barriers faced by co-production, transfer, translation, and use of 
agroclimatic information. The results generally show a high adoption by users of the 
climate services promoted in Guatemala, highlighting their usefulness and relevance 
in the country.

Introduction 
Guatemala is one of the Central American countries most affected by climate 
variability, particularly drought conditions, which, together with vulnerable 
socioeconomic conditions, limit the livelihood of families and their food security. 
Large losses occur every year in the country's productive systems, mainly affecting 
small producers, who face losses of up to 70% of their crops, especially during the 
mid-summer drought season. To help address this problem, the CGIAR has been 
promoting for the last 5 years the implementation of climate services that integrate 
climate information adapted to the needs of users to support decision-making in the 
field and avoid losses at the local level, in particular, the Local Technical 
Agroclimatic Committees (MTA, by its initials in Spanish). 
Like other Latin American countries, the MTAs in Guatemala are open spaces for 
dialogue between actors representing different public and private institutions, 
associations, academies, cooperatives, Non-Governmental Organizations, and 
international cooperation, among others, together with local agricultural producers of 
each region, to understand the possible behavior of the climate at the local level. 
Based on the seasonal climate information and the meteorological information issued 
by INSIVUMEH, agroclimatic recommendations are analyzed, discussed, and issued 
to help reduce the risks related to climate variability. 
The first MTA was established in Guatemala in the department of Chiquimula in 
2018. Since then to date, they have been rapidly establishing themselves throughout 
the country. In 2019, the MTAs of El Progreso, Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango, and 
Centro was established. In 2020, MTAs were established in the departments of 
Page 15:
 
14 
 Zacapa, Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Huehuetenango, San Marcos, and Quiché. 
During the year 2021, new MTAs were established in the departments of Jutiapa, 
Petén, Sololá, Santa Rosa, Izabal, Jalapa, Escuintla, and the Southwestern area. To 
date, there are 19 active MTAs, whose area of influence covers 100% of the national 
territory (see Figure 1). 
 
Figure 1. Local Technical Agroclimatic Committees in Guatemala and areas of 
influence of the different CGIAR initiatives (updated Dec 2022) 
 
Given that the strengthening and scaling-out of the MTAs have aroused significant 
interest on the part of the actors of more than 100 institutions that participate in the 
committees, and that also, a large part of the information generated by the committees 
is used in the field for decision-making support, it is essential to carry out a 
monitoring and evaluation process that allows the identification of the fundamental 
aspects for the proper functioning of these spaces, as well as challenges and barriers 
faced by the co-production, transfer, translation, and use of information by local 
communities, implementing improvements.

 Here we present the application of a monitoring and evaluation instrument, which was 
designed in previous years by CGIAR and its partners (Navarro-Racines, Zúñiga, et 
al., 2020) to around 300 participants from Guatemalan MTAs. This work is part of the 
activities of the new portfolio of CGIAR research initiatives  (see Figure 1), in 
particular the Climate Resilient  initiative (Work Package 1),  which is promoting the 
scale-up and adoption of climate information service tools nutrition sensitivity and 
capacity building in agroclimatic risk management in Guatemala, Senegal, and 
Kenya, and is providing fundamental support in the strategic coordination of MTAs in 
Guatemala. It is also supported by the AgriLAC Resiliente  initiative (Work Package 2)  
that seeks to empower stakeholders through a digital ecosystem in Guatemala, 
Honduras, and Colombia to offer digitally enabled agricultural advisory services for 
farmers who manage climate risk and sustainable intensification more effectively and 
is mainstreaming changes in the MTA’s dissemination mechanisms in Guatemala. 
And finally, it is supported by the Livestock and Climate  initiative (Work Package 2)  
which is developing digital services that bring together personalized climate 
information, risk transfer, and credit strategies to manage climate risk and inform 
decision-making in the livestock sector from Guatemala, Senegal, and Kenya, and is 
promoting access to climate services for livestock producers in Guatemala.

 Methods 
To analyze the scope, effectiveness, perception, and relevance of the MTA in 
Guatemala, in 2020 a monitoring and evaluation instrument was designed (Navarro-
Racines, Zúñiga, et al., 2020) in a joint effort between the International Research 
Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), the CGIAR Research Program on Climate 
Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and the National Institute of 
Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology of Guatemala 
(INSIVUMEH). In 2020, the first round of application of the surveys was carried out, 
and in 2022 a second round which results are shown in this document. 
The instrument was designed as a structured survey, with five sections including 1) 
personal characterization,  which seeks to know the type of committee participant in 
terms of gender, ethnic group, and occupation; 2) characterization of crops and 
climate, to identify the main agricultural systems in each region as well as the most 
recurring problems related to them; 3) perception of the quality of climate 
information,  which seeks to identify the degree of understanding and confidence in 
the climate information displayed through the MTAs; 4) related aspects the 
agroclimatic bulletin,  which seeks to understand the scope of the agroclimatic 
information disseminated through the MTAs in terms of several users, as well as the 
perception of the relevance of the agricultural recommendations that are incorporated 
into the bulletins; and 5) suggestions,  both from the agroclimatic bulletins and from 
the dynamics of the MTAs meetings. The instrument questions are shown below.

Instrument application 
The monitoring and evaluation instrument was designed to be applied through an 
online format (Google Forms), to members of the 19 MTAs of Guatemala during 
October, November, and December 2022. People were contacted through telephone 
Page 22:

 calls through the personal data that each person personally provided in the registration 
records committee assistance.  
The final size of the sample was 294 people belonging to the 19 MTAs, as can be seen 
in the Table below. To carry out the surveys, we had the support of a student from the 
Faculty of Agronomy of the University of San Carlos (USAC) of Guatemala, who 
was linked as a temporary intern to the work team of the Inter-American Institute for 
Cooperation on Agriculture – IICA.

 Results 
Characterization  
Sex 
Figure 2 shows the results of the consultation on gender. As observed in the graphs, in 
most of the national territory, the participation of the male gender predominates in the 
MTAs with a percentage greater than 80%, especially in Alta Verapaz, Jalapa, and 
Suroccidente (Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez) where they reach 100%. In the 
departments of Quetzaltenango, Totonicapán, and Sololá, in the western part of the 
country, there is more participation of women. Especially in Totonicapán with 50% 
and Quetzaltenango with 25%, the latter being the second most economically 
important city in the country. Other MTAs that have more than 20% female 
participation are El Progreso and Santa Rosa, in the eastern part of the country. 
The results highlight the inequalities that exist between men and women in Guatemala 
above other Latin American countries. According to a report by the United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP), Guatemala is in a deficient situation, with the highest 
gender inequality index (IDG), the highest in the Latin American region (0.479), 
showing high differences that disadvantaged women about men (UNDP, 2022). Even 
though the participation of women has grown in recent years in the MTAs, gender 
inequality persists in terms of access to agroclimatic information, and it is necessary 
to continue working from the research field to close this gap.

 Ethnic group   
As can be seen in Figure 3, the actors of 12 of the 19 MTAs that are in the country 
identify themselves mainly as ladinos (>90%). In the western MTAs (Quetzaltenango, 
Totonicapán, and Sololá), an important part of the participants identifies themselves 
as people of indigenous descent (15% to 40%), while the northern (Alta Verapaz) and 
eastern (Zacapa and Santa Rosa MTAs), a lower percentage consider themselves 
indigenous (>10%). 
Guatemala is one of the countries with the largest populations of indigenous people, 
with more than 80% of the total in the region (World Bank, 2015). The last census of 
2018 indicates that 42% of the population identifies as belonging to indigenous people 
(INE, 2018). Even though it is a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual country, 
discrimination and inequality against indigenous people persist (IACHR, 2022). The 
participation of people belonging to indigenous communities in territorial agreement 
spaces such as MTAs is an indicator of how climate services in the country can 
continue to contribute to social inclusion in aspects such as access to information and 
the representativeness of these communities in spaces of public debate. 
Types of institution 
Figure 4 shows the results of the question related to the types of institutions that are 
part of the MTAs. Even though efforts have been made to achieve diverse institutional 
participation, the presence of the public sector (ministries, secretariats, the 
meteorological service, or similar) predominates in most of the committees.

Although there are committees with full public sector participation, such as those in 
Huehuetenango and Suroccidente, there are also more heterogeneous ones (e.g.,

 highlighting the MTAs of Totonicapán and Chiquimula, committees that have 
different sectors represented more equitably. It is important to mention the increased 
participation of academia, NGOs, international cooperation, and producer 
associations, in recent years in all MTAs.  
The participation of individual farmers in the MTAs is low, however, there are 
important efforts in committees such as Zacapa, Chiquimula, and Izabal to integrate 
them into the meetings. Farmers mainly receive agroclimatic information through 
extension agents from local agricultural associations, cooperatives, and from the 
ministry of agriculture, who are highly represented at the committees (e.g., El

PRM improves the productivity of rangelands and access to resources for local rangelands users (communities). In 2018, the European Union invested Euro 1.5 million in the Piloting of PRM Project in Baringo County, Kenya and six shared grazing lands in Tanzania (targeting 450,000 pastoralists and agropastoralists). In 2020/21 PRM is being upscaled through a USD 30 million investment on 8.8 million hectares in Ethiopia.

ACB is produced based on seasonal, monthly, or 10-day weather forecast through the interaction of different players along the climate service value chain. 

The ACB is now being implemented in 8 provinces, 7 in the Mekong River Delta and 1 in South Central Coast, with 351 communes in total, with interest from other provinces and regions in the country. The bulletins are disseminated via multiple communication channels, including printed posters, Zalo groups, loudspeakers, extension staff and through meetings of local partners (e.g., commune people’s committees, Farmers’ Union). Through Zalo/mobile app, the project reached an estimated 130,000 farmers although a larger group may be exposed through posters, loudspeakers, and other channels. Due to lack of information to provide sex disaggregations, a 50:50 ratio was assumed.

Wheat blast is a devastating fungal disease that appeared in Bangladesh in 2016 and affected 15,000 hectares resulting in  25%–30% crop losses and reducing wheat production of up to 85 million tons, equivalent to USD13 million. This disease is tightly linked to climate extremes that render it highly infectious. Since then, Bangladesh has remained on alert given the risk of subsequent outbreaks. To fulfill farmers’ seed demand, during this reporting period the Activity established 25 demonstration plots utilizing 25 farmers’ fields covering three hectares of land in the Dinajpur region, in collaboration with Bangladesh Wheat and Maize Research Institute (BWMRI) and Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), and facilitated training for participating farmers and a number of dealers in wheat quality seed production and preservation. CSISA also provided technical support to local seed companies, of which seven produced a total of 81.48 tons of the new variety wheat seeds: BARI Gom 33 (33 tons), BARI Gom 32 (38.7 tons), BARI Gom 30 (8.2 tons) and WMARI 3 (1.3 tons).

This work is associated with Outcome of IO2.2 under work package three of TAFSSA. During the reporting period, Cereal Systems Initiative in South Asia in alignment with TAFSSA refined an interactive voice response (IVR) system for mung bean farmers in some coastal areas of Bangladesh. This IVR system provides real-time weather alerts, warning farmers to harvest their mung bean ahead of forecasted heavy rainfall events which could damage their crop. This automated IVR system issued a total of 2444,478 IVR calls to 10,446 mung bean farmers in 17 selected unions during the peak of the mung bean harvesting season. The CSISA research team analyzed the IVR call data and found that of the 310,269 location-specific advisory IVR calls automatically generated by the system, 41% were successfully received and listened to by farmers, with many of them acting to save their crop from damage that could have been incurred due to heavy rainfall events before harvest. We are now working to secure a private sector partner willing to take on long-term operation and financing of the IVR system.  ","403"

The project team worked directly with 6,335 farmers in eight districts of Odisha and one district of Assam to implement SFLF aggregation model to achieve economies of scale in the farm operation and bargaining power in input and output markets. The participating farmers have been able to double their potato yield from 13 to 25 tons per hectare because of quality planting materials and improved production practices. The profitability of SFLF farmers have increased more than 200 percent because of higher yield, lower cost and premium price for their produce.

IPSR seeks to achieve four objectives:
1. Keep overview and track Innovations in an evidence-based way (Innovation Profiling)
2. Agricultural innovation system synergies around packages of innovation (design innovation packages and assess their scaling readiness)
3. Fit-for-purpose partnerships to tackle innovation and scaling bottlenecks (Scaling Strategies)
4. Inform CGIAR innovation portfolio management (prioritization, portfolio diversity, risk management, strategic resource mobilization)

In 2023, CGIAR Initiatives reported on 477 Innovations under development using key Scaling Readiness metrics. Several CGIAR funders have expressed interest in learning more about the Scaling Readiness approach and how CGIAR is mainstreaming it.

It was developed by the GANSO (GANadería SOstenible / Sustainable Livestock) organization, co-founded by the Alliance BI-CIAT, created to improve the livestock production systems in the Colombian Eastern Plains, from extensive degraded pastures and soils to productive and sustainable landscapes. The guarantee has grown and developed as a set of 5 pillars (environment, people, animal welfare, management & meat quality) and 52 practices are independently assessed and categorized in order of their compliance level. This gives the farmers incentives to sell beef at a premium price, supported by the consumers' willingness to pay for environmental-friendly products. These products have been uptake by one the largest retail store in Colombia, with 182 stores in 6 cities. Starting in Meta department, now the tool is being implemented in other departments of the Orinoquia region.

aGrazed livestock systems are the world’s single 
biggest land use and a big source of GHG 
emissions. Can improved forages make a 
difference?

Enteric fermentation
1.Methane is produced by enteric fermentation 
where microbes decompose and ferment 
celluloses, fiber, starches, and sugars.
2.Enteric methane is one by -product of this 
digestive process and is expelled by the 
animal through burping. 
3.While other by -products (acetate, propionate 
and butyrate) are absorbed by the animal and 
used as energy precursors to produce milk, 
meat, leather and wool.

What is GANSO’s guarantee?
✓Voluntary evaluation tool for farms interested in evaluating their 
management.
✓Guarantee mechanism for the market.
✓It allows for the continuous improvement of livestock farms.
✓Has been developed in response to a growing demand in the Colombian 
market for sustainable beef products and zero deforestation. 
✓It is framed within the objectives and principles of the Global 
Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB).
hdl.handle.net/10568/110456
How does it work?
The GANSO Guarantee has four pillars which group a set of fifty practices of 
sustainable cattle production that are verified by an independent evaluating 
entity.
✓Environment (40%)
✓People (20%)✓Management (20%)
✓Cattle (20%)
Page 12:
Page 13:
✓Although livestock (cattle) is an important source of income for farmers, it is also a significant source of GHG emissions.
✓Well managed tropical forages can help intensify production in less area (sustainable intensification).
✓The inclusion of forage legumes that are rich in tannins and saponins (secondary metabolites) can improve productivity 
and at the same time reduce methane emissions.
✓Some improved grasses ( Brachiaria and Panicum ) exhibit BNI abilities that increase NUE and reduce nitrous oxide 
emissions.
✓Mitigation technologies exist and farmers need guidance in technical and financial aspects to implement them.
✓Markets and consumers can play an important role in supporting sustainable livestock practices at farm level.
✓Deforestation and cattle traceability system is needed to avoid cattle associated with deforestation to enter to the 
deforestation -free value chain.Concluding remarks

Use of such pellets also alleviates pressure on rangelands or grasslands.  This innovation consists of a small scale compressor 'pelletizer' and formulas to create qualitatively suﬃcient feed pellets with locally available inputs. In Tunisia, there are many agro-pastoralists that are dependent on expensive and imported livestock feed pellets to improve livestock quality and to supplement feed shortages. Risks of relative feed shortages are likely to increase due to climate change. Also there are many discarded by-products from local agro-food supply chains such as olive cakes, date kernels, and downgraded dates, which still contain nutrients. Feed pellet production with this small scale pelletizer producing 500 kg pellets / hour is also an interesting income generating activity for farmer organizations and creates employment.

TURNING WASTE INTO NUTRITIOUS 
ANIMAL FEED 
Researchers from the International Centre for Agricultural Research in 
the Dry Areas (ICARDA), together with livestock implementing partners 
in Tunisia, set out to locally manufacture feed pellets that would be 
of value to livestock farmers and that would use agro-industrial by-
products. Olive cakes and cactus peels are examples of valuable feed 
ingredients that would otherwise be discarded but have proven to 
serve as valuable, locally available, cost-effective inputs for farmers 
to feed their livestock.

The initiative to manufacture feed pellets stemmed from 
an original idea of producing feed blocks. A feed block 
manufacturing unit was developed in collaboration with a 
Tunisian metal manufacturer and aimed to encourage private 
enterprises and cooperatives to produce and sell the feed blocks 
to smallholder livestock farmers. The unit, which could produce 
up to five tons of feed blocks per day, was tested on various 
enterprises, including an apple farmer cooperative that wanted 
to add value to overripe apples, which would otherwise have 
been discarded. 
Over three years, many lessons were learnt. The idea was 
improved and transformed into the production of feed pellets, 
a nutritious supplementary feed competing with expensive 
imported concentrates, proving to be valuable for various 
farming sectors in Tunisia. 
Feed pellets, made from agro-industrial by-products, are 
thoroughly dried and are highly resistant to rotting. In addition, 
they are small and can be rationed accurately. The bags are easy 
to manage and store, and can withstand rough handling during 
loading and transport, which minimizes waste. 
An important consideration in this initiative is that locally 
produced pellets would compete with imported lucerne or 
concentrate pellets in terms of nutrient density and cost. 
Therefore, various pellet feed compositions were tested.

Formula 1 and formula 2, which have been formulated with faba 
beans or soy cakes as the source of protein, not only have a 
higher protein content than imported pellets, but they are less 
expensive. Formula 3 and 4 are suitable for livestock farmers in South Tunisia, where there are abundant dates. Date kernels and 
substandard dates can be valuable by using them to produce 
pellets. However, both these two formulas would need to be 
improved to increase protein content. 
Abdellah alters the ingredients and 
formulation of the pellets according to 
the nutrition needs of his animals. When 
fattening young sheep more rapidly four 
months before the Muslim holiday of Eid, he 
uses greater quantities of soybean or faba 
beans and maize in the pellets, containing 
15 - 20% protein. For young cattle grown 
for red meat, they are fed a combination of 
pellets containing 13-16% protein and hay 
and straw. 
As an owner of a large stock of ruminants, 
Abdellah can avail of subsidized barley grains 
(TND 0.52/kg). He is also a shareholder of 
an olive oil factory which gives him access 
to olive cakes, a by-product of olive oil 
production, at nearly no cost. His investment in the pellet machine is therefore enhanced 
by his access to low-cost feed material.
Abdellah’s daily requirement of feed 
pellets is about 525 kg (350 kg for 350 
sheep, plus 175 kg for 35 cows). To produce 
the weekly pellet requirement of 3.7 tons, 
he spends two half-days per week using his 
500 kg/hour pellet machine (TND 9,000/
USD 3,240). 
To develop a large-scale pellet production 
business, a machine capacity of at least 
3 tons per hour would be necessary. 
Although such a machine exists in China 
and could be imported to Tunisia, Abdellah 
says that obtaining a pellet production 
license from the government is a challenge.

CASE STUDY: saving costs and improving quality 
Abdellah Jajili is a livestock farmer in El Fahs, in central 
Tunisia, who owns 350 small ruminants and 35 cattle. He 
produces his own feed pellets from locally available material. 
He prefers the pellets because they are nearly half the price 
of feed concentrates from the shops and they are fresher than 
imported feed, which are sometimes old and rotten. Abdellah started out with a small pelleting machine with a 
capacity of 100 kg/hour then later purchased a larger one with 
a capacity of 500 kg/hour. 
The machines are produced in China and distributed by an 
importer who also provides spare parts and servicing.

handle/20.500.11766/6161) CONCLUSION: IMPLICATIONS  
AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The local production of feed pellets using machines has 
the potential to compete with expensive imported feed 
pellet concentrates. This initiative would be best suited 
to farmer cooperatives and large livestock farmers who 
have access to subsidized barley and wheat bran and 
agro-industrial by-products that can be valuable as feed 
ingredients. 
Feed pellets are easy to produce, stock, handle and 
ration.  The pellets reduce feed loss and turn what would 
otherwise be waste into valuable feed. However, the 
availability of by-products is essential to produce the 
pellets.

The solution proposed in this brief is part of a basket 
of solutions that can help livestock producers raise 
efficiencies and productivity. While there is the 
opportunity for more research, the feed pelleting 
business model can be considered a candidate model 
for scaling and be adapted into an integrated model 
for sustainable intensification of livestock production 
for smallholder farmers. For the local production of feed pellets to compete with 
imported concentrates, farmers would need access to subsidized 
ingredients and the reliable availability of agro-industrial by-
products. For this reason, this feed pellet manufacturing unit 
would be best suited to farmer cooperatives or large-scale 
farmers. In addition, ingredients or by-products necessary for 
feed pellets, like olive cakes and cactus fruit pulp, are typically 
only available during a certain period of the year, which reduces 
the production period. Access to wheat bran and barley grains, important parts of many 
feed block formulas (20 – 30%), is very difficult for small-scale 
producers. 
Another consideration is access to subsidized feed. 
Governmental distribution of subsidized wheat bran and barley 
caters to two groups: livestock farmers who obtain a certain 
amount of feed based on their number of animals, and large-
scale feed producers who must adhere to various regulations 
that are difficult for small-scale farmers enterprises to fulfil. CHALLENGES

Smallholders Income (Blog accessed via https://repo.mel.cgiar.org/
handle/20.500.11766/6161) CONCLUSION: IMPLICATIONS  
AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The local production of feed pellets using machines has 
the potential to compete with expensive imported feed 
pellet concentrates. This initiative would be best suited 
to farmer cooperatives and large livestock farmers who 
have access to subsidized barley and wheat bran and 
agro-industrial by-products that can be valuable as feed 
ingredients. 
Feed pellets are easy to produce, stock, handle and 
ration.  The pellets reduce feed loss and turn what would 
otherwise be waste into valuable feed. However, the 
availability of by-products is essential to produce the 
pellets.

The solution proposed in this brief is part of a basket 
of solutions that can help livestock producers raise 
efficiencies and productivity. While there is the 
opportunity for more research, the feed pelleting 
business model can be considered a candidate model 
for scaling and be adapted into an integrated model 
for sustainable intensification of livestock production 
for smallholder farmers. For the local production of feed pellets to compete with 
imported concentrates, farmers would need access to subsidized 
ingredients and the reliable availability of agro-industrial by-
products. For this reason, this feed pellet manufacturing unit 
would be best suited to farmer cooperatives or large-scale 
farmers. In addition, ingredients or by-products necessary for 
feed pellets, like olive cakes and cactus fruit pulp, are typically 
only available during a certain period of the year, which reduces 
the production period. Access to wheat bran and barley grains, important parts of many 
feed block formulas (20 – 30%), is very difficult for small-scale 
producers. 
Another consideration is access to subsidized feed. 
Governmental distribution of subsidized wheat bran and barley 
caters to two groups: livestock farmers who obtain a certain 
amount of feed based on their number of animals, and large-
scale feed producers who must adhere to various regulations 
that are difficult for small-scale farmers enterprises to fulfil. CHALLENGES

Use of such pellets also alleviates pressure on rangelands or grasslands.  This innovation consists of a small scale compressor 'pelletizer' and formulas to create qualitatively suﬃcient feed pellets with locally available inputs. In Tunisia, there are many agro-pastoralists that are dependent on expensive and imported livestock feed pellets to improve livestock quality and to supplement feed shortages. Risks of relative feed shortages are likely to increase due to climate change. Also there are many discarded by-products from local agro-food supply chains such as olive cakes, date kernels, and downgraded dates, which still contain nutrients. Feed pellet production with this small scale pelletizer producing 500 kg pellets / hour is also an interesting income generating activity for farmer organizations and creates employment.  ","364"

Mbili-Mbili (two maize rows alternating with two legume species) exploits plant spatial configurations to increase light penetration to the legumes, otherwise often shaded by cereals. The aim is to increase legume productivity while maintaining the same productivity of the cereal and taking advantage and complementarity of the different growth habits and durations of the combined crops. It enables farmers to grow both legumes and cereals on the same land and thus harvest at different times. In the event of a loss, one crop serves as insurance. This makes the system climate-smart. Mbili Mbili system has been reported to have a higher return (up to 37% more) compared to the standard farmer intercropping practices.

Excellence in 
Agronomy
The average season length in the Malawi – Mozambique – Zambia area for a wet year is 150 days but shortens to approximately 70 days in dry years. Seasons are typically longer in the 
Chinyanja Triangle, but there are generally more dry spells during El Niño years. 
 
Importantly, dry spells typically come earlier in the season in El Niño years, which is a cri�cal �me for soybean growth. Yield reduc�ons are therefore highly likely in El Niño years. 
Yield varies with variety dura�on: longer dura�on varie�es yield more than shorter dura�on varie�es almost always, and medium dura�on varie�es likely carry the least risk. 
Longer varie�es require early sowing, with plan�ng recommended before 23 Oct. If planted a�er this, a medium variety is likely to perform best, and can poten�ally yield at least as 
high. Short varie�es are only recommended in very late plan�ng or in the case of a season with very low rainfall, such as an El Niño year. 
There is likely to be varia�on within the Chinyanja region: earlier plan�ng (early to mid Oct) is recommended for all variety dura�ons in Angónia (Mozambique). Plan�ng should be 
postponed towards early to mid-November to maximize yield during dry (El Niño) years, par�cularly for short and medium varie�es in Kasungu (Malawi) and Katete (Zambia). 
To mi�gate risk of catastrophic loss of investment, consider (1) staggered plan�ng, (2) a mix of short and medium dura�on varie�es, (3) drought-tolerant varie�es – if available, 
or (4) a more drought-tolerant, shorter dura�on crop (mung bean, for instance).

average season length in a wet year is 150 days but shortens to 
approximately 70 days in dry years. However, seasons are typically 
longer in the north including in the Chinyanja Triangle  (as depicted by 
yellows and greens) - compared with the southern part (darker in color).  
Figure 2
Analysis of about 30 years of rainfall data indicates that the ﬁrst rains 
reach the Chinyanja Triangle in the ﬁrst half of October and increase in 
November. Dry spells are common, even in we�er than normal years 
and start to happen around December. There are generally more dry 
spells in the Chinyanja region during El Niño years, as indicated by the 
ﬂat red lines in A, and more clearly in B (El Niño of 1991-92) compared 
with C (non-El Niño of 2021-22). Importantly, the dry spells typically 
come earlier in the season in El Niño years, which is a cri�cal �me for 
soybean growth  (black line in A) and therefore likely to result in yield 
reduc�ons.

Yields for 3 soybean varie�es, 500 loca�ons, 20 plan�ng dates show 
that yield varies with variety dura�on for the three selected varie�es 
(880001-Short; 880002-Medium; 880004-Long), with medium and 
long dura�on varie�es yielding more than shorter dura�on varie�es 
across almost all years (A). However, these longer varie�es require 
early sowing. Long varie�es are preferable for plan�ng before 23 Oct 
(week 43), a�er which a medium variety performs best, and can 
poten�ally yield higher. Short varie�es are only recommended if 
plan�ng is late or in the case of a season with rainfall in the bo�om 
third (“low”, B).

for short, medium, and long soybean varie�esin dry and wet years. In 
each graph Angónia (MOZ, bo�om right) has a very dis�nct regime 
compared to the other two regions, requiring earlier plan�ng for all 
variety dura�ons. Plan�ng should be postponed towards early to 
mid-November to maximize yields during dry years, par�cularly for 
short and medium varie�es in Kasungu (MAL, top right) and Katete 
(ZAM, le�).  Median yields for the diﬀerent variety dura�ons in wet and 
dry years suggest that shorter dura�on varie�es perform best in dry 
years, such as El Niños, although yields are likely to be low.

In a previous Feed the Future project, Brachiaria was introduced and proved to be a suitable fodder. The Farakala multi stakeholder platform (MSP) was set up in 2016 to respond to challenges affecting the performance of the ruminant livestock value chain including shortage of feeds. Supported by ILRI, the MSP then organized the production of Brachiaria seeds by their members, and facilitated linkages with buyers. It also oversees the process. By the end of 2024, the value of sale of seeds was USD 77, 889, with USD 62,047 received during the SAPLING supported production campaigns.

Accelerated Breeding has developed tools and approaches for taking stock of current breeding pipelines and mapping them to a portfolio of distinct, achievable target product profiles (TPP’s) - each a unique combination of productivity, adaptation, resilience, quality, processing and consumer traits. By the end of 2023, CGIAR breeding programs have aligned close to 300 TPPs 1:1 to sub-regional market segments, using the Breeding Portal. Each TPP contains traits requirements and targeted scores. The value of these traits is captured through 14 value propositions that make breeding pipeline orientation towards Impact Areas transparent. The Breeding Portal defines which Breeding Pipeline and research team is pursuing each Target Product Profile, systematically orienting CGIAR breeding pipelines towards farmers’ needs, drivers of adoption, and impact. Together, the TPPs target over 300 million hectares grown by smallholders. Breeding Pipelines and Target Product Profiles pursued are made public through the Global Market Intelligence Platform (GloMIP).

Co-testing and demonstrating innovations in the region contributed to raising the demand for these crops and to the increasing engagement of private seeds companies to support the scaling of these innovations.  Dynamic public-private partnerships have been forged and catalyzed within the Agroecology Initiative, particularly between a private seed society (Cotugrain) and the National Agricultural Research Institute of Tunis (INRAT). This collaboration has created income diversification opportunities, with farmers contracted by the private sector and technically supported by the public development actor (OEP) to produce good quality forage base seeds, thus enhancing the sustainability of the adoption of these key strategic crops at regional and national levels.

Permanent link to cite or share this item https://hdl.handle.net/10568/134561 External link to download this item DOI Abstract/Description Small-scale livestock farmers in Central Tunisia are suffering from scarcity of feed resources and increasing feed prices. Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, prices for feed concentrates have significantly increased from about 350 $ / ton to almost 500 $ / ton. In addition, the extreme drought of the last agricultural season 2022-2023 has increased prices of other feed resources like straw and hay by 30% while milk prices, fixed by the Tunisian government, remain unchanged. This situation has reduced profitability of dairy farmers to such an extent that some farmers abandon milk production leading to milk shortage in the Tunisian markets.
An alternative feed resource that is less expensive than feed concentrates and important for increasing milk quality and quantity is silage. Silage is grass that has been 'pickled'. It is a method used  for conserving fresh grass, legumes, or green forage for ruminants. The grasses are cut, compacted, and stored and fermented in anaerobic conditions. Silage could therefore be an interesting option for dairy farmers to keep forage in good conditions for a long time and provide high-quality ruminant feed for increasing profitability.
The agroecology Initiative  in Tunisia has co-design technical innovations with farmers within an Agroecological Living Landscape (ALL). One of the actors of the ALL is a women farmer group in the village of Sers in central Tunisia. The group is composed of about 50 women engaged in livestock and dairy production. During participatory visioning exercises, the issue of reduced profitability of milk production has been raised by the farmers. ICARDA and its national partner organization OEP  (livestock and pasture office) proposed silage technology, which hasn’t been known by the farmers yet. The co-designed experiment showed an increase in milk production and income when dairy farmers are using silage as additional feed.

The challenge 
Reducing the impacts of climate change – such as drought, land degradation, and soil erosion – represents a major challenge 
for existing farming systems in Tunisia. It requires identifying and adopting new agricultural practices to enhance the resilience 
of agricultural production systems – and the question remains whether alternative agronomic practices can reduce soil 
erosion threats and preserve (or even improve) farm profitability compared to conventional practices. Farmers should be able 
to determine which actions or innovative practices may represent better alternatives, and it is important to provide them with 
the necessary evidence and guidance to make informed decisions that will benefit their livelihoods and the environment.POLICY BRIEF
Key messages
 Forage mixture crops are profitable alternatives to forage monocropping in cereal-based production systems of semi-
arid conditions, particularly under the rainfed agricultural production system.
 The “Vetch-Oat-Triticale” mixture offered the best net economic return and benefits relative to associated costs. 
 The intercropping system (forage mixtures between lines of olive trees) resulted in a net return and a benefit-cost 
ratio quite close to those of the open field cropping system.
 SWC practices, such as zero or minimum tillage and mechanical sowing, appear beneficial and cost-effective for 
farmers. 
 Farmers adopting forage seed production have better net returns and profits than those using green forage biomass 
or producing hay. 
 As applying forage mixtures and SWC practices can significantly contribute to reduce erosion problems and enhance 
farmers’ economic profitability, policymakers should promote these agricultural technologies in the study areas and 
scale them across similar agricultural production domains.
 The areas for potential out scaling of the “forage mixtures with intercropping” practice over semiarid rainfed 
cropland, and of the “forage mixtures” over semiarid rainfed cropland mixed with grasses practice are 1,895,400 ha 
and 2,340,000 ha, respectively.

POLICY BRIEF
This policy brief provides empirical evidence on the 
profitability of soil and water conservation (SWC) practices 
and forage mixtures, implemented to mitigate soil erosion 
and land degradation in Northern and Central West 
Tunisia. The practices and mixtures were realized through 
the SWC@Scale-ProSol  project, which aimed to ensure 
synergies between long-term goals of natural resource 
conservation and short-term objectives of farmers in terms 
of economic profit.
Introduction
Land degradation caused by soil erosion is a significant 
concern in Tunisia, with arid, semi-arid, and desert climates 
covering more than two-thirds of the country. In addition 
to land degradation, water scarcity is a major challenge in 
Tunisia, with relatively low precipitations characterized 
by high spatio-temporal variability, flooding, and uneven 
distribution (NIM, 2021). 
Tunisia faces a substantial risk of soil erosion. About 6.43% of 
its land area is affected by soil erosion, with the soil loss rate 
estimated at more than 30 t/ha/year (Serbaji et al., 2023). 
Kefi et al. (2012) reported that 3 million ha (60%) of Tunisia’s 
5 million ha of cultivated land is exposed to or affected by 
soil erosion. 
Consequently, the Tunisian government has invested in SWC 
practices through institutional and legislative measures. For instance, a national strategy for SWC and agricultural 
development has been in place since 1990, and over 600,000 
ha of land have benefited from conservation measures 
(Abouabdillah et al., 2014). SWC practices can increase crop 
production, food security, and household income, and various 
SWC technologies have been promoted among farmers to 
control soil erosion. 
Farmers’ decisions to invest in SWC technologies depend 
on their perception of the environmental, economic, and 
social impacts of these technologies. SWC practices offer 
environmental benefits, such as reducing soil erosion and 
improving water quality, which can boost agricultural 
productivity and reduce environmental degradation. 
However, adopting these technologies can be costly, with 
upfront investments and potential short-term economic 
losses due to changes in farming practices. Additionally, 
SWC technologies can have positive social impacts, such 
as contributing to rural development and food security by 
creating employment opportunities and improving food 
quality. Farmers should consider these factors before 
investing in SWC technologies (Huang et al., 2018).
The SWC@Scale-Prosol project aimed to research and design 
an affordable and scalable socio-technical package of SWC 
technologies to improve soil fertility in agroecosystems 
in the North West and Central West areas of Tunisia. The 
project’s activities were focused on two sites: Siliana District 
in Northwest Tunisia (for the cereal-based farming system) 
and Kairouan District in Central West Tunisia (for the olive-

POLICY BRIEF
livestock farming system). The interventions involved a 
set of SWC practices and forage mixture crops suitable 
and appropriate to existing production systems: i) forage 
mixtures in the rotation of the cereal-based system; ii) better 
integration of tree crops and livestock in the olive-based 
farming systems (intercropping), using forage combinations 
used for livestock production; and iii) SWC practices, such as 
no-till or minimal soil disturbance, to help restore soil health 
and fertility at farm and landscape levels.
Methodology
Study areas and data 
A survey was conducted in Rhahla (Siliana) and El Khol 
(Kairouan), with the Rhahla site under rainfed conditions and 
El Khol under irrigated. Farm activities, including quantities, 
costs, and returns, were recorded per hectare. Thirty-three 
farmers were surveyed, revealing the most used practices 
during the cropping season (2021-2022) to be intercropping 
(60%) and mechanical sowing (62%). Sixteen farmers tested 
the Vetch-Oat (VO) mixture, five the Vetch-Triticale (VT), 
six the Vetch-Oat-Triticale (VOT), and five the Vetch-Oat-
Triticale-Fenugreek (VOTF). More details about the survey 
can be found in Souissi et al. (2023).
The costs and benefits of crop production systems were 
categorized for cost-benefit analysis of grain yield and 
biomass production of the forage mixtures (VO, VT, VOT, 
and VOTF). The main categories of costs were: total land 
preparation costs; sowing costs; growing costs; harvest, 
transportation, and processing costs; and variable production 
costs. Benefits were calculated based on the market prices 
paid for the forage mixtures of grain, straw, and hay products 
in both regions. For the cost-benefit analysis, fertilizers, 
pesticides, and irrigation costs were included into the 
growing costs category. Labor, machinery, and diesel costs 
were recorded for all cropping activities. For the income 
assessment, market prices were considered for each product, 
as farmers’ agricultural production is mainly used to feed 
their livestock.Analytical tools
Economic and financial tools were used to evaluate the 
profitability of SWC practices and forage mixture cropping 
in different agroecosystems. These analytical tools can help 
determine whether the implemented agricultural practices 
may increase farmers’ net income or reduce their total 
variable production costs. 
We apply the partial budget analysis (marginal analysis) 
for the economic evaluation. This analysis compares the 
costs and returns as affected by a potential change through 
the intervention technologies or practices,  and is used to 
evaluate budgets that involve small, specific, and limited 
action changes. To help determine the profitability of a 
change, the analysis uses a set of measurable indicators, such 
as the benefit-cost ratio (BCR). The BCR looks at the relative 
values of the benefits and costs when the profits from two 
considered alternatives (with and without technology) appear 
to be the same. Using the BCR can help a farmer determine 
which technology option would produce better returns, and if 
it is worth adopting the new technology or improved farming 
practice. Both net change in profits and the BCR should be 
applied to a partial budge analysis, to evaluate the results and 
assess the economic profitability of agricultural innovations/
technologies/practices.
Key findings
The forage mixture crops (VO, VT, VOT, and VOTF) were 
profitable to farmers under different agroecosystems in 
the study areas of Northwest and Central West areas of 
Tunisia. The overall BCRs are between 2.74 and 3.03, higher 
than the minimum decision-making benchmark (of 1). The 
partial budget analysis shows that VOT mixture is the most 
profitable compared to other forage mixtures tested (Table 1).
The rainfed system in Rhahla resulted in higher net returns 
and BCR compared to the irrigated cropping system in El 
Khol (Table 2). Farmers in El Khol used the production as 
hay for livestock feeding, while few farmers harvested cereal 
seeds. On the other hand, many farmers in Rhahla opted for 
seed harvesting. It was observed that variable production 
costs were comparable for both seed and hay producers 
(Souissi et al., 2023), but the generated revenues were 
significantly higher for seed production plots (Table 2). 
The cost-benefit analysis shows that seed production 
enhances farmers’ income and ensures seed availability, 
reducing dependency on the unstable international market. 
SWC practices, such as zero/minimum tillage (no-till/less 
than two shallow tillage (less than 15 cm), offered a higher 
BCR than the conventional practices (more than two tillage 
by season) (Table 3).

However, the net return was lower due to reduced yields. 
The partial budget analysis indicates that reducing the 
number of ploughings may save costs but could lead to lower 
yields. These results highlight the importance of balancing 
the benefits and drawbacks of no-tillage or minimum-tillage 
practices regarding yields and costs. While SWC practices can result in a higher BCR, farmers should consider the 
potential yield decrease before adoption. Currently, no-
tillage (or minimum tillage) is gaining popularity due to its soil 
conservation benefits. However, a cost-benefit analysis using 
partial budget analysis suggests that conventional tillage 
may be more profitable (in the short term) in some cases. It is Table 1. Cost-benefit and partial budget analysis of different forage mixture crops.

important to note that, although non-market values related 
to reduced tillage and soil conservation are unaccounted 
for in this analysis, tillage reduction can contribute to soil 
erosion reduction, moisture conservation in dry areas, and 
microbial growth.
The BCR analysis indicates that both open field and 
intercropping cropping systems are profitable. However, 
the plots involving the intercropping of forage mixtures 
between the lines of olive trees have a slightly lower BCR of 2.57 compared to the open field system of 2.98 (Table 4). 
While intercropping may not be the most profitable option, 
it can still diversify revenue and maximize profit in different 
agricultural contexts.
The types of tillage practices also matter in the economic 
evaluation (Table 5). Deep tillage involves plowing or 
subsoiling to a depth exceeding 25 cm and is used to loosen 
compacted soil, improve soil structure, and increase crop 
yields. However, deep tillage can negatively affect soil’s

The study also identified scalable areas having the same 
socio-ecological context as the project contextual setting 
at the sites where forage mixtures cropping was profitable 
and well-perceived performing as agronomic soil-water 
conservation technology. These mapped areas can serve as 
geographical recommendation domains for supporting out-
scaling efforts of forage mixture cropping (Figure 1).
Concluding remarks, recommendations, and 
strategic actions
The SWC practices and forage mixtures cropping are 
promising strategies to reduce soil erosion rates and 
improve soil health and water retention capacity. They 
can help mitigate the impacts of drought in dryland areas, 
such as Tunisia’s arid region. Further, farmers can adopt 
such sustainable land management practices to protect 
the environment and improve their livelihoods. Adapting 
proven principles and practices of conservation agriculture, 
including crop diversification and crop rotations are also 
recommended to upscale conservation agriculture in crop-
livestock farming systems. It should be noted that although intercropping (using forage mixtures with olive trees) is 
cost-effective and profitable, additional comprehensive 
research is required to ascertain the optimal techniques 
for irrigation, harvest stage, and other cultural factors. 
Moreover, further research is needed to understand 
the economic and environmental implications of tillage 
practices by including their non-market values.
Policy support is needed for a productive, sustainable, and 
climate-resilient crop-livestock system using conservation 
agriculture practices, adequate forage mixtures and 
rotation. Policy makers should use the mapped areas 
identified in the study as geographically recommended 
areas to support out-scaling efforts of forage mixture 
cropping. They can organize and support capacity 
development activities and trainings via the extension 
services to disseminate and improve farmers’ knowledge 
of SWC practices and forage mixtures intercropping. 
Multiplying and diffusing forage mixtures seeds is also 
needed to sustain the project interventions.
Policy makers should promote and support the adoption 
of SWC practices and forage mixture cropping to ensure 
sustainable agriculture and climate change adaptation. 
It requires cooperating with the Consultative Group of

The challenge 
Reducing the impacts of climate change – such as drought, land degradation, and soil erosion – represents a major challenge 
for existing farming systems in Tunisia. It requires identifying and adopting new agricultural practices to enhance the resilience 
of agricultural production systems – and the question remains whether alternative agronomic practices can reduce soil 
erosion threats and preserve (or even improve) farm profitability compared to conventional practices. Farmers should be able 
to determine which actions or innovative practices may represent better alternatives, and it is important to provide them with 
the necessary evidence and guidance to make informed decisions that will benefit their livelihoods and the environment.POLICY BRIEF
Key messages
 Forage mixture crops are profitable alternatives to forage monocropping in cereal-based production systems of semi-
arid conditions, particularly under the rainfed agricultural production system.
 The “Vetch-Oat-Triticale” mixture offered the best net economic return and benefits relative to associated costs. 
 The intercropping system (forage mixtures between lines of olive trees) resulted in a net return and a benefit-cost 
ratio quite close to those of the open field cropping system.
 SWC practices, such as zero or minimum tillage and mechanical sowing, appear beneficial and cost-effective for 
farmers. 
 Farmers adopting forage seed production have better net returns and profits than those using green forage biomass 
or producing hay. 
 As applying forage mixtures and SWC practices can significantly contribute to reduce erosion problems and enhance 
farmers’ economic profitability, policymakers should promote these agricultural technologies in the study areas and 
scale them across similar agricultural production domains.
 The areas for potential out scaling of the “forage mixtures with intercropping” practice over semiarid rainfed 
cropland, and of the “forage mixtures” over semiarid rainfed cropland mixed with grasses practice are 1,895,400 ha 
and 2,340,000 ha, respectively.

POLICY BRIEF
This policy brief provides empirical evidence on the 
profitability of soil and water conservation (SWC) practices 
and forage mixtures, implemented to mitigate soil erosion 
and land degradation in Northern and Central West 
Tunisia. The practices and mixtures were realized through 
the SWC@Scale-ProSol  project, which aimed to ensure 
synergies between long-term goals of natural resource 
conservation and short-term objectives of farmers in terms 
of economic profit.
Introduction
Land degradation caused by soil erosion is a significant 
concern in Tunisia, with arid, semi-arid, and desert climates 
covering more than two-thirds of the country. In addition 
to land degradation, water scarcity is a major challenge in 
Tunisia, with relatively low precipitations characterized 
by high spatio-temporal variability, flooding, and uneven 
distribution (NIM, 2021). 
Tunisia faces a substantial risk of soil erosion. About 6.43% of 
its land area is affected by soil erosion, with the soil loss rate 
estimated at more than 30 t/ha/year (Serbaji et al., 2023). 
Kefi et al. (2012) reported that 3 million ha (60%) of Tunisia’s 
5 million ha of cultivated land is exposed to or affected by 
soil erosion. 
Consequently, the Tunisian government has invested in SWC 
practices through institutional and legislative measures. For instance, a national strategy for SWC and agricultural 
development has been in place since 1990, and over 600,000 
ha of land have benefited from conservation measures 
(Abouabdillah et al., 2014). SWC practices can increase crop 
production, food security, and household income, and various 
SWC technologies have been promoted among farmers to 
control soil erosion. 
Farmers’ decisions to invest in SWC technologies depend 
on their perception of the environmental, economic, and 
social impacts of these technologies. SWC practices offer 
environmental benefits, such as reducing soil erosion and 
improving water quality, which can boost agricultural 
productivity and reduce environmental degradation. 
However, adopting these technologies can be costly, with 
upfront investments and potential short-term economic 
losses due to changes in farming practices. Additionally, 
SWC technologies can have positive social impacts, such 
as contributing to rural development and food security by 
creating employment opportunities and improving food 
quality. Farmers should consider these factors before 
investing in SWC technologies (Huang et al., 2018).
The SWC@Scale-Prosol project aimed to research and design 
an affordable and scalable socio-technical package of SWC 
technologies to improve soil fertility in agroecosystems 
in the North West and Central West areas of Tunisia. The 
project’s activities were focused on two sites: Siliana District 
in Northwest Tunisia (for the cereal-based farming system) 
and Kairouan District in Central West Tunisia (for the olive-

livestock farming system). The interventions involved a 
set of SWC practices and forage mixture crops suitable 
and appropriate to existing production systems: i) forage 
mixtures in the rotation of the cereal-based system; ii) better 
integration of tree crops and livestock in the olive-based 
farming systems (intercropping), using forage combinations 
used for livestock production; and iii) SWC practices, such as 
no-till or minimal soil disturbance, to help restore soil health 
and fertility at farm and landscape levels.
Methodology
Study areas and data 
A survey was conducted in Rhahla (Siliana) and El Khol 
(Kairouan), with the Rhahla site under rainfed conditions and 
El Khol under irrigated. Farm activities, including quantities, 
costs, and returns, were recorded per hectare. Thirty-three 
farmers were surveyed, revealing the most used practices 
during the cropping season (2021-2022) to be intercropping 
(60%) and mechanical sowing (62%). Sixteen farmers tested 
the Vetch-Oat (VO) mixture, five the Vetch-Triticale (VT), 
six the Vetch-Oat-Triticale (VOT), and five the Vetch-Oat-
Triticale-Fenugreek (VOTF). More details about the survey 
can be found in Souissi et al. (2023).
The costs and benefits of crop production systems were 
categorized for cost-benefit analysis of grain yield and 
biomass production of the forage mixtures (VO, VT, VOT, 
and VOTF). The main categories of costs were: total land 
preparation costs; sowing costs; growing costs; harvest, 
transportation, and processing costs; and variable production 
costs. Benefits were calculated based on the market prices 
paid for the forage mixtures of grain, straw, and hay products 
in both regions. For the cost-benefit analysis, fertilizers, 
pesticides, and irrigation costs were included into the 
growing costs category. Labor, machinery, and diesel costs 
were recorded for all cropping activities. For the income 
assessment, market prices were considered for each product, 
as farmers’ agricultural production is mainly used to feed 
their livestock.Analytical tools
Economic and financial tools were used to evaluate the 
profitability of SWC practices and forage mixture cropping 
in different agroecosystems. These analytical tools can help 
determine whether the implemented agricultural practices 
may increase farmers’ net income or reduce their total 
variable production costs. 
We apply the partial budget analysis (marginal analysis) 
for the economic evaluation. This analysis compares the 
costs and returns as affected by a potential change through 
the intervention technologies or practices,  and is used to 
evaluate budgets that involve small, specific, and limited 
action changes. To help determine ","12034"

Training of smallholder farmers and livestock experts on improved chicken management practices at SAPLING sites in Ethiopia. Nairobi, Kenya: International Livestock Research Institute.      About SAPLING CGIAR’s Sustainable Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender inclusion (SAPLING) is working in seven countries focusing on livestock value chains to package and scale out tried-and-tested, as well as new, innovations in livestock health, genetics, feed and market systems. SAPLING aims to demonstrate that improvements in livestock productivity can offer a triple win: generating improved livelihoods and nutritional outcomes; contributing to women’s empowerment; and reducing impacts on climate and the environment. Its seven focus countries are Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Nepal, Tanzania, Uganda and Vietnam.  Acknowledgements This work was conducted as part of the CGIAR Initiative on Sustainable Animal Productivity. CGIAR research is supported by contributions to the CGIAR Trust Fund. CGIAR is a global research partnership for a food-secure future dedicated to transforming food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis.

 2 Background to training  The aim of CGIAR’s Sustainable Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender inclusion (SAPLING) chicken value chain activities in Ethiopia is to test and avail high-producing, farmer-preferred chicken genotypes to enhance smallholder chicken productivity (in terms of eggs and meat yield). Three genetically improved candidate chicken strains (Sasso, Koekoek and Bovans Brown) have been identified for performance evaluation and scaling under on-farm conditions. The TPGS team at ILRI, agricultural research institutions, and bureaus in Amhara, Oromia, South Ethiopia, and Central Ethiopia regions have partnered to implement these activities. Doyogena performance testing site (PTS) falls in the Central Ethiopia Region, while another PTS at Konso falls within South Ethiopia Region. The two PTSs in Amhara Region are located at Bahir Dar Zuria and Menz Gera. Within Oromia Region, the SAPLING chicken interventions are implemented at Welmera and Berek. In total, SAPLING chicken value chain activities are being implemented in six districts across four regions of Ethiopia.   Target farmers lack the skills needed to keep improved chicken strains and desired levels of productivity and positive changes on livelihoods cannot be achieved unless they receive training prior to project intervention.  The trainings organized for farmers and reported in this document are linked with planned activities of SAPLING in work package (WP)1 — Technologies and practices for sustainable livestock productivity and WP4 — Competitive and inclusive livestock value chains; and WP5 — Evidence, decisions, and scaling.  In WP1, they contribute to identification and promotion of productive and tropically-adapted chicken breeds and help integrate genetics with flock health and feeds. Regarding to WP4, key stakeholders and value chain actors were invited, and opportunities and challenges discussed at community level. Discussions were held with value chain actors as a preliminary step to the scaling process. Training on type of breeds that will be disseminated to farmers and their production requirements, improved chicken housing construction and management, improved feed formulation and feeding practices, chicken health management and market linkages was given to on-farm participating farmers in each PTS. Location and modality Selected participants from the four regions of Ethiopia attended the trainings. The participants included district livestock extension and chicken health experts, community leaders, input supplies and service providers, and village administration. Each performance testing site comprised participants from three SAPLING villages (kebeles). The trainings were provided face-to-face. They targeted farmers who take part in on-farm chicken performance testing of improved breeds, and the livestock experts who provide them support services in the project areas. In total 984 participants, including 700 farmers from 6 SAPLING PTSs (constituting 18 target villages) attended the training. Dates of trainings The trainings were organized at different times across performance testing sites in the four regions. In Amhara Region, the trainings were provided between 24–26 February at Menz Gera; and 7–9 March at Bahir Dar Zuria in the year 2023. In Oromia Region, the trainings were provided between 27 April and 30 May at Welmera; and 30 April and 5 May at Berek. In Central Ethiopia Region, the training was provided between 26 and 30 March 2023 at Doyogena. In South Ethiopia, the training was conducted between 21 and 24 May 2023 at Konso.

 3 Who conducted the training The training was given by researchers from the national research system and chicken experts at district offices of agriculture. Partnering institutions included Andassa Livestock Research Centre (ALRC) of the Amhara Region Agricultural Research Institute (ARARI), Holetta Agricultural Research Centre (HARC) of Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR), and Arba Minch and Areka Agricultural Research Centres of Southern Agricultural Research Institute (SARI). Objectives of the training The objectives of these trainings were to build the capacity of smallholder farmers on improved chicken management and production practices and to engage chicken value chain actors. Training agenda  Training of farmers and agricultural experts The trainings aimed at improving the knowledge of farmers on improved chicken husbandry and creating awareness to key chicken value chain actors in program intervention areas about planned chicken interventions. The value chain actors received orientation about SAPLING activities.   The training agendas included the design of the on-farm chicken performance test and expectations from key actors, chicken breeding, feeding, health and housing. After training the participant farmers acquired the skill needed to construct new chicken houses or renovate existing ones and learned how to formulate feeds from locally available resources to supplement their chickens. The chicken health training focused on hygienic practices and ways to prevent diseases.   The content of the training is presented below.  • Chicken housing: design, construction of walls and floor, ventilation, equipment to be fulfilled in the chicken house (e.g., feeders, waterers, laying nest), protection of chickens from predators. • Chicken feeds and feeding management: feed formulation from locally available resources, nutrient requirements for growth and egg production, managing costs. • Chicken health: biosecurity, prevention, and control of diseases. • Participating in SAPLING chicken interventions: design of the present research and development intervention, selection of sites and farmers, roles and responsibilities of actors (farmers, enumerators, agricultural experts, researchers), linkage with input and service providers.  Training of farmers and agricultural experts in Amhara Region Farmers, livestock experts, input, and support service providers from Bahir Dar Zuria and Menz Gera districts (chicken performance testing sites) of Amhara Region attended the training organized at their respective districts.   A total of 432 farmers, 6 kebele administrators, 12 kebele livestock experts , 6 kebele animal health experts, 10 district livestock officers (process owners, breeding experts, feed and nutrition experts and health experts), 2 district agricultural and rural development officers, and 6 enumerators participated in the training. From the total participants 46.6% of them were females (Table 1).

Resilience Amidst Adversity: A Ground Truthing 
Analysis of Climate, Livelihood, and Conflict in the 
Turkana and West Pokot Regions of Kenya  
The Karamoja -Turkana/Pokot -Eastern Equatoria -SNNPR Region is found in the heart of the horn of Africa and 
traverses four countries. The region is predominately arid and semi -arid (ASAL), with high temperatures (16.7°C - 
40°C) and low rainfall (188 mm - 1200 mm) on average annually. More than 70% of the inhabitants of this region live 
in absolute poverty. The region being a transboundary cluster, there exists mobility of nomadic communities across 
borders and share common natural resources, exchange of cultu re and intermarry. The effects of climate change 
are expected to be particularly pronounced in the horn of Africa, where rising temperatures, unpredictable 
anomalous rainfall and high vulnerability to extreme natural hazards will continue to affect livelih oods and 
exacerbate human conflict and harm local and regional human, economic, and environmental security. Based on 
this, a situational analysis of the region was carried out to get a better understanding the baselines, and the extent 
of the challenge in the region with an aim of developing sustainable projects/programs, based on a multi -
stakeholder approach that will intrinsically tackle the main issues surrounding, livelihoods, economic development 
and conflicts.  
One of the main purposes of this trip was a ground -truthing mission to collect primary data that supports the findings 
of the situational analysis of the region based on desk review. The data collection methods used to collect primary 
data included observa tion and interviews. The ground truthing mission was conducted for 6 days coverings West 
Pokot and Turkana counties (Kenya). The trip included West Pokot County towns like Morkwijit, Kapenguria, 
Chepareria, Sebit, Ortum and Orwa; Turkana county towns inclu ded Kainuk, Kakongu, Kalemngorok, Lokichar, 
Changamatak and Lodwar. Observations were made throughout the mission from Kapenguria through to Lodwar, 
and interviews (Unstructured) with county officials and locals were made only in Kapenguria and Lodwar (the  capital 
of the two counties). The focus of the ground truthing study was based on the following topics: Climate profile, 
Livelihood profile, climate risks, gender relations, refugee relations and conflict.  
Findings  
1. Climate profile  
There was a clear transition from a semi -arid climate with a number of green zones towards a more arid and drier 
climate, as we moved through Morkwijit through Kapenguria towards Kainuk (Border town between West Pokot and 
Turkana Country). The transition w as marked by a change in temperatures (temperatures increased as we went on), 
and a change in vegetation (From green grass, trees and farms to scares trees and shrubs). The transition from 
Kainuk to Lodwar was largely steep, moving from a highland and hill y range of Orwa to relatively flat lowlands. The 
temperatures peaked at about 36 °C in Lodwar. Regarding vegetation, the transition was largely uniform with 
patches of shrubs dominated by bare land.

Figure 1: Shrubs and thatches along Kainuk and Lodwar Road  
These findings align with the climate profile based on the desk review. However, there were more green zones 
(zones that support agriculture) in the highland region of West Pokot than previously anticipated. From observation, 
West Pokot is better primed fo r agricultural interventions. For Turkana County, the desk review showed the 
possibility of green zones especially along river Turkwel, however, due to the prolonged drought in the county very 
few of these zones exist.  
2. Livelihood profile and Gender  
 
Figure 2: West Pokot woman selling stone 
crafts   
Figure 3: Cattle (Including camels) kept in Turkana  
In most parts of West Pokot County which is predominantly Semi -Arid the primary source of livelihood is agro -
pastoralism. The county has greater potential for agriculture with pastoralism also being a key livelihood activity. 
There  are a number of alternative livelihood activities within West Pokot, this includes sand mining, trading, poultry, 
beekeeping, and stone craftsmanship. Tourism was suggested as a possible alternative livelihood source because 
of the number of nature sites including a number of forests for bird viewing.  
Page 5:
In Turkana, The  major livelihood activity is pastoralism, which includes herding cattle, goats, and camels among 
others. Alternative sources of income include trading (especially in city centres), beekeeping, fishing and irrigation 
farming. Most irrigation projects are s truggling because of the prolonged droughts in the region and importantly 
the drying up of River Turkwel, which is the main source of water for these farms.  
 
Figure 4: Fishing along the shores of Lake 
Turkana   
Figure 5: Fish drying along the shores of Lake 
Turkana  
Women's participation in livelihoods was evident in both counties, particularly alternative sources of income such 
as agriculture, trading, and crafting, in the fishing supply chain (fishing, drying and selling of fish and fish products). 
Important to note  is most capital to start these alternative incomes is provided by the men. Women are more often 
involved in decision -making at the household level and are becoming providers alongside the men. Therefore with 
regards to livelihoods, the primary information  we received while undertaking the ground truthing process reflects 
the findings on the desk review situational analysis. With regard to gender analysis, the desk review underestimated

3. Climate risks and movement  
The climate profile of the region is consistent with the secondary data collected during the situational analysis. The 
climatic risks that arise from the climate conditions include prolonged droughts (approaching 5 seasons which is 
about 2 years without ra in), flash floods and landslides especially in the highland regions of West Pokot are 
prevalent. Drought is the main climate risk within the two counties, this has created water and pasture scarcity and 
has led to frequent mobility in search of water and p asture. This mobility especially between west Pokot and Turkana 
has led to armed conflict that has resulted in killings, especially between the borders of Turkana and West Pokot 
counties. An example of this happened while we were in Turkana, where we got a  report of a raid allegedly by West 
Pokot in Turkana leading to deaths. It is therefore evident that the changing climate is, directly and indirectly, leading 
to conflict in this region.

Figure 6: Shrubs and thatches along Kainuk and 
Lodwar Road   
Figure 7: The drying river Turkwel  
The climate risk and conflict analysis in the situational analysis is consistent with the findings on the ground. However, 
the analysis doesn’t emphasize the extent of the raiding. Firstly, most movement of pastoralists is towards Uganda, 
this is consisten t with the finds during our desk review. Additionally, Contrary to our findings, there is the movement 
of pastoralists following inter -county routes between West Pokot and Turkana. Therefore conflicts as a result of 
pressures on natural resources (driven b y climate change) were underestimated in the desk review. The reality 
being, there is as much conflict between the counties as compared to between countries (Kenya, Uganda, S. Sudan 
and Ethiopia). One thing that is evident is that pastoralists have been fo rced to move further and more frequently 
not only on the traditional route they have been taking but also taking new routes in search of water and pasture 
resources.  
4. Conclusion  
The findings collected during the ground truthing activity largely underpin and support the analysis in the desk 
review report. However, it is important to note that there exist complexities and a deeper extent of the ongoing 
climate change risks in West P okot and Turkana. The design of sustainable projects within this region will require a 
further in -depth problem analysis before recommending solutions. One way this can be achieved is through multi -
stakeholder involvement throughout project development and  execution.

 yFarmers in the Mai Son district are increasingly 
embracing novel forage varieties, such as Green 
Elephant grass and legumes. Notably, Green 
Elephant grass is favored for its adaptability to the 
local climate, substantial biomass production, and 
positive impact on animal productivity. This adoption 
proves instrumental in fulfilling the growing demand 
for animal feed.
 yKey obstacles hindering widespread adoption revolve 
around limited access to training, information, and 
financial resources for investments. The challenges 
are particularly acute in remote and mountainous 
areas, with Hmong women experiencing additional 
hurdles due to language barriers. Efforts to 
address these barriers are crucial for fostering 
comprehensive adoption of beneficial forage 
technologies in the region.Georgina Smith/ CIAT
KEY MESSAGESCONTEXT
Livestock systems in Vietnam are increasingly moving 
towards intensification (Ba et al., 2012). Livestock production 
in the Northwest Highlands of Vietnam plays a crucial role 
in supporting the livelihoods of small producers and ethnic 
minorities (Tiemann, 2019). However, farmers in this region 
encounter various challenges in fulfilling the demand for 
livestock feed. Common issues include feed shortages, 
particularly during the winter season (December-April), low 
nutritional quality of the feed basket, meager forage yield, 
and labor-intensive forage-gathering practices (Hammond 
et al., 2021; Atieno et al., 2021a; Tran et al., 2023). To address 
these challenges, the government and other stakeholders 
are advocating for a modernization agenda in livestock 
production. This agenda focuses on diversifying and 
enhancing the nutritional quality of the animals' feed basket. 
Key strategies involve the dissemination of forage varieties 
that are nutritionally advantageous and help ensuring a 
consistent availability of feed throughout the year.
Aligned with these initiatives, the CGIAR Research Program 
on Livestock, under the Li-Chan Project, actively facilitated 
capacity building in animal nutrition and the dissemination 
of improved forage varieties, including both grasses and 
legumes. This effort yielded positive outcomes in terms of 
enhanced productivity, effectively addressing the challenges 
Page 2:

| POLICY BRIEFin livestock nutritional management within the Mai Son district 
of Son La province (Atieno et al., 2021a, 2021b).
Building on these achievements and as part of the OneCGIAR 
Initiative SAPLING, this study seeks to discern the preferences 
among the forage varieties promoted over the past five years. 
Additionally, it aims to identify factors that either encourage 
or discourage their adoption. This groundwork is essential 
for the subsequent expansion of these interventions to 
other regions in Vietnam. To achieve this objective, we have 
opted for a qualitative approach, employing semi-structured 
interviews conducted with both adopting and non-adopting 
producers, encompassing men and women in the Chieng 
Luong and Chieng Chung communes of the Mai Son District.
METHODS AND DATA
Employing a qualitative methodology facilitated a 
comprehensive exploration of factors influencing the adoption 
of forage technologies (FT). The evaluated FTs encompassed 
Urochloa  hybrid cv. Mulato II (Mulato II), Megathyrsus maximus  
cv. Mombasa (Mombasa guinea), Pennisetum purpureum  (Green 
Elephant), Paspalum atratym  (Ubon paspalum), Stylosanthes 
guianensis  cv. Vulgaris x cv. Paucifloa (Ubon Stylo), Arachis 
pintoi  (Pinto peanut), and Vigna umbellata  (rice bean). The 
research, conducted by enumerators from the Northern 
Mountainous Agriculture & Forestry Science Institute 
(NOMAFSI), involved 42 semi-structured interviews with both 
adopters and non-adopters across six villages in Chieng Luong 
and Chieng Chung communes within the Mai Son district. A purposive sampling method was employed to ensure 
representation of both women and men farmers. Additionally, 
the socio-geographic typologies utilized in prior studies 
were maintained, distinguishing four farming systems and 
considering ethnic composition across three geographic 
systems: valley areas, mid-level, and highland areas (Tiemann, 
2019; Hammond et al., 2021) (see Figure 1). We selected 
farmers who have embraced a minimum of one type of FT, 
with a particular focus on those advocated by the Li-Chan 
project. Our interviews aimed to pinpoint the specific species 
they have integrated, understand the primary motivations 
behind their adoption, explore the perceived benefits they 
have encountered, and identify the hurdles encountered 
throughout the adoption process. The interviews, conducted 
in Vietnamese in May 2023, were subsequently translated into 
English. Data analysis was conducted utilizing the content 
analysis method. The categories of analysis included in the 
tool encompassed 1) knowledge of the FT and 2) benefits and 
challenges associated with adoption.
RESULTS
Adoption of forages technologies
The predominant forage varieties adopted in the region 
include Green Elephant grass and Mombasa guinea, with 
Pinto peanut, Rice bean, Mulato II, and Ubon Stylo also seeing 
adoption, albeit to a lesser extent. Green Elephant grass 
emerges as the most favored variety across all types of farms, 
commonly utilized by both men and women.

Embracing Forage Technologies in Mai Son District, Son La Province, VietnamIn farms categorized as Type A and C2, farmers are primarily 
influenced by the Li-Chan project and recommendations 
from fellow farmers who have successfully implemented 
forage technologies. Conversely, in Type B and C1 farms, 
diversifying feed sources, experimenting with new varieties, 
and increasing biomass production are the predominant 
motivations for adoption. Regarding gender differences in FT 
adoption, women often rely on expert recommendations, such 
as those from the Li-Chan project and neighboring farmers. 
In contrast, men emphasize the significance of augmenting 
biomass production. Farmers have recognized various benefits stemming from the 
implementation of these FT. The foremost advantages include 
reduced labor costs, attributed to the low maintenance 
requirements of these varieties, and increased animal 
productivity. Women particularly highlight the convenience 
of having forage plant areas closer to their homes, facilitating 
seamless integration with household labor. Farmers in Type 
C1 and C2 farms appreciate the ease of cutting these forage 
technologies without posing harm during harvesting. Table 1 
gives a comprehensive overview of the benefits of adoption 
identified by the interviewees.

| POLICY BRIEFBarriers to adoption 
Farmers who have adopted forage technologies encountered 
diverse barriers and challenges, leading to the discontinuation 
of some previously adopted varieties. Notably, Pinto peanut, 
rice bean, and Ubon Stylo are among the most underutilized 
varieties, primarily due to their low performance and poor 
adaptability to cool winters.
Access to training for the effective management of forage 
technologies is identified as crucial, but not all farmers 
have had the opportunity to benefit from it. Farms located 
closer to the market (Type As and B), exhibit greater access 
to training compared to more distant farm Types C1 and C2. 
Furthermore, there is a gender disparity, with men having 
more access to training than women. Training initiatives have 
been provided by the Li-Chan project, veterinarians, and non-
governmental organizations. Similar challenges are observed 
in terms of access to information, particularly on farms 
situated in remote and mountainous areas (Type C1 and C2). 
All farmers interviewed from these areas express difficulties 
in accessing information, with Hmong women facing more 
significant challenges than men, including language barriers 
such as not speaking and reading Vietnamese. The internet 
and handouts serve as the primary sources of information for 
these farmers.
Financial constraints and limited access to credit pose 
challenges for farmers. In farm Types A, B, and C1, farmers 
predominantly finance livestock activities using their savings. 
On the Type C2 farms, which are further away from the market, 
there is a prevalent fear among farmers of being unable to 
repay loans. Table 2 provides an overview of the barriers to 
adoption derived from interviewed farmers.
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the identification of adoption conditions and 
key barriers faced by farmers in the region, the following 
recommendations are proposed to enhance the adoption levels 
of forage technologies:
 yPromote Green Elephant grass: Given that Green Elephant 
grass is the preferred variety among farmers in the region 
and has demonstrated positive results, ongoing promotion 
and adoption efforts should be continued.
 yAddress challenges with Pinto peanut, rice bean, and 
Ubon Stylo:  Recognizing the difficulties farmers face 
in adopting Pinto peanut, rice bean, and Ubon Stylo, 
focused efforts should be directed towards improving the 
performance and adaptability of these varieties, especially 
in cool winter conditions. ySustain Li-Chan project activities:  The Li-Chan project 
has played a significant role in motivating farmers to adopt 
forage technologies. It is essential for the project to persist 
in its activities to further boost adoption levels in the region, 
i.e., through the OneCGIAR SAPLING initiative.
 yEnhance training and information access in remote 
farms: Develop strategies to extend training and 
information access to farms located further away from 
the market. Potential initiatives may involve collaborations 
between research centers and rural extension programs. 
Additionally, a gender-inclusive approach should be 
integrated into these strategies to address the existing 
disparity in training and information access between men 
and women.
 yMitigate fear of financing in remote farms: Recognize 
the fear among farmers in remote farms about seeking 
financing. Implement measures to create favorable 
and easy payment conditions, encouraging farmers to 
confidently request credit for financing their livestock 
activities.
By implementing these recommendations, there is a prospect 
of overcoming existing barriers and fostering a more 
widespread and successful adoption of forage technologies 
in the region.

The show has been broadcasting content on good agricultural practices for many farming systems in Kenya for over 10 years (it is currently in Season 13). The Livestock & Climate team identified major bottlenecks in the use of climate and financial services in the mixed systems of Kenya due to lack of climate and financial literacy. Thus, during 2023 (Shamba Shape Up Season 13), Livestock & Climate scientists worked collaboratively with The Mediae Company to record 9 episodes focusing on climate and financial literacy, and on practices to build climate resilience. These episodes have reached an estimated 7-8 million farmers, with benefits in terms of knowledge and attitude toward improved agricultural practice, productivity, and income.

MORE INFORMATION
Innovation Readiness justification
SSU aims to raise knowledge of good farming and 
nutrition practices, promote positive attitudes to change and ultimately change the ways in which farmers improve their production of crops and livestock; their consumption of nutritious foods and adoption of modern cooking practices. In this latest survey, nine in ten of the farmers who took part in the survey said that SSU was the TV programme they trusted the most to provide agricultural and farming information. Almost all viewers (96%) said they had learnt something new from the series. The most recalled topics from SSU 10 were harvesting and storage (62%), potato/sweet potato farming (40%) and modern cooking appliances (38%).

The innovation has been piloted  and upscaled in Ethiopia, and is now being implemented in Kenya and Tanzania. It is different to other community-based natural resource management approaches in that emphasis is placed on communities leading the process, with technical partners supporting and facilitating. Independent impact evaluations have highlighted its positive benefits on good governance including greater gender equity, rangelands and livestock production systems. In 2023 IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) entered into an agreement with ILRI to produce a practitioners manual for implementing PRM across the IGAD region with the input and consultation of all member states through a regional workshop. The manual is being finalized and its dissemination will be followed by a training of trainers program.

This is achieved by supporting policy-serving innovations, engaging in joint village land use planning (JVLUP) and facilitating participatory rangeland management (PRM). These efforts have resulted in a notable enhancement of pastoralists’ land tenure security and encouraging investments that enhance land productivity and where degraded, facilitating restoration in the four rangeland units being supported. In  2023, in response to the community's rangeland management plan, the community from the ALOLLE shared grazing land requested assistance to clear thorny bush from 112 hectares of land, that would then allow for grasses to regrow. ILRI and local NGO partner KINNAPA provided technical and minimal financial assistance to the community to undertake the clearance in October, with a larger area to be cleared in 2024.

Participatory land use planning in 
pastoral areas in Tanzania
Participatory land use planning across administrative borders in pastoral 
areas for protecting shared grazing lands and other resources.
Scaling Ambition
Participatory land use planning (PLUP) for pastoral areas overcomes 
many of the challenges of conventional land use planning, including 
creating hard boundaries around villages or other administrative 
units and breaking up and limiting or preventing access to shared 
grazing lands and water points. PLUP for pastoral areas aims to 
keep rangelands and particularly grazing lands intact, working 
across administrative boundaries through joint PLUP agreements 
strengthening reciprocal relations, collective tenure, and good 
governance, and resolving and preventing conflicts between 
land users. Pastoral communities traditionally marginalized from 
the village PLUP process benefit, particularly from the approach, 
because it is more inclusive of all land users in the planning and 
decision-making processes. The PLUP process includes collecting 
data for assessing the land potential most relevant for pastoral 
systems.CGIAR Innovation Packages and Scaling Readiness (IPSR)

CGIAR IPSR Report | Participatory land use planning in pastoral areas in TanzaniaINTRODUCTION
Innovation package design and scaling readiness assessment is a structured approach to designing innovative packages 
tailored to specific contexts. This process consists of four distinct steps: preparation, design and measurement, quality 
assurance, and reporting, and it can be conducted either as a 1-day workshop or a series of online workshops. The 
process enables the identification of CGIAR synergies and external partnerships tailored to the specific context while 
tracking changes in innovation package readiness and use over time.
In the first step of preparation, the innovation package design workshop is initiated by gathering the essential 
information required for the workshop. This entails identifying the core innovation and team, ensuring the 
participation of key internal decision-makers, obtaining necessary approvals and notifications, determining the context 
of the package, developing a scaling ambition, and identifying a list of experts who will be involved in the innovation 
package design and assessment.
The design step of the process involves the development and curation of enablers. These enablers can be existing or 
new but critical for scaling the core innovation in the selected context and are assessed for their readiness and use 
using the IPSR framework (link). The assessment scores are then validated through quality assurance, conducted in the 
following stage. All these activities are then documented in an Innovation Package and Scaling Readiness report, which 
is the final step. 
Under the LCSR initiative, ILRI spearheads this innovation package, which seeks to scale the core innovation of 
participatory land use planning in pastoral areas in Tanzania. The project entails providing research and policy support 
through collaboration with government partners and NGOs to address the challenges facing rangelands in Tanzania. 
The overarching goal of the innovation package design and scaling readiness assessment is to create a land use 
planning innovation package tailored specifically to the Tanzanian context.
In addition to designing an innovation package for participatory land use planning in pastoralist areas in Tanzania, 
the primary objective of the inaugural innovation package workshop was to evaluate the effectiveness of the IPSR 
innovation package process in creating an innovation packaging approach suitable for accelerating the scaling of 
innovations from the CGIAR. Our specific objectives were to:
• Assess whether the training provided on the Scaling Readiness and Use Frameworks was sufficient to enable 
participants to apply this knowledge on the same day.
• Determine how effectively the selected delivery methods and exercises produced each session’s desired 
outcomes.
• To determine the number and experience level demand to facilitate an innovation package workshop, we sought 
to determine the degree of demand for a facilitator for the different sessions. 
• Assess the adequacy of the prerequisite activities in preparing for a productive workshop.
IPSR aimed to make design adjustments from these lessons to improve the IPSR innovation packaging approach.circle-info

CGIAR IPSR Report | Participatory land use planning in pastoral areas in TanzaniaSCALING AMBITION
The scaling ambition is a dynamic statement of intent created by the core innovation team to steer scaling efforts. It 
is a continually evolving target and is considered a crucial tool for framing the scope of the scaling vision. A scaling 
ambition typically comprises the following critical components that have been deemed essential in shaping a scaling 
scope:
• Target year 2024)
• Lead scaling driver (initiative)
• Scaling partners
• What (core innovation)
• Users (farmers, NGOs organizations, policymakers)
• How many (innovation user 1, user 2)
• Where (geoscope)
• Outcomes targets
The scaling ambition for Participatory Land Use Planning in pastoral areas in Tanzania is outlined below:
By 2024, the Livestock and Climate Initiative and partners will work together with the National Land Use Planning 
Commission, District-level Participatory Land Use Management (PLUM) officers, and the Community level Village 
Councils/VLUMs (Village Land Use Management committees) to accomplish the use of Participatory land use 
planning in pastoral areas by 18,000 Farmers/ (agro-)pastoralists/ herders/ fishers of which 50% are women and 
30% are youth, 50 policy actors (public or private) of which 50% are women and 10% are youth, 10 community-
based organizations, 100 government officers in Tanzania pastoral areas to contribute achieving the following 
end of initiative outcomes: (1) At least 320,000 livestock producers (50% women and youth) and 13 public or 
private organizations access climate risk management strategies; (2) 80,000 households implement climate-smart 
practices and technologies appropriate to their production systems and their gender; (3) International agencies 
and policymakers use LCSR products to shape at least five policies or investments to strengthen socially inclusive 
low-emissions livestock production system resilience, including at least three aimed at realizing climate change-
related adaptation or mitigation progress by 2024.bullseye-pointer

INNOVATION PACKAGE DETAILS
To design the innovation package, the expert participants were divided into small groups and tasked with generating 
a list of enablers that could facilitate the scaling of the core innovation. The process entailed generating through 
ideation a short list of about three key enablers per group and ranking them according to their perceived importance. 
Additionally, the groups mapped each enabler to the relevant innovation category (see list of categories), identified 
any linkages to other existing enablers, and provided details on individuals or entities already working on these 
enablers.
The resulting list of enablers was curated to eliminate redundancies and exclude elements already integrated into 
the core innovation (such as village assembly meetings), items that fell beyond the project scope, and ideas that 
constituted mere enhancements rather than true enablers. This curation process resulted in the identification of eight 
key enablers that are critical to scaling the innovation.
The below table provides an overview of the core innovation and key enablers needed to achieve the scaling ambition.
A well-defined enabler should describe what it is, what it does, and who it’s for. For example, a radio program that 
informs farmers about drought-tolerant maize varieties or an online training for policymakers to promote evidence-
based policy advisory tools. However, our review of the listed enablers showed that most did not follow this best 
practice. This experience highlighted the need to improve the instructions given during the session to ensure all key 
elements are included in defining the enabler. Additionally, we recognized the need for real-time quality assurance to 
ensure that the group’s work produces the minimum required outputs.

LESSONS
• The two concepts of Scaling Readiness and Use Frameworks proved challenging for certain categories of 
stakeholders to learn and apply effectively in a single day. Therefore, the IPSR team will consider this for upcoming 
workshops when selecting the list of experts and stakeholders to involve in the packaging workshop. The team will 
continue exploring additional methods to guarantee that all participants comprehend and put into practice these 
frameworks within the limited time available.
• On the effectiveness of the chosen delivery methods and exercises, this initial experience emphasized the 
importance of simplifying the language used for clear and concise instructions and questions during the various 
breakout group exercises. The team reviewed certain exercises based on the group debriefs and outcomes 
to achieve the desired results, which would be implemented and tested in the upcoming innovation package 
workshops.
• The demand for facilitation was deemed average, requiring a facilitator with some facilitation training and average 
facilitation experience. To facilitate subsequent innovation packaging workshops effectively, we implemented a 
sequential orientation process that involves observing in one workshop, co-facilitating in the next, and leading in 
the third. We also identified areas in some sessions that required adjustment to enhance facilitation delivery for 
future innovation packaging workshops.
• In assessing the prerequisite activities, developing a scaling ambition was identified as a crucial step in establishing 
a scaling vision for reference in the workshop. However, the validation exercise of this scaling ambition was 
deemed redundant as there was limited room for revision, given that the work is based on an approved proposal 
and therefore constrained by its content. Therefore, the scaling ambition will be presented for future workshops, 
followed by a brief Q&A but no validation exercise.
• From the debrief with the core innovation team, the session that produced the enablers missed out on ideas 
that tackled the most crucial challenges that hinder the adoption of Participatory land use planning in pastoral 
areas in Tanzania. Important actions and enhancements to existing plans were suggested, but they were not 
enablers, for example, the preparation of detailed land use management plans to facilitate the provision of CCROs 
to landowners. Based on this insight, it was decided for subsequent workshops to modify the exercise by first 
identifying the challenges to scaling the core innovation in the context and then listing the enablers to address 
them. This approach would ensure that the group’s efforts are targeted and that enablers are not suggested 
arbitrarily.
• Language was an important factor in this workshop. Facilitation was majorly conducted in Swahili. However, 
the materials were not translated into Swahili, which limited some participants’ participation, especially the 
community group. Furthermore, since not all participants were Swahili speakers, results from group discussions 
had to be presented in both Swahili and English, which took twice the planned time. These lessons will inform the 
IPSR team’s development of guidance for future hybrid language workshops.book-open-reader

RangelandsExecutive summary
This report comprises findings from an independent impact assessment of the 
Piloting Participatory Rangeland Management project in Kenya and Tanzania. The 
study was conducted in November and December 2021 by African Research and 
Economic Development Consultants (AFREDEC), contracted by ILRI Livestock CRP 
(CGIAR Research Program). The main objective was to determine the impacts of 
participatory rangeland management (PRM) on rangelands, environment, good 
governance and management processes, security of rights to land and resources, 
livestock production, gender issues, women’s empowerment and other social equity 
aspects and on policy influence. The study identified key lessons learnt and best 
practices and opportunities for scaling up.
The assessment applied a mixed-method approach comprising quantitative data 
collected using household surveys and qualitative data collected using key informant 
interviews and focus group discussions. In total, 2,000 household representatives 
were interviewed through the survey, with almost 150 focus group discussion 
participants and more than 40 key informants.
The study revealed that pilot project had positive impacts.
 »Improved rangeland condition was a major impact reported by 96.1% and 
93.4% of the communities participating in the PRM pilot in Kenya and Tanzania. 
When asked about the first impacts observed during PRM implementation, 
50.1% in Kenya and 41.8% in Tanzania reported improved rangelands and as 
reflected in the activities implemented in the rangeland management units 
(RMUs) through rangeland management plans (RMPs) such as bush clearing, 
seeding pastures, improvement of grasses, tree planting and conservation and 
water conservation measures. Focus group discussions revealed that rangelands 
were well demarcated and visible that it was easier to differentiate land for crop 
production from grazing lands.
 »Improved community participation in rangelands governance and 
management was reported by over 90% of the community members 
participating in PRM in Kenya and Tanzania. This was partly a result of training 
on PRM given to government and communities, the establishment of functioning 
PRM coordination platforms, holding multi-stakeholder dialogues and 
establishing effective partnerships.
 »Security of rights to land and resources.  Improved participation of the 
community in governance and management of rangelands through the PRM 
process led to improved access to rangeland resources for the whole community 
and an increased feeling that the rangelands belong to them as a community. 
This was reported by over 90% of the community members participating in PRM 
in Kenya and Tanzania. There were fewer conflicts reported by 84% and 89% of 
the community members participating in PRM in Kenya and Tanzania.

CGIAR IPSR Report | Participatory land use planning in pastoral areas in Tanzania
Participatory land use planning in 
pastoral areas in Tanzania
Participatory land use planning across administrative borders in pastoral 
areas for protecting shared grazing lands and other resources.
Scaling Ambition
Participatory land use planning (PLUP) for pastoral areas overcomes 
many of the challenges of conventional land use planning, including 
creating hard boundaries around villages or other administrative 
units and breaking up and limiting or preventing access to shared 
grazing lands and water points. PLUP for pastoral areas aims to 
keep rangelands and particularly grazing lands intact, working 
across administrative boundaries through joint PLUP agreements 
strengthening reciprocal relations, collective tenure, and good 
governance, and resolving and preventing conflicts between 
land users. Pastoral communities traditionally marginalized from 
the village PLUP process benefit, particularly from the approach, 
because it is more inclusive of all land users in the planning and 
decision-making processes. The PLUP process includes collecting 
data for assessing the land potential most relevant for pastoral 
systems.CGIAR Innovation Packages and Scaling Readiness (IPSR)

CGIAR IPSR Report | Participatory land use planning in pastoral areas in TanzaniaINTRODUCTION
Innovation package design and scaling readiness assessment is a structured approach to designing innovative packages 
tailored to specific contexts. This process consists of four distinct steps: preparation, design and measurement, quality 
assurance, and reporting, and it can be conducted either as a 1-day workshop or a series of online workshops. The 
process enables the identification of CGIAR synergies and external partnerships tailored to the specific context while 
tracking changes in innovation package readiness and use over time.
In the first step of preparation, the innovation package design workshop is initiated by gathering the essential 
information required for the workshop. This entails identifying the core innovation and team, ensuring the 
participation of key internal decision-makers, obtaining necessary approvals and notifications, determining the context 
of the package, developing a scaling ambition, and identifying a list of experts who will be involved in the innovation 
package design and assessment.
The design step of the process involves the development and curation of enablers. These enablers can be existing or 
new but critical for scaling the core innovation in the selected context and are assessed for their readiness and use 
using the IPSR framework (link). The assessment scores are then validated through quality assurance, conducted in the 
following stage. All these activities are then documented in an Innovation Package and Scaling Readiness report, which 
is the final step. 
Under the LCSR initiative, ILRI spearheads this innovation package, which seeks to scale the core innovation of 
participatory land use planning in pastoral areas in Tanzania. The project entails providing research and policy support 
through collaboration with government partners and NGOs to address the challenges facing rangelands in Tanzania. 
The overarching goal of the innovation package design and scaling readiness assessment is to create a land use 
planning innovation package tailored specifically to the Tanzanian context.
In addition to designing an innovation package for participatory land use planning in pastoralist areas in Tanzania, 
the primary objective of the inaugural innovation package workshop was to evaluate the effectiveness of the IPSR 
innovation package process in creating an innovation packaging approach suitable for accelerating the scaling of 
innovations from the CGIAR. Our specific objectives were to:
• Assess whether the training provided on the Scaling Readiness and Use Frameworks was sufficient to enable 
participants to apply this knowledge on the same day.
• Determine how effectively the selected delivery methods and exercises produced each session’s desired

CGIAR IPSR Report | Participatory land use planning in pastoral areas in TanzaniaSCALING AMBITION
The scaling ambition is a dynamic statement of intent created by the core innovation team to steer scaling efforts. It 
is a continually evolving target and is considered a crucial tool for framing the scope of the scaling vision. A scaling 
ambition typically comprises the following critical components that have been deemed essential in shaping a scaling 
scope:
• Target year 2024)
• Lead scaling driver (initiative)
• Scaling partners
• What (core innovation)
• Users (farmers, NGOs organizations, policymakers)
• How many (innovation user 1, user 2)
• Where (geoscope)
• Outcomes targets
The scaling ambition for Participatory Land Use Planning in pastoral areas in Tanzania is outlined below:
By 2024, the Livestock and Climate Initiative and partners will work together with the National Land Use Planning 
Commission, District-level Participatory Land Use Management (PLUM) officers, and the Community level Village 
Councils/VLUMs (Village Land Use Management committees) to accomplish the use of Participatory land use 
planning in pastoral areas by 18,000 Farmers/ (agro-)pastoralists/ herders/ fishers of which 50% are women and 
30% are youth, 50 policy actors (public or private) of which 50% are women and 10% are youth, 10 community-
based organizations, 100 government officers in Tanzania pastoral areas to contribute achieving the following 
end of initiative outcomes: (1) At least 320,000 livestock producers (50% women and youth) and 13 public or 
private organizations access climate risk management strategies; (2) 80,000 households implement climate-smart 
practices and technologies appropriate to their production systems and their gender; (3) International agencies 
and policymakers use LCSR products to shape at least five policies or investments to strengthen socially inclusive 
low-emissions livestock production system resilience, including at least three aimed at realizing climate change-
related adaptation or mitigation progress by 2024.bullseye-pointer

INNOVATION PACKAGE DETAILS
To design the innovation package, the expert participants were divided into small groups and tasked with generating 
a list of enablers that could facilitate the scaling of the core innovation. The process entailed generating through 
ideation a short list of about three key enablers per group and ranking them according to their perceived importance. 
Additionally, the groups mapped each enabler to the relevant innovation category (see list of categories), identified 
any linkages to other existing enablers, and provided details on individuals or entities already working on these 
enablers.
The resulting list of enablers was curated to eliminate redundancies and exclude elements already integrated into 
the core innovation (such as village assembly meetings), items that fell beyond the project scope, and ideas that 
constituted mere enhancements rather than true enablers. This curation process resulted in the identification of eight 
key enablers that are critical to scaling the innovation.
The below table provides an overview of the core innovation and key enablers needed to achieve the scaling ambition.
A well-defined enabler should describe what it is, what it does, and who it’s for. For example, a radio program that 
informs farmers about drought-tolerant maize varieties or an online training for policymakers to promote evidence-
based policy advisory tools. However, our review of the listed enablers showed that most did not follow this best 
practice. This experience highlighted the need to improve the instructions given during the session to ensure all key 
elements are included in defining the enabler. Additionally, we recognized the need for real-time quality assurance to 
ensure that the group’s work produces the minimum required outputs.

LESSONS
• The two concepts of Scaling Readiness and Use Frameworks proved challenging for certain categories of 
stakeholders to learn and apply effectively in a single day. Therefore, the IPSR team will consider this for upcoming 
workshops when selecting the list of experts and stakeholders to involve in the packaging workshop. The team will 
continue exploring additional methods to guarantee that all participants comprehend and put into practice these 
frameworks within the limited time available.
• On the effectiveness of the chosen delivery methods and exercises, this initial experience emphasized the 
importance of simplifying the language used for clear and concise instructions and questions during the various 
breakout group exercises. The team reviewed certain exercises based on the group debriefs and outcomes 
to achieve the desired results, which would be implemented and tested in the upcoming innovation package 
workshops.
• The demand for facilitation was deemed average, requiring a facilitator with some facilitation training and average 
facilitation experience. To facilitate subsequent innovation packaging workshops effectively, we implemented a 
sequential orientation process that involves observing in one workshop, co-facilitating in the next, and leading in 
the third. We also identified areas in some sessions that required adjustment to enhance facilitation delivery for 
future innovation packaging workshops.
• In assessing the prerequisite activities, developing a scaling ambition was identified as a crucial step in establishing 
a scaling vision for reference in the workshop. However, the validation exercise of this scaling ambition was 
deemed redundant as there was limited room for revision, given that the work is based on an approved proposal 
and therefore constrained by its content. Therefore, the scaling ambition will be presented for future workshops, 
followed by a brief Q&A but no validation exercise.
• From the debrief with the core innovation team, the session that produced the enablers missed out on ideas 
that tackled the most crucial challenges that hinder the adoption of Participatory land use planning in pastoral 
areas in Tanzania. Important actions and enhancements to existing plans were suggested, but they were not 
enablers, for example, the preparation of detailed land use management plans to facilitate the provision of CCROs 
to landowners. Based on this insight, it was decided for subsequent workshops to modify the exercise by first 
identifying the challenges to scaling the core innovation in the context and then listing the enablers to address 
them. This approach would ensure that the group’s efforts are targeted and that enablers are not suggested 
arbitrarily.
• Language was an important factor in this workshop. Facilitation was majorly conducted in Swahili. However, 
the materials were not translated into Swahili, which limited some participants’ participation, especially the 
community group. Furthermore, since not all participants were Swahili speakers, results from group discussions 
had to be presented in both Swahili and English, which took twice the planned time. These lessons will inform the 
IPSR team’s development of guidance for future hybrid language workshops.book-open-reader

Executive summary
ILRI’s research and policy engagement brief
The international community invested more than US$1.8 billion in global livestock 
research from 1975 to 2018 and most of this investment has been publicly 
financed for International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Sub-Saharan Africa 
programs (McIntire & Grace, 2020). In the mid-1970s, at the time of its creation, 
ILRI’s predecessors included the International Livestock Centre for Africa and the 
International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases before it became 
a member of Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), 
a global research-for-development partnership of 15 centers working with hundreds 
of partners around the world for a food-secure future. Since then, ILRI has engaged 
in several research programs, including those related to animal genetics, production 
and health, primary production and tropical livestock systems.
In Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania, ILRI has leveraged its membership to ILC and as 
the ILC’s coordinator for rangelands initiative to drive several research and policy 
support programs to national governments in collaboration with national CSOs 
through national multi-stakeholder platforms. In Tanzania, ILRI is an active member 
of the National Engagement Strategy platform championed by ILC.
In these three countries, rangelands face several challenges including environmental 
degradation, urbanization, climate change and population growth. Specifically, 
population growth and urbanization have resulted in fragmentation of previously 
existing rangelands as competition for land is increasing due to the demand 
for multiple uses, for example, industrialization and cultivation. In response to the 
government’s requests to address challenges facing rangelands, ILRI has been 
working with ILC, of which it is a member, government partners and in-country 
NGOs to support research for developing land-use planning processes in pastoral 
areas through various initiatives under the umbrella of the CGIAR research program 
on Livestock and on Policies Institutions and Markets. Through these research 
and policy support initiatives, ILRI and its collaborators have developed innovative 
and sustainable approaches such as woreda (district) participatory land-use planning 
(WPLUP), joint village land-use planning (JVLUP) and County Spatial Planning (CSP) 
in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya respectively. It has also supported research into 
piloting group titles to land that are often more appropriate than individual land titles, 
particularly in pastoral communities.
Page 6:
Qualitative outcome study  The contribution of the CGIAR Research Program on Livestock to land use planning processes in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania6
Through the WLPUP, CSP and JVLUP processes, ILRI, as a member of ILC, government 
and non-government actors supported participatory land-use planning in these 
countries. ILRI’s research intervention outputs included 
(i) developing manuals and other guidance and training materials;
(ii)  policy dialogues and other workshops; 
(iii) developing blogs, policy briefs and other communications; 
(iv) capacity building; and 
(v) piloting the land-use planning processes. 
While these processes are still in the early stages of being ready for widespread 
upscaling, activities in Tanzania are further along compared to Kenya and Ethiopia. 
However, sufficient progress has been made to assess and document outcomes 
in all three countries. To ensure consistency, this report uses the term ‘participatory 
land-use planning’ which is an inclusive land-use planning process that considers 
participation of all parties, especially diverse groups of rural communities to refer 
to all ILRI’s research and policy support in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania.

Abridged findings
Innovation
ILRI’s research and policy support have led to innovations and improvements 
in participatory land-use planning processes in all three countries. The joint village 
land-use planning in Tanzania is the most innovative tool which until ILRI’s support 
and intervention was not mentioned in any of the country’s natural resources policies 
and laws but it is now included in the National Land use Planning Guidelines of 2020. 
In Ethiopia, the woreda participatory land-use planning was not practiced and Kenya’s 
county spatial planning was not widely practiced in the country even though it is 
provided for in the country’s constitution.
Use of manuals, toolkits and data by local and national governments
In these three countries, the manuals, toolkits and data that ILRI helped 
develop are used by local, county and national governments for policy deciding 
and implementating participatory land-use planning processes. These include 
Ethiopia’s woreda participatory land-use planning manuals for different uses, 
Tanzania’s Joint Village Land use Planning and all toolkits and annex to county 
spatial planning processes in Kenya.
Improved capacities of local, county and national government institutions
Through its collaborative research and policy support on land-use planning processes, 
ILRI contributed to strengthening grassroots, local, county-level coordination 
and administrative structures. Currently, functioning structures on the ground 
provide a foundation for rangeland management systems.
Scalability, sustainability and improvement 
on rangeland and land‑use planning processes
ILRI’s research and policy support on participatory land-use planning are scalable, 
sustainable and can be replicated, adopted and improved on to ensure rangeland 
resources are best-used by pastoral communities. In all three countries, ongoing 
initiatives by governments, development partners and CSOs are using ILRI supported 
approaches and tool kits to secure rangelands.
Gender mainstreaming in land‑use planning processes
ILRI’s participatory land-use planning manuals included information on how to make 
land-use planning inclusive of all members of the community, especially men and 
women. These inclusive processes have minimized gender disparity by engaging 
women in important decisions during participatory land-use planning processes, 
which is significant progress given that pastoralist traditions have often marginalized 
women’s participation in decision-making processes and property and resource 
ownership, including land and livestock.

SELECTED KEY RECOMMENDATIONS 
FOR ILRI’S FURTHER RESEARCH AND POLICY SUPPORT
 ? Review existing national guidelines and tool kits  including those developed 
through ILRI’s research and policy support to determine and update 
approximate costs of doing participatory land-use planning, especially joint 
village use planning, woreda participatory land-use planning and county 
spatial planning. Approximate cost estimates are critical for upscaling the tools 
and approaches developed and tested by ILRI and its partners in Ethiopia, 
Kenya and Tanzania.
 ? Scale up research that informs the uptake of problem-solving research 
and policy support , such as land-use planning processes through inclusive 
and sustained partnerships with government authorities and advocacy NGOs.
 ? Sustain capacity-building efforts  because government officials including 
county, district and national land-use commissions are political appointees 
and they cannot deliver if they are not trained and because some leave 
or are transferred or let-to over time after training.
 ? Research and policy support is a continuous process.  ILRI could monitor 
how the local (county, woreda and village) and national governments 
are adopting the tool kits it has co-developed with partners to allow 
for a better understan","8145"

Economic impact ABSTRACT  
This study reports on the adoption and impacts of CGIAR-related maize varieties in 18 major maize-producing 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) during 1995 –2015. Of the 1345 maize varieties released during this 
timeframe, approximately 60% had a known CGIAR parentage. About 34% (9.5 million ha) of the total maize 
area in 2015 was cultivated with ’new’ CGIAR-related maize varieties released between 1995 and 2015. In the 
same year, an additional 13% of the maize area was cultivated with ’old’ CGIAR-related maize varieties released 
before 1995. The aggregate annual economic benefit of using new CGIAR-related maize germplasm for yield 
increase in SSA was estimated at US$1.1 –1.6 billion in 2015, which we attributed equally to co-investments by 
CGIAR funders, public-sector national research and extension programs, and private sector partners. Given that 
the annual global investment in CGIAR maize breeding at its maximum was US$30 million, the benefit-cost ratios 
for the CGIAR investment and CGIAR-attributable portion of economic benefits varied from 12:1 –17:1, under the 
assumption of a 5-year lag in the research investment to yield returns. The study also discusses the methodo -
logical challenges involved in large-scale impact assessments. Post-2015 CGIAR tropical maize breeding efforts 
have had a strong emphasis on stress tolerance.   
1.Introduction 
Sustainably providing sufficient, nutritious, accessible, and afford -
able food supplies for a growing population of the Global South is a 
major challenge, which is aggravated by climate change (Con-
nolly-Boutin and Smit, 2016 ). The pathways to increase food production 
include expanding the land area under cultivation (extensification), 
increasing the intensity of production per unit of land, and increasing 
production efficiency. As extensification of agriculture often implies 
unfavorable societal and environmental trade-offs (Johnson et al., 
2014 ), sustainable intensification of existing production systems 
through technological change has become the focus of 
research-and-development (R&D) initiatives. Increased research in-
vestment and policies that enable structural changes in national and international agricultural R&D programs are essential, and it is equally 
important to monitor the effectiveness of these investments through 
rigorous impact assessments (Kubitza and Krishna, 2020 ). Here we 
examine the impact of CGIAR on improved maize germplasm with active 
investment and involvement of a diversity of national partners in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) over a 21-year period (1995 –2015). 
Globally, maize has strategic importance as a supplier of food and 
feed energy and protein (Poole et al., 2021; Erenstein et al., 2022 ). 
Technological innovations, combined with an expansion in the culti-
vated area, have enabled farmers to realize the global maize grain 
production of one billion tons per annum in 2013 and maintain a 
consistent, positive growth rate in yield (Byerlee and Edmeades, 2021 ). 
Despite the constantly increasing production, meeting global demand 
for maize from food, feed, and fuel markets has remained a major

2challenge for the producing countries, particularly in the Global South 
(Erenstein et al., 2022 ), where agricultural systems increasingly suffer 
from depletion and degradation of the resource-base, frequent pest 
infestation, and the vagaries of climate change (Challinor et al., 2016; 
Abro et al., 2021; Overton et al., 2021 ). The production conditions are 
particularly challenging in SSA for maize, with the increased intensity of 
biotic and abiotic stress factors, soils low in organic matter and other 
nutrients, and limited use of external inputs. As a result, African coun-
tries contributed only 7.5% of global maize production from an area 
share of 20.5% during 2010 –2020 (estimated using data from FAOSTAT, 
2022 ). Unlike the leading maize producers (e.g., the USA, China, and 
India), the yield growth registered in Africa has also been modest (12 kg 
ha_x0000_1 y_x0000_1, during 2010 –2020; estimated using data from FAOSTAT, 
2022 ), with significant intra-continental heterogeneity. Against these 
challenges, CGIAR maize R&D has been generating and popularizing 
yield-enhancing, stress-resilient, and nutrient-rich varieties and 
improved farming practices in close collaboration between the Inter-
national Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), the Inter-
national Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), national breeding 
programs, the private seed sector, and other national partners (Jones- -
Garcia and Krishna, 2021 ). 
Against the context of drastic institutional changes in the interna -
tional agricultural R&D and increasing intensity of biotic and abiotic 
stress factors limiting maize production, an examination of the role of 
CGIAR institutions in sustaining the maize yield growth in Africa is 
warranted. CGIAR, formerly known as the Consultative Group for In-
ternational Agricultural Research, established in 1971, is a global 
partnership that unites international organizations engaged in agricul -
tural R&D to ""deliver science and innovation that advance trans -
formation of food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis"" (CGIAR, 
2020 , p. 17). The pro-poor impacts of research conducted under the 
aegis of CGIAR have been previously documented (Renkow and Byerlee, 
2010 ). 
Historically, the maize breeding programs of CGIAR have been 
involved in developing new varieties with greater genetic yield potential 
(Byerlee and Edmeades, 2021; Masuka et al., 2017; Paudel et al., 2022 ), 
higher biotic and abiotic stress tolerance or resilience (e.g., 
drought-tolerant or DT maize; Katengeza and Holden, 2021 ; Prasanna 
et al., 2021 ), and enhanced nutrient content (e.g., quality protein maize 
or QPM; Goredema-Matongera et al., 2021 ; Maqbool et al., 2021 ) for 
farmers of South Asia, SSA, and Latin America. Development and 
dissemination of such varieties help adapt the maize production systems 
to climate change and to impart resistance to major biotic stresses, 
including diseases (e.g., maize streak virus, maize lethal necrosis, Tur-
cicum leaf blight, grey leaf spot, tar spot complex, stalk rots, ear rots, 
etc.), parasitic weeds (e.g., Striga spp.), and insect-pests (e.g., fall 
armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda ) (Prasanna et al., 2021; Gasura et al., 
2022; Kamweru et al., 2022 ). Since 2015, marker-assisted forward 
breeding and marker-assisted backcrossing have been effectively used in 
eastern and southern Africa by CIMMYT to introgress resistance to maize 
streak virus and maize lethal necrosis into diverse genetic backgrounds 
(Prasanna et al., 2021 ). Significant strides have also been made in 
breeding elite maize lines and hybrids with native genetic resistance to 
fall armyworm in Africa, based on the strong foundation of 
insect-resistant tropical germplasm developed by CIMMYT scientists in 
Mexico. These efforts are further intensified to develop and deploy elite 
maize cultivars with native fall armyworm tolerance / resistance and 
farmer-preferred traits suitable for diverse agroecologies in Africa and 
Asia (Prasanna et al., 2022 ). 
Over the last three decades, the CGIAR R&D investment has shown a 
gradual but significant change in the regional focus. A ""pivot to Africa,"" 
as described by Byerlee and Edmeades (2021) , was initiated from the 
funding crisis that CGIAR faced in the 1990s. The African focus on 
CGIAR maize breeding intensified even further after the establishment 
of the CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs), especially CRP MAIZE. A 
detailed history of the evolution of the maize breeding program in CGIAR is presented by Byerlee and Edmeades (2021) , which started with 
an optimism that due to the increased R&D investment, the African 
countries might be realizing a long-awaited ""maize revolution."" Despite 
the heightened Africa focus, CGIAR institutions continue to address the 
production constraints of smallholders in Asia and Latin America, with 
several maize varieties annually released in conjunction with public and 
private breeding institutions (Tesfaye et al., 2017; Guzzon et al., 2021 ). 
In this study, we estimate the impact of CGIAR germplasm on 
enhancing maize production in 18 target countries in SSA during 
1995 –2015. The effect of agricultural R&D under the aegis of CGIAR 
institutions has been closely scrutinized. Most of the past impact eval-
uations indicated favorable results. In one of the earliest global impact 
evaluations (Evenson and Gollin, 2003 ), the rates of returns on CGIAR 
investment in crop germplasm improvement were found to be within the 
range of 39% in Latin America to 100% in Asia over 1965 –1998. In a 
meta-analysis, Raitzer and Kelley (2008) showed that the benefit-cost 
ratios of CGIAR interventions could range from 2:1–17:1. A recent 
assessment reiterated the financial advantage of CGIAR research pro-
grams, indicating that investment in CGIAR R&D resulted in a 
benefit-cost ratio of 10:1 (Alston et al., 2022 ). Despite the reported 
significant economic gains realized from past investments, the stagna -
tion of international funding for agricultural R&D (Zeigler and Mohanty, 
2010 ) can be viewed only as a paradox. Given the drastic decline in 
CGIAR funding after 2014 (Beintema and Echeverría, 2020 ), the sys-
tematic documentation of the economic effects of international agri-
cultural R&D has become even more important. 
The present study updates the estimates of collaborative interna -
tional maize breeding for earlier periods: 1966 –1990 (Lopez-Pereira and 
Morris, 1994 ), 1966 –1998 (Morris et al., 2003 ), and 1981 –2005 (Alene 
et al., 2009 ). Our conservative assessments point toward an overall 
benefit-cost ratio ranging between 12:1 and 17:1 for R&D investment in 
CGIAR maize breeding in SSA, highlighting the economic value of 
increasing the public R&D investment across the Global South. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Study area 
We focused on the 18 major maize-producing countries of SSA: 
Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, 
Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, 
Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, from where data were available on 
varietal releases and their parentage. There was a steady increase in the 
aggregate maize area in these 18 countries during the study period, from 
17 million ha in 1995 to 28 million in 2015 (FAOSTAT, 2021 ). However, 
maize yields in Africa remained low, with a significant inter-country 
variation. Among the 18 focal countries in 2015, the average maize 
yield ranged from 0.6 t ha_x0000_1 (Zimbabwe) to 3.7 t ha_x0000_1 (Ethiopia), and no 
country in the subcontinent had a yield above the global average (5.5 t 
ha_x0000_1; FAOSTAT, 2021 ). 
For CGIAR centers, the enhancement of maize production in SSA has 
become a top priority since the mid-1980s (Byerlee and Edmeades, 
2021 ). CIMMYT and IITA continuously exchanged improved maize 
germplasm and integrated novel tools and technologies to increase ge-
netic gains in the stress-prone environments of the continent. CIMMYT, 
in particular, integrated doubled haploid technology, high-throughput,

breeding pipelines (Chaikam et al., 2019 ). Since 2002, the two centers 
have intensified public-private partnerships to strengthen the maize 
seed systems in the target countries of Africa. Several third-party funded 
projects, such as ’Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa, ’ ’Stress Tolerant 
Maize for Africa, ’ ’Water Efficient Maize for Africa, ’ ’Improved Maize 
for African Soils, ’ and seed-sector-related investments provided a strong

32.2. Estimating the contribution of CGIAR germplasm in recent maize 
varietal releases 
Parentage or pedigree information for different improved maize 
varieties released between 1995 and 2015 was required to determine the 
contribution of CGIAR germplasm. However, the parentage of 
commercialized maize varieties, especially from the private sector, is 
often not disclosed for various reasons (Morris et al., 2003 ). Moreover, 
for a cross-pollinated crop like maize, it is not easy to calculate the 
percentage of germplasm contribution from different sources and pro-
vide the exact contributions of the different institutions involved in the 
varietal release. Therefore, we relied on the ’reported CGIAR germplasm 
contribution ’ from a purposive expert survey, especially for those vari-
etal releases lacking exact pedigree information. A structured ques-
tionnaire was sent to public-sector agricultural research programs, 
including ministries of agriculture, research and extension institutes and 
agricultural universities, CIMMYT and IITA regional offices, and private 
sector scientists and managers operating in SSA, with a covering letter 
ensuring confidentiality. The questionnaire elicited the details at the 
individual variety level for the region or country, including varietal 
name, release year, pedigree, relation to CGIAR institutions, the main 
use of the variety in the country (food, feed, etc.), cultivar type (OPV, 
hybrid, etc.), maturity (early, late, etc.), grain color, suitable agroecol -
ogy for the variety, nutritional attributes, and success rate in terms of 
adoption rate. The expert survey dataset was instrumental in estimating 
the CGIAR relationship in the varietal releases and for adoption 
estimation.1 
Based on the data obtained from expert surveys and secondary 
sources, maize varieties were assigned to five categories based on CGIAR 
germplasm relationship: (1) varieties with 100% CGIAR parentage (all 
parents derived from CGIAR germplasm), (2) varieties with significant 
CGIAR parentage (50–99%), (3) varieties with some CGIAR parentage 
(1–49%), (4) varieties with no known/reported CGIAR parentage, and 
(5) varieties of unknown parentage. Because of category (5), the esti-
mates for the contribution of CGIAR maize germplasm to varietal re-
leases reported in this study may be cautiously approached and 
understood as the lower bound values and a likely underestimation of 
the real impact. Varieties for which only qualitative information was 
obtained from the experts and/or literature (e.g., some sources revealed 
CGIAR germplasm parentage only as ""mostly,"" ""limited,"" etc.) are 
included in the best corresponding categories of (2) or (3). The category 
of ’CGIAR-related varieties, ’ which is the focus of the present study, is 
generated as the aggregate of (1)-(3). For a meaningful inter-country 
comparison, we estimated the annual varietal release intensities, 
calculated as the number of maize varieties released in a country per 
annum during 1995 –2015 divided by the area under maize in the base 
year (1995). 
2.3. Estimating the on-farm varietal adoption 
We gathered the adoption data from the 18 target countries for the 
study period from all available sources. As the foundation, we used an 
expert survey focusing on estimated varietal adoption for the most 
recent year (2015). We sent a semi-structured questionnaire to 71 maize 
scientists/ managers from private and public maize breeding programs 
in these countries in 2016 and received 43 respondents, resulting in a response rate of 61%. The dataset was further enriched with a list of 
improved maize varieties released during 1995 –2015 from the seed 
catalogs, variety registers, and data collected from earlier studies, 
including that of Walker and Alwang (2015) , peer-reviewed journal 
papers, and project reports. These sources also provided the pedigree 
information (i.e., CGIAR germplasm relationship) and the estimated 
area coverage of individual varieties. A list of reviewed studies is pro-
vided in Supplementary Materials S1. Of the total of 1548 
variety-specific adoption data points over the study period, 27% were 
from published literature, 50% from unpublished project documents 
(especially CGIAR project, ""Diffusion and Impact of Improved Varieties 
in Africa,"" DIIVA; www.asti.cgiar.org/diiva), 12% from seed registries, 
and 10% from CIMMYT expert surveys. The adoption figures on OPVs 
relied more on unpublished data and literature review, whereas those on 
hybrids relied on unpublished reports and seed sales registries. 
Unlike the expert survey estimates, the reported adoption figures 
from the literature do not correspond to a single year. However, to es-
timate the CGIAR germplasm contribution to the varieties grown each 
year, we required data on annual adoption rates for individual varieties 
over the entire study period. The temporal adoption patterns were ob-
tained by extrapolating data from different points in time for each 
released variety in use. We assumed a linear increase from zero in the 
year of release to the first observed average adoption rate. We assumed 
that the adoption rate would hold constant at the observed level for five 
years and then decline to zero over the next five years. The estimated 
diffusion rates were uniformly rescaled as needed to ensure the aggre -
gate estimated adoption in a particular year did not exceed 100%. We 
acknowledge that the assumptions behind the extrapolation of temporal 
adoption patterns across sources are strong and also recognize that the 
estimates from different sources may vary in their robustness and 
representativeness. At the same time, the dependence on multiple 
sources for obtaining the adoption rates of individual varieties could 
result in more robust aggregate adoption estimates. 
2.4. Estimating the impact of CGIAR germplasm 
2.4.1. Estimating the yield effects of CGIAR germplasm 
The first step of the economic impact estimation of CGIAR germ -
plasm on maize production in SSA is an assessment of the grain yield 
effects of CGIAR-related varieties. Panel data regression models with 
country-level fixed effects were employed to capture the effect of the 
change in acreage share of maize varieties with CGIAR parentage on 
national maize yield. National-level maize yield was used as the 
dependent variable, and the estimated share of maize area under the 
new and old CGIAR germplasm-related varieties as the key independent 
variables. The comparison is made amongst all alternative varieties (i.e., 
old/new non-CGIAR varieties and varieties without parentage infor-
mation), and these varieties occupied nearly two-thirds of the maize 
area in the study countries in 2015. 
The conventional fixed-effects models control for cross-section het-
erogeneity and time-invariant unobservable factors while improving the 
efficiency of parameter estimates. However, to precisely estimate the 
relationship between maize yield and CGIAR germplasm contribution in 
varietal development, we must also control for unobserved time-variant 
heterogeneity. For this purpose, we used a Dynamic Panel Data (DPD) 
model with a balanced dataset between 1995 and 2015. Arellano and 
Bond (1991) developed a Generalized Method of Moments(GMM) esti-
mator for the DPD model using the first difference of the equation. In our 
case, the model was estimated as: 
Δln(yit)=a+ l1Δln(yit_x0000_1)+ l2Δln(yit_x0000_2)+ b2ΔCGIAR it_x0000_j
+∑k
k=1gkCitk+ h(T)+(eit_x0000_eit_x0000_1)(1) 
where yit is the national maize yield (kg ha_x0000_1) in the country i in year 
t, derived from the FAOSTAT (2021) database. CGIAR it is the share of 
CGIAR-related varieties in the national maize acreage, Citk is the set of k 1 There has been relatively limited technology monitoring in relation to 
maize breeding programs in SSA, making information on varietal release and 
farmer adoption of individual varieties not easily available or limited in scope. 
At the same time, data collection from maize breeders and project managers 
was time-consuming and slow. Furthermore, there were several inconsistencies 
in the data initially collected, especially with respect to the adoption figures. 
The reiterative development of the database and methodological approach took 
about three years (2016 –2018), and statistical analysis was initiated in 2019. V.V. Krishna et al.

4country-specific variables (including gross cropped area, percentage 
share of maize area, percentage share of irrigated area, annual rainfall, 
chemical fertilizer use in the country), T is the dummy variable standing 
for the time of observation, and eit is the remainder disturbance that can 
vary over time and countries. In the variable set Citk, we included only 
the time variant elements that are available for the study period for all 
countries and have a potential effect on maize grains. All time-invariant 
country-specific variables will be omitted in the model estimation, and 
hence many policy- and market-specific variables were not suitable to 
include. 
Our primary focus is to estimate b2, the effects of CGIAR-related 
germplasm on national maize yield. Estimation of Eq. (1) requires an 
instrumental variable to correct for endogeneity, especially with the 
variable CGIAR it and for correlation between the lagged differences of 
the dependent variable and eit_x0000_1. Under additional assumptions, it is 
possible to construct an alternative GMM estimator that overcomes this 
problem. Here we follow Arellano –Bover/Blundell –Bond estimation 
(Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998 ), which is a linear 
DPD model with lags of the dependent and key explanatory variables. 
Similar models have been used by several researchers of agricultural 
economics to avoid endogeneity and to generate robust impact estimates 
(Klomp and Haan, 2013; Krishna et al., 2015 ). The yield effect size (b2) is 
then compared with the farm-level impact of CGIAR germplasm from 
the literature. 
In some countries (e.g., Nigeria), a significant share of farmer 
acreage under maize in 2014 and 2015 was cultivated with ’varieties of 
unknown parentage ’ that might or might not include CGIAR-related 
varieties. To verify to what extent such measurement error affects the 
model estimates, we have re-run Eq. (1) with a reduced sample. Ob-
servations from years when varieties with unknown parentage were 
greater than 10% were excluded from the model estimation. 
The CGIAR adoption percentage may stand proxy for the changing 
breeding capabilities of the study countries, and hence, one may argue 
that our approach overestimates the effect size. We included the number 
of researchers and share of researchers working in the public sector with 
a 5-year lag (obtained from Beintema et al., 2012 ) among the explana -
tory variables in the regression function and compared the effect of 
CGIAR varieties across the two sets of regression models. An insignifi -
cant change in the CGIAR impact estimates would reject the hypothesis 
that the model estimates capture the effect of an increase in the breeding 
capacity of the study nations. 
Finally, we attempt to identify the sources of the CGIAR germplasm 
effect, hypothesized to be dependent on the type of varieties that were 
replaced due to the spread of CGIAR varieties: old non-CGIAR varieties 
(including local varieties) or new ones. Varietal age, germplasm 
adaptability to the local agroclimatic conditions, genetic potential, and 
seed quality generate the yield effect, had the old varieties been 
replaced. On the other hand, germplasm adaptability and genetic po-
tential dominate when new varieties are replaced. Delineating these 
factors is a challenging task. We categorized observations into two 
groups, based on farmer adoption of new maize germplasm (both CGIAR 
and non-CGIAR, released after 1994) and taking the 50% adoption rate 
as the cutoff. The observations from 2006 to 2015 are analyzed using 
regression tools to see whether there is a significant difference in the 
effect size across the two groups. We excluded the 1995 –2005 obser -
vations for not having information on non-CGIAR varieties released 
immediately before (e.g., varieties released in 1994, which would 
qualify as a recently released modern variety during that period). While 
a significant difference in effect magnitude across the groups would 
indicate the potential causal pathways, this approach has certain limi-
tations – a reduced sample size, the lack of accurate data on old local 
varieties, endogenous factors (e.g., government policies) that affect 
general seed sector development, CGIAR institutional performance and 
maize productivity, etc. A more sophisticated approach would be 
allowing for a heterogeneous impact of CGIAR germplasm by including 
a quadratic term of share of maize area under CGIAR-related varieties in the regression analysis. We anticipate the marginal effect of CGIAR va-
rieties to be high when its diffusion is low because there will still be a 
significant area share with low productive varieties in the comparison 
group. The marginal effect is expected to diminish with increasing 
diffusion as the lowest-yielding varieties are gradually ousted from the 
agroecosystems and the control group, and the comparison is made with 
the well-adapted non-CGIAR varieties that survived the competition 
from the CGIAR varieties for the cultivated area. 
2.4.2. Estimating the economic surplus changes 
To estimate the economic impacts of CGIAR-related germplasm 
through yield enhancement, we employed an equilibrium displacement 
model. The partial equilibrium framework has long been used in eval-
uating commodity-related technological progress in agriculture for 
impact assessments (Krishna and Qaim, 2008; Alene et al., 2018 ). The 
economic surplus changes due to intervention (for this study, 
CGIAR-related germplasm) were estimated based on a parallel shift in 
the supply curve of the commodity (for this study, maize grain). The 
economic benefits from CGIAR maize germplasm coupled with in-
vestments from the diversity of national partners and seed companies 
were estimated separately for each study country within a framework 
for the small open economy adapted for ex-post impact evaluation 
(Alston et al., 1995 ). However, since the 18 study countries taken 
together only represent a limited share of global foreign trade in maize: 
e.g., 1% of world import quantity and 0.5% of world export quantity 
during the second half (2006 –2015) of the study period (FAOSTAT, 
2021 ), we assume no spillover effects of the yield increase in SSA over to 
the global maize economy and other maize producing countries. The 
economic surplus attributed to CGIAR maize germplasm at the time t 
(ESt)was estimated as: 
ESt=PtQtKt(1_x0000_0.5Ktε) (2)  
where Pt and Qtare the average real-world market price of maize and 
the total maize production of the country in year t,respectively. For the 
present analysis, we used the international price of maize grain in 2015 
and estimated the surplus values. The per-unit cost reduction results in a 
supply function shift of magnitude Kt. Finally, ε is the price elasticity of 
the supply of maize grains. Using these parameters, the supply shift due 
to CGIAR-related germplasm was calculated as: 
Kt=((ΔY/Y)
ε_x0000_ΔC/C
1+ΔY/Y)
.At (3) 
ΔY/Y and ΔC/C are the average proportional change in yield and 
average proportional change in the variable costs per land unit associ -
ated with technology adoption, and At is the adoption rate of CGIAR- 
related varieties (share of maize area in the country). The net yield 
gain for recent CGIAR-related varieties over others (including old 
CGIAR-related varieties, recent and old non-CGIAR varieties, and land-
races) was derived from the regression estimates. We assumed that the 
cultivation of CGIAR-related maize varieties did not cause a variable 
cost change, making ΔC/C=0 (i.e., the new CGIAR-related seed cost is 
the same as that of non-CGIAR varieties, and we assume no change in 
other input use).2 
2 The strong assumption of no cost increase is one of the limitations of our 
partial equilibrium framework estimates, which was included due to a lack of 
sufficient empirical evidence to assume otherwise. More socioeconomic studies 
are required to assess the effect of CGIAR germplasm on the production process 
at the farm-level, especially on external input use. Several of the CGIAR in-
ventions are risk-reducing, and the increased certainty of production could 
generate a behavioral change in farmers to spend more on inputs. V.V. Krishna et al.

53.Results 
3.1. Maize varietal releases and CGIAR germplasm contribution 
The details of improved maize varieties released during 1995 –2015 
and CGIAR germplasm contribution in their parentage are depicted in  
Fig. 1 (and Appendix I). During the study period, a total of 1345 maize 
varieties were released in the 18 focus countries. The average number of 
annual varietal releases varied from <1 per annum in Benin, Cameroon, 
Guinea, Madagascar, and Senegal to 11–12 per annum in Kenya and 
Zambia (Fig. 1A). The release intensity was the highest for Rwanda (23 
varieties per million ha) and Zambia (22 varieties) and the lowest for 
Nigeria and Cameroon (0.83 varieties) (Fig. 1B). Among all the maize 
varieties released between 1995 and 2015, about 60% had CGIAR 
inbred lines directly in their pedigree or had parental lines with some 
CGIAR origin (Fig. 1C). About 78% of CGIAR varieties with known 
parentage were developed by the public sector, 5% under public-private 
partnerships, and the rest (17%) solely by the private sector. In contrast, 
most (88%) non-CGIAR varieties were developed by private companies. 
We suspect a certain degree of under-reporting of varieties with CGIAR 
parentage, especially in the large maize producer countries, such as 
Kenya, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania, etc., where the share of vari-
eties with unknown parentage was high. In these countries, a large share 
of varieties was developed as crosses of CGIAR and non-CGIAR germ -
plasm (e.g., 42% in Kenya), pointing toward significant collaborative 
R&D efforts of the national public and private sector partners. However, 
all uses of CGIAR germplasm (and hence their presence in the parentage) 
might not always be (fully) acknowledged by the partner institut","8898"

The challenge  
Smallholder agriculture in Africa includes  
over 33 million farms contributing to over  
70% of the continent's food supply, yet  
only a fraction of them have access to  
financial services. The fintech industry  
including financial and digital service  
providers, banks, microfinance  
institutions, credit cooperatives, and  
other rural lenders,  are hesitant in  
extending their support to smallholders.  
The geographical dispersion, small size  
farms, data scarcity, information gap and  
lack of enabling  conditions  pose  
significant challenges for lending  
institutions to target smallholders and for  
farmers to prove their creditworthiness.  
Additiona lly, the modest loan sizes these  
farmers seek, lead to inflated operational  
costs for lenders, discouraging much - 
needed  support.  
 
In Kenya alone, more than US$800 million  
of livestock production annually, is  
exposed to different climate -related  
hazards. The dairy industry's vulnerability  
to weather and climate extremes such as  
droughts and heat stress further adds to  
the perceived risk of lending to farmers.  
Adaptation is vital for building resilience  
to such weather extremes. However, in  
Kenya, green financing for climate  
adaptation is generally limited. Only a  
fraction of public -private resources are  
allocated annually, severely falling short  
of the nation's adaptation finance  
requirements outlined in its NDCs —43.9  
billion  US$ by 20302. 
 
Bridging this financing gap is pivotal, and  
an imperative shift in agricultural  
financing industry is needed. Such shift  
holds  the key  to transforming  Kenya's   
 
agricultural landscape into one that  
thrives  amid  climate risk.  
 
 
The innovation  
To address these issues, a novel data - 
driven climate -credit scoring tool tailored  
to dairy farmers has been developed by  
the Livestock & Climate CGIAR initiative.  
More specifically, the tool is developed by  
the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT, in  
partnership  with  Financial  Access  
Consulting Services (FACS), a financial  
advisory and technology solutions  
provider based in Kenya. The climate  
module is embedded in the digital credit  
service tool (LendXS) of FACS, which has  
been successfully implemented in Africa  
and South -East Asia since  2019.  
 
The tool combines climate hazards  
calculated state -of-the-art weather and  
climate data and indicators developed by  
dairy experts into an intuitive, easy -to-use 
risk scoring tool. The tool is validated by  
on-farm observations and is currently  
being piloted in multiple branches of  
ECLOF—one of the major MFIs in dairy  
sector in Kenya. By leveraging data  
analytics, this innovative tool can assess  
climate -related risks,  provide a

comprehensive financial assessment to  
banks and empower dairy farmers by  
identifying adaptation pathways, making  
them  more  appealing  to lenders.  
 
Positive credit scores serve as a gateway  
for borrowers, enabling them to secure  
their initial loans and establish a credit  
history. Importantly, credit scoring  
eliminates biases, ensuring a fair  
assessment based  on objective  
parameters and equal credit opportunities  
for all farmer applicants. By predicting the  
likelihood of defaults or late payments by  
linking production to climate, climate - 
credit scoring empowers lenders to make  
informed decisions, effectively managing  
portfolio risks. Furthermore, the s core and  
underlying  indicators  can be adjusted  in 
an iterative process based on repayment  
behavior, changes in practices by the  
farmer, and changes in the enabling  
environment and  climate conditions.  
Additionally, it streamlines the evaluation  
process, allowing swift and consistent  
assessment of credit applications,  
ultimately contributing to the  
maintenance of a stable lending portfolio  
through an accurate and enhanced risk  
assessment.  
 
The credit  risk framework  
The climate -credit scoring tool enhances  
traditional credit assessment by  
integrating the 5Cs (character, capacity,  
capital, collateral, and conditions) with a  
crucial addition —climate risk assessment.  
The tool evaluates farmer applicant  
profiles, including personal and socio - 
economic data, ownership and collateral,  
farm quality and management, financial  
position, and climate risk. Through this  
framework, financial institutions gain a  
holistic understanding of a farmer's  
creditworthiness, ensuring a more  
accurate  and nuanced evaluation  for lending decisions in the face of climate  
uncertainties. These scores  are 
categorized into different risk buckets,  
allowing financial institutions to align  
lending decisions precisely with their risk  
tolerance. A flexible value elicitation  
approach is followed allowing institutional  
specificity.

Climate  profiling  
The climate profiling is based on three  
pillars, namely, exposure, sensitivity, and  
adaptive capacity, as proposed by the  
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  
Change (IPCC). Critical hazards most likely  
to affect dairy farms are identified using  
literature review and expert  
consultations. Hazard indices for  
identified risk domains (like heat stress,  
drought, flood) are then calculated  
(powered by the Adaptation Atlas ) and  
fed into the tool. The scoring logic  
combines the hazards and indices based  
on weights derived from in -depth  
livestock expert interviews and pairwise  
ranking  technique.  
 
To measure each indicator, a  
comprehensive questionnaire was  
developed, and field tested with a group  
of farmers, with active participation of  
loan officers. The indicators and scoring  
logic are repeatedly tested and fine -tuned  
with livestock  and climate experts,  
Page 5:

Page  5 of 7  
  
technical officers, and farmers. Finally, all  
the relevant indicators (around 30) are  
combined into an aggregated score based  
on overall weights, which are determined  
together  with  lending  institutions  (ECLOF)  
based on the risk appetite or strategic  
portfolio  preferences.  
 
To aid financial institutions, a user - 
friendly climate profile tab is integrated  
into the FACS LendXS platform. This  
feature visualizes climate risks and scores,  
offering a deeper understanding beyond  
the basic score. It includes a map function  
displaying farmers' locations within  
specific climatic contexts and illustrates  
hazard representations for the dairy value  
chain across Kenya. The tool, equipped  
with a user -friendly climate profile tab,  
significantly enhances the understanding  
of climate risks and scores for financial  
institutions and farmers alike, enabling a  
more informed assessment of the climate  
resilience and adaptation pathways of the  
farmers. The data  analytics from the tool  
can help the financial institutions to  
disseminate score -related information to  
farmers -on how to identify adaptation  
activities and improve their credit - 
worthiness  for the future.

scoring  tool,  showing  scores  for a farm  location.  
 
The scaling  strategy  
The developed climate -credit scoring tool  
presents a groundbreaking opportunity  
for financial  institutions  to revolutionize  their lending practices. To scale this  
innovation effectively, collaborative  
partnerships between climate experts,  
lending institutions, and technology  
developers are crucial. The pilot phase of  
this project aims to test the scoring tool  
on a group of around 500 farmers by the  
end of 2023 in different locations in  
Kenya.  
 
Going forward, the team will continue to  
improve the scoring logic based on the  
data collected, creating a continuous  
feedback loop. We aim at integrating the  
tool into other existing lending platforms  
aside of LendXS, so that several other  
financial institutions can streamline the  
assessment process, ensuring swift and  
accurate evaluations for a broader pool of  
applicants. Training financial professionals  
in understanding and utilizing the tool will  
be a pivotal step, enhancing the tool's  
impact. The learnings will be disseminated  
through different scaling workshops and  
meetings with potential partners, both  
within  and beyond  Kenya.  
 
This initiative not only fosters financial  
inclusion for vulnerable agricultural  
communities but also aligns lending  
practices with sustainable development  
goals.  With  careful  integration,  
continuous testing, and stakeholder  
collaboration, this climate -credit scoring  
tool can not only mitigate risks for lenders  
but can also empower farmers to navigate  
the challenges of a changing climate. As  
the financial industry moves forward, this  
innovative approach sets a standard for  
responsible  and informed  lending,  
creating conditions for a more secure  
future for both lenders and borrowers in  
the face  of climate  change.

 Executive Summary  
This brief explores the significant challenges faced by smallholder dairy farmers in Africa amidst 
escalating climate uncertainties. It delves into how climatic extremes - droughts, floods, and heat stress - 
critically impact agricultural productivity and the ensuing reluctance of financial institutions to invest in 
this high -risk sector. Innovatively, it introduces a climate -conscious credit scoring system that integrates 
climate risk and adaptation strategies into credit assessments, thereby making farmer s more attractive to 
lenders. Key adaptation measures, including efficient cooling, breed resilience, water and feed 
management, insurance solutions, and climate information systems  or serv ices, are highlighted. The brief 
advocates for collaborative efforts among stakeholders and policy interventions to enhance the resilience 
and sustainability of smallholder dairy farming in Africa, ensuring not only economic stability but also food 
security in  the face of climate change.  
Financial Uncertainty in the Fields: Navigating Climate Risks for Africa's Smallholder 
Farmers  
Smallholder dairy farmers in Africa are uniquely impacted by the unpredictable nature of their 
environment, a reality that significantly influences their livelihoods and productivity. Unlike other 
agricultural practices, dairy farming demands consistent an d stable conditions, given the sensitivity of 
dairy cattle to climatic extremes. These farmers are particularly vulnerable to erratic rainfall, prolonged 
droughts, and sudden floods, which not only affect the health and productivity of their livestock but also 
the quality and availability of fodder. Such climate variability directly impacts milk yield and quality, 
thereby threatening the economic stability of these dairy farms. Moreover, this heightened climate risk 
results in a cautious approach from finan cial institutions, limiting the farmers' access to essential credit 
services needed for farm improvement and adoption of climate -resilient practices.
The Innovation  
To address these issues and unlock financial 
opportunities , The Alliance of Bioversity and 
CIAT , in partnership with Financial Access 
Consulting Services (FACS), have reviewed 
literature on smallholder dairy farming and 
climate change to highlight key adaptation 
measures that can de -risk the sector and improve 
access to finance. This review forms par t of a 
wider objective to develop climate “conscious” 
credit risk scoring system under the  CGIAR  
Clim ate Resilience  and Livestock and Climate  
Initiatives in Kenya.  By leveraging data analytics, 
this innovative system can assess climate -related 
risks , quantify , and integrate adaptation measures  
and empower dairy farmers, making them more 
appealing to lenders and fostering the resilience 
and growth of the dairy sector in Africa.  
To achieve this  in the tool , a methodology  is 
developed to  integrat e adaptation strategies into  farmer  credit scoring systems. This innovative 
approach directly quantifies , and tracks  risk 
reduction achieved through the adaptation 
mechanisms, reflecting the de -risking efforts in 
the farmers' credit ratings. Embedding these 
strategies into the credit scoring process  enables  
lending institutions to more accurately assess the 
creditworthiness of dairy farmers who have 
adopted climate -smart practices. Collaboration 
with the Livestock and Climate initiative of the 
CGIAR, alongside validation from livestock 
exper ts from the ILRI (International Livestock 
Research Institute) and The Alliance of Bioversity 
and CIAT , has allowed for the quantification and 
weighting of the impact of these adaptation 
measures. This process helps to de -risk loans for 
farmers in the dairy sector.  
Gender and social inclusion experts were also 
consulted to include how different adaptation 
strategies affect gender and gender related 
dynamics in different w ays. The tool  not only 
Page 4:

 makes smallholders more attractive prospects for 
loans but also promotes a proactive approach to 
climate resilience. The first step in deve loping this 
approach involved a scoping study of existing 
adaptation actions in the dairy sector in Kenya. 
The results from the scoping exercise were then 
fed into developing the climate -credit scoring 
tool.  
In this brief, we highlight specific adaptation 
measures, identified through this scoping 
exercise based on extensive literature review and 
expert consultations . The taxonomy of adaptation 
measures in dairy identified here  help in 
benchmarking the existing evidence on how 
adaptation helps in addressing different climatic 
risks, under what farm management systems  are 
the biggest gains seen and ultimately what 
enabling conditions are required to create 
adaptation opportunities in the dairy sector.  
Climate Risk in Dairy Farming  
The current implementation of the system focuses  
on Kenya where the d airy farmers are being hit 
hard by climate change.  Two major climate 
hazards that are impacting the sector are 
droughts and heat stress . Dairy farming is highly 
sensitive  to climate change and variability, and 
small holder dairy farming faces a high risk of 
reduced productivity resulting from extreme 
weather events .  
Kimaro and Chibinga (2013) note that the d irect 
effect of increased ambient temperature and 
concurrent changes in heat exchanges is heat 
stress , which influences cattle growth, 
reproduction performance, milk production, wool 
production,  and animal health and welfare.  
Drought conditions also affect  dairy cattle by 
drying wetlands, pastureland, water resources, 
streams and decreasing availability of drinking 
water for livestock (Bekele, 2018). A ccess to water 
is key for dairy farmers and  continuous access to 
clean water is vital for effective dairy production, 
with an adult healthy dairy animal requiring about 
75 litres  of water dail y. There is also an  impact on 
the growth of palatable grass species and the 
regeneration of fodder species in pasture which 
creates shortages in livestock fodder, affects nutritional quality, and consequently lowers milk 
production of cattle (Digambar 2011).  
The study by Klinedinst et al. (1993)  revealed that  
abnormally high  temperatures may reduce  milk 
production by up to 20% and conception rates by 
as much as 35% in dairy cattle . These climatic 
impacts therefore directly impact the level of 
uncertainty and riskiness of smallholder dairy 
farmers.  
Beyond the farm, this has a wider consequence of 
reducing the ability of such dairy farmers to attract 
and access commercial loans from financial 
institutions as they are perceived to be 
increasingly risky prospects for lending. Farmer 
adoption of strategi c adaptation measures is 
essential to de -risking their activities and 
positioning them favorably for financial access.   
De-risking Adaptation Measures  
Cooling and Heat Management  
Implementing cooling techniques is a n impactful 
adaptation strategy that can significantly benefit 
smallholder dairy farmers facing the challenges of 
climate change. One effective method involves 
providing roof and shading structures to minimize 
the impact of solar radiation heat transfer, 
particularly during the hot afternoon hours. This 
approach aims to reduce the overall heat load on 
dairy animals, allowing evaporative, convective, 
or conductive cooling mechanisms to operate 
more efficiently.  
A study conducted by Ji et al (2020) generated  
results  showing that cows provided with cooling 
maintained nearly 5% higher milk yields, along 
with a 14% increase in dry matter intake and an 18 
beats -per-minute reduction in respiration rate, 
compared to their non -cooled counterparts.  
Historically, shading has proved to be an effective 
technique.  
Bond and Kelly (1955) found that total heat load 
could be reduced  from 30 to 50% with a well -
designed shade  and w hen cows that shaded 
during the dry period were compared  with  
unshaded controls, the shaded cows  delivered  
calves that were 3.1 kg heavier  and yielded 13.6%  
more milk for  lactation. S hading is thus one of the 
Page 5:
3 
 most easily  implemented and economical 
methods to minimize heat  from solar radiation  
and this is particularly relevant for smallholder 
farmers who tend to be more economically 
constrained.  
Resilient Breeds  
While foreign breeds often exhibit higher 
productivity and greater milk yields, they are also 
notably more vulnerable to the adverse effects of 
climate conditions compared to their local 
counterparts.  The concept of breeding more 
genetically heat -tolerant dairy breeds represents 
a critical strategy in addressing the climate -
induced challenges faced by dairy farmers.  
Dash et al. (2016) asserts that this approach, 
involving the identification, selection, and 
crossbreeding of heat -tolerant dairy animals, 
offers a practical means of maintaining high 
productivity and ensuring the animals' 
survivability under heat stress co nditions. One 
suggested method involves crossbreeding 
between exotic commercial breeds and local 
animals, resulting in animals that exhibit both 
enhanced productivity and resilience to Kenya's 
climatic conditions, as highlighted by  Munywoki  
(2021) . Bekele (2018)  similarly propose s 
identifying and reinforcing local breeds that have 
already adapted to the region's climatic stressors 
and feed sources. Furthermore, these local 
genetics can be improved through crossbreeding 
with heat and disease -tolerant breeds.  
However, Sejian et al. (2015) present an 
alternative perspective, emphasizing the 
pragmatism of utilizing already adapted breeds, 
even if they exhibit slightly lower production 
levels, instead of attempting to introduce 'stress 
tolerance' genes into non -adapted breeds. The 
choice between these approaches must consider 
factors such as the local context, available 
resources, and the long -term sustainability of the 
dairy farming sector.  Overall, a conscious active 
strategy of breeding for resilience would be 
impactful in reducing farmer risks.  Water and Feed Storage  
Addressing the adverse consequences of 
drought is a critical concern for livestock farmers. 
Even a brief, severe drought can cause significant 
animal feed degradation (IVM , 2009). To enhance 
their resilience to such climate impacts, farmers 
can implement sound water and feed/fodder 
storage practices. Storing adequate water 
resources in reserve can help ensure that livestock 
have a continuous supply, even during dry spells.  
Moreover, the strategic storage of high -quality 
feed and fodder, properly conserved and 
shielded from the elements, ensures a reliable 
food source for the animals. Fodder conservation 
practices such as silage pits, hay bans, tube 
silages, and maize stover stores should be 
explored for this purpose (Wetende et al., 2015). 
Farmers also need to develop the habit of feeding 
concentrates, legume forages and improving 
past ure management (Tadesse and Dereje, 
2018).  
Water  and feed  resource  shortage planning 
should be  an integral part of an effective future 
livestock improvement strategy .  These practices 
are fundamental for maintaining the health and 
productivity of livestock, safeguarding their 
overall well -being, and enhancing farmers' ability 
to secure financial support from lending 
institutions.  
Insurance  
At the global level, tools to manage climate risk, 
including well -designed advanced parametric 
financial instruments have been developed, to 
support climate and disaster -risk management in 
the world’s most vulnerable regions (Enenkel et 
al. 2018). These i nnovative climate risk solutions 
are being used  to help smallscale  farmers avoid 
adverse consequences of unpredictable weather 
patterns.   
In Kenya, there are several types of livestock index 
insurance such as the full, partial, and non -
climate -index livestock insurance covers. These 
cover climatic risks such as flooding, heat stress, 
and droughts and non -climatic risks such as 
sickness, theft, accidents, outbreaks/pandemics 
etc. The purpose of these insurance products is to 
Page 6:
4 
 provide a financial safety net for individuals or 
entities vulnerable to risks  and to reduce the risk 
financial institutions face when lending.  
It is even more impactful to explore credit -linked 
insurance schemes, as discussed by Van 
Asseldonk et al. (2022), which offer s crucial 
support to risk -exposed small -scale farmers who 
often lack substantial collateral. By providing 
them with access to commercial agricultural 
credit services and insured input bundles, this 
scheme empowers farmers to confront and adapt 
to the challe nges posed by adverse climate 
variations and extreme weather events, ultimately 
enhancing their productivity and resilience.  
Early Warning Information Systems  Tailored for 
Smallholder Dairy Farmers  
Early warning systems are instrumental in 
enhancing the resilience of dairy farmers in Kenya 
to the growing threats of climate impacts. These 
systems provide farmers with timely, accurate, 
and location -specific information on weather 
patterns, rainfall forecasts, and potential climate -
related risks  (Tadesse and Dereje, 2018) .  
Armed with this knowledge, farmers can make 
informed decisions regarding their dairy 
management practices.  Early warning systems, in 
particular, can alert farmers to imminent weather -
related challenges such as droughts, heatwaves, 
or heavy rains  (Wetende et al., 2015) . This 
advanced notice allows them  act by  taking 
proactive measures, such as adjusting feeding 
schedules, providing additional shade, or 
securing additional water sources for their cattle  
(Kimaro and Toribio, 2015) . It also facilitates more 
effective disease management and prevention, as 
some diseases become more prevalent during 
specific weather conditions.  Moreover, these 
systems can help dairy farmers implement 
climate -smart agricultural practices.  
By tailoring their strategies to the expected 
weather conditions, they can optimize milk 
production, maintain the health of their cattle, and 
minimize economic losses. In this way, 
information and early warning systems serve as 
vital tools for building res ilience among dairy farmers, enabling them to thrive in a climate -
vulnerable environment.  
Way Forward  
Smallholder dairy farmers in Africa, particularly 
Kenya, face significant climatic challenges, 
impacting both their agricultural productivity and 
economic stability.  Development of a climate -
conscious credit scoring system under the 
Climate Resilience Initiative  and Livestock and 
Climate initiative , can help in addressing many of 
these challenges. This system incorporates 
adaptation strategies into credit assessments, 
aiding farmers in gaining access to financial 
services and enabling lenders to better 
understand climate -related risks.  The taxonomy 
of adaptation measures presented in this brief 
help in identifying and benchmarking the most 
used  adaptation strategies by farmers based on 
extensive literatur e review.  Key adaptation 
measures such as efficient cooling and heat 
management, breeding resilient cattle, 
optimizing water and feed storage, innovative 
insurance solutions, and leveraging information 
systems are instrumental in enhancing the 
resilience of the dair y sector. These measures are 
embedded into the overall credit scoring system 
and help in scoring and tracking farm 
management practices (based on their 
adaptation potential).  
Moving forward, a collaborative approach is 
essential. Governments, financial institutions, 
researchers, and farmers need to work together 
to ensure these strategies are accessible and 
practical. Particular attention should be paid to 
the needs of marginalized and underserved 
communities within the farming sector, ensuring 
equitable access to resources and training. 
Ongoing capacity building, education, and 
research will adapt and refine these strategies as 
environmental conditions and farming practices 
evolve.  The role of technology and digital 
solutions in facilitating these adaptations should 
be further explored and utilized.

Climate  change is bringing increasingly variable weather 
and more frequent floods and droughts to low- and middle-
income countries. If these nations are to adapt to such changes 
in the medium- to long-term, they must undertake a range 
of actions. First, they must develop evidence-based, cross-
sectoral adaptation plans and policies – including those required to fulfil the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process 
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) – at a range of scales and in collaboration 
with diverse departments and organizations. Second, they 
need to implement projects to minimise the impacts of climate 
change, and to monitor their effectiveness so they can evaluate 
progress towards meeting the mitigation and adaptation plans 
they develop, as well as global development goals. And third, 
they have to identify gaps where additional funding and effort 
are required.
Fulfilling these activities can be challenging because national-
level initiatives are often not coordinated with ground-level 
institutions; data on climate-related hazards and communities’ 
exposure and vulnerability levels is not available; and effort 
is frequently duplicated because of a lack of awareness of 
existing initiatives. The Climate Smart Governance (CSG) 
Dashboard is designed to resolve these challenges, including 
by support ing nations to develop robust NAPs. The first tool 
of its kind, it gathers together data on a range of variables – 
including past and future climate, and societal characteristics 
– and combines this with tools for planning investments, 
reporting and monitoring climate adaptation projects, and 
evaluating progress towards meeting the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The CSG Dashboard has been developed as part of the CGIAR 
Initiative on Climate Resilience (ClimBeR). Specifically, it is part 
of efforts to ‘build capacity for policies that match local needs 
with available tools to promote “governance for resilience” 
(G4R) that operates effectively across multiple levels and 
scales.’ This aim complements other goals of the Program, 
which seek to: reduce risk to food-producers’ livelihoods and 
agricultural value chains; ensure policymakers have evidence 
on which to base robust policies; and to understand and

act on security risks posed by climate change. The ClimBeR 
Program is being implemented in Zambia, Morocco, Senegal, 
Philippines, Guatemala, Kenya and Sri Lanka.

The CSG dashboard is designed to be installed in a range 
of institutions – from government departments to financing 
organizations and humanitarian agencies. It comprises nine 
modules designed to underpin effective climate adaptation 
planning. These are:
Module 1 – Country Overview
This module provides a snapshot of a country’s water 
resources, agriculture, ecosystems, health and climate hazards 
(flood, drought, tsunami, landslide and cyclone), giving an 
indication of its level of vulnerability to climate hazards.
Module 2 – Climate Outlook
This uses the UNFCCC Shared Socioeconomic Pathways to 
show how the nation’s level of risk may change under different 
climate policies, and across different regions. Users can click on 
a particular region and explore forecast predictions for climate 
variables, such as temperature and precipitation. 
Module 3 – Project Tracker
Users of the CSG Dashboard add information on projects via 
this module. Data is added under set categories to provide: 
project name, description, duration; country; donor; type of 
hazard being addressed; scale of the work (such as basin, 
subnational, global); theme (including fisheries, climate 
resilience, disaster risk reduction); and approach (such as 
monitoring and evaluation, innovation and scaling, capacity 
building). The Tracker then showcases all the climate-mitigation 
and -adaptation projects that have been added (dating 
back five years). This data can be presented on maps ¬and 
interrogated via the other CSG Dashboard tools.
Module 4 – Geospatial Tools
This module can help policymakers to identify locations in 
need of support and to understand the kinds of projects 
that could most benefit communities living there. Various 
layers of information can be overlaid on a map, including: 
infrastructure (such as roads, towns, schools and hospitals); 
exposure to climate hazards (including floods and droughts); 
male and female literacy levels; access to toilets; and hygiene 
levels. Projects listed on the dashboard can also be mapped. 
Policymakers can use the tool to identify regions in need of 
financial support, direct development projects to those regions 
and identify the type of interventions that are most needed and 
lacking in the area.  
Module 5 – Monitoring and Evaluation
Information uploaded to the Project Tracker includes the type 
of hazard being addressed and the particular adaptation Climate Smart Governance Dashboard Landing Page.

activities being undertaken. As the number of projects added 
to the dashboard grows, this data can be mapped to show 
the spatial distribution of projects concerned with particular 
aspects of adaptation. And, as project managers upload 
updates, the projects’ collective outcomes can be assessed 
against national adaptation objectives. As well as enhancing 
accountability and transparency, the module can be used to 
assess transformational change in the long-term.
Module 6 – Development Indicators
This module is designed to facilitate understanding of 
a country’s progress towards meeting the UN SDGs. 
When individual projects are listed, dashboard users add 
information on the specific SDGs they intend to address. 
This guides monitoring and evaluation teams on where to 
undertake surveys to assess changes in SDG indicators, by 
which progress towards meeting targets is measured. Data                    
accumulated from many projects can help highlight a nation’s 
achievements towards meeting the SDGs. For example, 
following implementation of a project that is aiming to reduce 
poverty (Target 1-1), participants can be surveyed to see how 
many are living on less than USD1.25 (Target 1-1 indicator)      
and how that number has changed since before the                                                                                                                 
project started. 
Module 7 – Adaptation Catalogue 
This module showcases the climate-mitigation and adaptation 
projects from around the world that have been uploaded to 
the Project Tracker. Anyone who has signed up to the system 
can upload information about projects they are working on, 
with this information then becoming visible to all other users 
of the system. In time, the dashboard may be made available 
more widely, so that members of smaller enterprises and the 
public can also upload information on initiatives. Projects can 
be viewed on a map, to show where clusters of similar initiatives 
or gaps exist.
Module 8 – Investment Portfolio Planning
This module provides an overview of a country, detailing the 
mainstays of its economy and the risks presented by climate 
change. A climate-risk rank is given, using data from SwissRe 
outlining the potential impacts on GDP under different 
temperature-rise scenarios, the risk from specific weather 
hazards and the nations’ adaptive capacity. An assessment is 
also provided on the impacts of climate change on specific 
sectors or aspects of the environment, including tourism, crop 
yields, health, sea-level rise and heat stress. Policymakers can 
use the module as the basis for analysis to assess the potential 
financial impacts of climate change within their country and use 
this evidence to attract investment from donors.

• Project managers for an international WASH organisation use 
the Geospatial Tools to identify areas that have low access

WASH projects exist. They then establish toilet-building and 
hygiene education programmes in those locations, adding 
details of each project to the dashboard.
• Staff in a finance department use the Investment Portfolio 
Planning tool to assess their country’s level of risk from 
climate change. On noting that they face a particularly 
high threat from sea-level rise and, potentially, associated 
reductions in tourism and GDP , they approach a development 
bank for funding to finance coastal defence work. 
• A national disaster risk reduction center uses the               
Climate Outlook tool to identify parts of their country at high 
risk from flooding. They use this information, along with 
infrastructure data mapped using the Geospatial Tools, to 
identify schools that can act as emergency relief centres for 
people who have to be evacuated. They incorporate this into

in the medium- to long-term. The CSG Dashboard brings these 
entities together, provides critical data and analytical tools 
to underpin mitigation and adaptation planning, facilitates 
monitoring of progress towards national and global goals, and 
highlights knowledge and investment gaps.

The CGIAR Initiative on Climate Resilience (ClimBeR) aims to 
do just this. ClimBeR works with a diverse range of partners 
to transform the climate adaptation capacity of food and 
agricultural systems in low- and middle-income countries, 
reduce vulnerability to climate change at its roots, and support 
countries to adapt and build equitable and sustainable 
futures. The Initiative also aims to empower women, youth, 
and underrepresented groups through multilevel polycentric 
governance – one of four workstreams which sit under its 
Governance for Resilience (G4R) research area.
The Governance for Resilience (G4R) work-streams utilize relevant 
frameworks to improve horizontal and vertical coordination, 
enable responsiveness to climate shocks, facilitate long-term 
planning for adaptation, and nurture champions of change 
across local communities to achieve transformative impact. Local smallholder communities who are often hit the hardest                           
by climate change, will have greater agency through stronger 
representation in decision-making on climate adaptation 
solutions. Local leadership in planning and implementation 
of climate adaptation interventions builds stronger and more 
resilient communities with effective, efficient, just, and sustainable 
solutions to climate-related challenges. 
ACTION for resilience ACTION for resilience 
ClimBeR’s Loc Ally led Climate adap Tation Champ ION  
(ACTION) Grant Program focuses on interventions that 
are driven and implemented at the local level, with the  
involvement and leadership of community members, 
organizations, and local governments. These interventions 
are tailored to the specific needs, priorities, and context of the 
community and aim to build resilience against the impacts 
of climate change. The ACTION Grant Program identifies 
rewarding, inspiring and sustainable local innovations that can 
be scaled through knowledge sharing among communities 
and within polycentric governance structures of governments 
and other support agencies for transformative adaptation to 
climate extremes.
The selection and implementation of locally led climate 
adaptation methods, as part of the ACTION include the 
following:
1. Identify  specific climate-related challenges that the 
community faces, such as extreme weather events, floods, 
droughts, or increased temperatures.
2. Conduct a vulnerability assessment to determine which 
communities or smallholder farmers are most at-risk 
and identify the areas that require the most attention, 
as prioritized by the communities. Data collection and 
engaging with local stakeholders in a participatory 
diagnosis of current and future impacts of climate change 
also needs to be a part of this process.

3. Co-create a plan with the community, including 
marginalized women and men, that is tailored to specific 
needs and local contexts, to better adapt to the identified 
risks and build resilience. This includes a wide range of 
possible interventions (see Box 1). 
4. Provide appropriate technical, financial and              
institutional support and community contributions, to 
facilitate communities’ implementation of the adaptation 
plan through partnerships with local government, 
organizations and other stakeholders.
5. Undertake regular monitoring and evaluation of the 
project’s progress and impacts on health, nutrition,     income and other livelihood dimensions and adjust the 
strategies as needed to ensure that the intended goals          
are met.
The upscaling and institutionalization of polycentric 
governance requires the widespread sharing of knowledge, 
such as lessons learned and best practices. Doing so helps 
meet the clear demand for increased horizontal cooperation 
across sectors and vertical coordination from local to 
national and international scales and vice versa, among 
local actors, public and private sectors. This in turn creates 
greater commitment and mobilizes more resources for local 
adaptation priorities and resilience building.

1. ZAMBIA: COMMUNITY-LED SOLAR-POWERED 
BOREHOLE FOR WATER-RESILIENCE
ACTION is catalyzing community-led climate adaptation 
in the Hanzila community of the Monze district in Southern 
Zambia, in collaboration with local authorities. Figure 1 
shows the generic stepwise planning process that is followed                                             
(van Koppen et al. 2020).1. Build green infrastructure: This involves planting trees and vegetation, creating green spaces, and promoting natural 
drainage systems to reduce the risk of flooding and improve air quality. Green infrastructure also offers benefits such as 
shade, cooling, and habitat for wildlife.
2. Promote sustainable climate-smart agriculture: This includes using sustainable farming practices, such as crop and 
nutritional diversification, conservation tillage, and water management, to reduce the impacts of drought, flooding, and 
other climate-related challenges on food production.
3. Develop early warning systems: This involves creating and implementing systems to detect and respond to weather and 
climate-related hazards, such as floods, storms, and heatwaves. Early warning systems can help communities prepare    
and respond to disasters more effectively.
4. Provide climate-smart energy solutions: Promoting the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, 
and fostering energy-efficient practices can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce energy costs.
5. Create community-based disaster risk reduction plans: This involves engaging with community members and local 
organizations to develop plans for responding to and recovering from disasters such as floods, storms, and wildfires. 
These plans can help reduce the risk of loss of life and property damage during disasters. 
6. Improving community-based water tenure for enhanced and sustainable resilience: This involves the provision of 
a reliable water source during the dry season, and protection against floods and storms. This improves health and               
well-being, reduces food insecurity, and promotes economic development. The use of groundwater — the planet’s      
largest storage — can be particularly effective.Box 1.  Examples of locally led climate adaptation   interventions in ACTION.

Step 1: Initiating Collaboration 
The site selected is prone to some severe climate change 
impacts, i.e., droughts and floods. Together, community 
members, including men, women, and children, collaborate 
with ACTION facilitators and local government representatives, 
who explain the outcome of the community selection process 
and the broad scope of ACTION’s mandate. The mandate 
is to address climate change related challenges by helping 
communities enhance their adaptive capacities within broad 
project timelines established to   achieve such goals.
The need for sustainable water solutions can immediately 
emerge as a priority, during such initial conversations. Year-
round and nearby access to water to meet multiple needs 
(domestic, livestock, irrigation, and other uses) is typically 
limited, especially in the dry season. The ACTION initiative 
explicitly takes an integrated climate-related approach that 
considers every interconnected surface and groundwater 
resource and all intersecting livelihood-enhancing uses. This 
differs from conventional sectoral approaches, where one 
sector may focus on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, and others 
may exclusively look at crop irrigation, etc.
In line with the rural water supply development guidelines 
endorsed by the local authority, the community members commit to nominate a transparent and inclusive water 
committee to guarantee the community benefits, including   
that of marginalized groups, and any water related 
infrastructure will be maintained. The water committee will 
comprise of an equal number of men and women (Ministry of 
local government, 2010).
Step 2: Diagnosis 
Group discussions and a participatory resource mapping 
process enable communities to recount how they currently 
access and tap into surface and groundwater sources as well as 
the construction and operation of any available infrastructure 
(both collectively and individually; both self-financed and 
externally supported) to meet their multiple domestic and 
productive needs. They also document challenges, including 
those of increasing climate variability, such as conflict during 
drought. The shared insights on communities’ water tenure 
highlights how they already mobilize their social, natural, 
technical, financial and institutional capital to ensure that the 
existing water resources contribute to health, nutrition, food 
security, income generation, and cultural and spiritual views on 
water and climate but can also bring about risk of flooding and 
damage (Mweemba et al. 2022).

Page 4:
Step 3: Envisioning Solutions
Potential solutions are identified to resolve existing 
challenges, based on holistic diagnosis through community 
conversations. Emerging solutions are ranked and prioritized. 
In Zambia, this is akin to the formal procedure for rural water 
supply development implemented by the local authority. 
Communities are required to apply for water supply projects 
with a provisional plan that underscores the types of access to 
be enhanced through water infrastructure.   
In Hanzila, the priority is for a multi-purpose water  
infrastructure that promotes water-resilient climate risk 
management for safe domestic water uses, to especially 
reduce the burden on women and girls, encourage climate-
smart agriculture, and crop and nutritional diversification to 
enhance adaptive capacities. For the prioritized solution, the 
community defines a broad action plan to sustainably adapt to 
climate variability and change. The plan includes commitments 
to obligations for post-construction maintenance, in cash       
and/or kind. 
Boreholes that are powered by solar energy reduce the 
need for fossil fuel-based pumping systems. This reduces 
greenhouse gas emissions and helps communities adapt to  
the impacts of climate change. However, capital costs are high 
and fund mobilization depends on the next step. 
Step 4: Fitting the Financial Framework
In the Hanzila community, the ACTION Grant Program 
collaborates with local authorities and pursues funding 
opportunities to respond to the community-identified plan. 
Broad bills of quantities and other requisites required to 
construct the water infrastructure required are ascertained 
and budgeted. In addition, water network requirements 
and volumes to meet all competing needs are assessed to 
ensure adequate support for all users. Finally, all determined 
and budgeted requirements are presented to ACTION 
for financial support. Contractors commit to collaborating 
with communities and key local experts to design water 
infrastructure to sustain domestic and productive uses and 
needs at the community level.
Step 5:  Implementation
Implementation starts with detailed design. Communities 
collectively agree on preferred sites to implement the water 
infrastructure identified. These sites should be accessible, 
particularly for those marginalized members. Most importantly, 
clarity is provided on all entitled users who have access rights 
to the water infrastructure. Infrastructure, therefore, should 
be accessible through land open for all people. Public-owned 
land should preferably be used for public water infrastructural 
projects. However, where no public land is available for this 
purpose, private individuals willing to part ways with pieces of 
land for public use, should sign over their personal claims to 
the land where the water infrastructure and related network systems are implemented. The winning contractors further 
advise communities on water resource availability at the 
preferred site and other technical features and choices of 
planned infrastructure and its reticulation. This results in a 
detailed technical design. 
The subsequent stage involves procuring materials for the 
construction and implementation of the type of infrastructure, 
wherever possible locally, to strengthen connections between 
the local community and vendors such as hardware shops. 
The construction is implemented by community members 
where possible, either voluntarily or at a modest remuneration. 
Participation improves technical understanding and capacities 
and helps instill further local ownership. 
Experts from the local authority supervise infrastructure 
development to ensure that, technically, the structure             
meets the needs for drinking, domestic and productive               
uses and aligns with what is agreed upon and identified in          
the contract.
Step 6.  Using infrastructure 
As community members use water for various needs, local 
government carries out routine monitoring of the usage of 
water infrastructure to ensure that the agreed-upon plans 
and milestones align with implementation plans. Where      
variances are noted, strategies are adjusted as needed to            
meet project goals.
Water that is used for drinking (3 L per person per day) may be 
contaminated. Boreholes often provide a more reliable source 
of clean water for communities, reducing the need to rely on 
surface water sources that may be contaminated or unreliable 
due to climate-related changes in precipitation patterns. 
Where surface water sources dry up due to droughts or cannot 
be accessed due to excessive flooding, local conflict resolution 
arrangements can help.
2. KENYA: INTEGRITY IN CLIMATE ADAPTATION
In Kenya, the ACTION initiative is implemented in collaboration 
with the Water Integrity Network and focuses on an ongoing 
climate adaptation intervention — the Namanga Dam Water 
Supply Project in Kajiado County — as implemented by the 
Government of Kenya. In this region, the rapidly expanding 
Maasai communities suffer from persistent droughts, leading 
to massive illness and death of livestock. In vertical polycentric 
governance (see Figure 2), the national government has started 
the construction of a large water supply dam, as Step 5 of the 
generic planning framework (Figure 1). However, as found in 
the ClimBeR assessment of community-scale water tenure in 
Kajiado during 2022, rural communities fear that the local lines 
will be disrupted or destroyed because of the construction of 
the dam. They are worried that they cannot afford the fees and 
will have no say in the management of the water. 
 December 2023  |  Locally Led Climate Action for Sustainable Community Resilience   4
Page 5:
The 2023 study traces the involvement of the communities 
in establishing contacts and communication points with 
inhabitants of Kajiado (Step 1), the degree of participation, 
transparency or accountability in the diagnosis (Step 2), 
the envisioning of solutions and potential alternatives to a 
dam (Step 3), and fund allocation and the tender process of 
consultants and contractors (Step 4). The implications of this 
type of polycentric governance for year-round access to water for rural Maasai communities, their livestock and some farmers’ 
irrigation and wildlife in upstream forests, are then assessed.
This study aligns with the collaborative WIN - COST 
Infrastructure Transparency Initiative. The Initiative is one of 
the first of global action that seeks to disentangle polycentric 
decision-making during the crucial early planning, design and 
fund allocation steps in climate adaptation interventions.Figure 2.  Community participation in vertical polycentric governance.

3. SRI LANKA: REDUCING CLIMATE AND DISASTER 
RISK USING NATURE-BASED FLOOD MITIGATION 
SOLUTIONS
In Sri Lanka, frequent floods induced by extreme weather 
conditions have resulted in considerable economic and 
social losses in recent years. In collaboration with the Disaster 
Management Centre, World Vision, Mayfield Tea Estate, local 
government as well as disaster management committees to 
provide flood protection and prevention to local communities 
as well as infrastructure from floods and landslide events, 
the ACTION grant supports flood prone communities in the 
town of Hatton which lies in the Nuwara Eliya District of Sri 
Lanka’s Central Province, with the development of a local 
Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) plan to improve drainage, river restoration, and green infrastructure for flood prevention and        
protection. This is an essential step in building resilience to 
climate-related hazards within the community.
The nature-based flood mitigation solutions to 
be implemented by local communities and other 
stakeholders not only provide effective flood control 
but also multiple co-benefits, such as improved water 
quality, enhanced biodiversity, reduced tea plantation 
production losses, livelihood resilience and climate change 
adaptation. By integrating these approaches into flood                             
management strategies, communities can enhance their 
resilience to climate-related hazards while promoting 
sustainable and ecologically friendly practices, that also

ecosystem services.
RecommendationsRecommendations
It is evident from current global climate finance dissemination 
practices that only a small proportion of resources are channeled 
to the local level, with an even smaller share provisioned to locally 
designed and locally led initiatives. There is a clear disconnect 
between the spaces where climate risk is greatest and where 
climate adaptation funding is allocated. The CGIAR Climate 
Resilience Initiative’s efforts aim to foster an unprecedented 
scaling-up of locally led climate adaptation actions to prevent 
and reduce climate-related disaster impacts and build community-level climate resilience. The ACTION-led solutions in 
three countries summarizes 10 key recommendations for locally 
led adaptation in a holistic and participatory approach that gives 
communities agency and access.
1. Community Engagement:  Engage with local communities 
to understand their specific needs, vulnerabilities, and 
priorities. Involve them in the decision-making process and 
ensure that their voices are heard in the development of 
adaptation strategies.

Improve access to climate information and early          
warning systems at the local level. Provide timely and 
accurate weather forecasts and practice drills to help 
communities prepare for extreme events.
3. Knowledge Sharing:  Promote knowledge sharing and 
learning between communities. Encourage the exchange 
of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned     
from other regions and communities.
4. Capacity Building:  Build the capacity of local 
communities, including training and education on climate 
change impacts, adaptation options, and sustainable 
practices. Strengthen local institutions and organizations to 
support adaptation efforts.
5. Inclusivity and Equity:  Ensure that locally led adaptation

Locally led climate action has emerged as a critical approach Locally led climate action has emerged as a critical approach 
to address the challenges posed by climate change at the to address the challenges posed by climate change at the 
grassroots level. As the impacts of climate change intensify, grassroots level. As the impacts of climate change intensify, 
communities around the world face a wide range of communities around the world face a wide range of 
vulnerabilities such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, vulnerabilities such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, 
rising sea levels, and disruptions to lives and livelihoods. In this rising sea levels, and disruptions to lives and livelihoods. In this 
context, locally led climate action emphasizes the importance context, locally led climate action emphasizes the importance

resilience of local communities to the continued effects of resilience of local communities to the continued effects of 
climate change.climate change.
The CGIAR Initiative on Climate Resilience (ClimBeR) aims to 
do just this. ClimBeR works with a diverse range of partners 
to transform the climate adaptation capacity of food and 
agricultural systems in low- and middle-income countries, 
reduce vulnerability to climate change at its roots, and support 
countries to adapt and build equitable and sustainable 
futures. The Initiative also aims to empower women, youth, 
and underrepresented groups through multilevel polycentric 
governance – one of four workstreams which sit under its 
Governance for Resilience (G4R) research area.
The Governance for Resilience (G4R) work-streams utilize relevant 
frameworks to improve horizontal and vertical coordination, 
enable responsiveness to climate shocks, facilitate long-term 
planning for adaptation, and nurture champions of change 
across local communities to achieve transformative impact. Local smallholder communities who are often hit the hardest                           
by climate change, will have greater agency through stronger 
representation in decision-making on climate adaptation 
solutions. Local leadership in planning and implementation 
of climate adaptation interventions builds stronger and more 
resilient communities with effective, efficient, just, and sustainable 
solutions to climate-related challenges. 
ACTION for resilience ACTION for resilience 
ClimBeR’s Loc Ally led Climate adap Tation Champ ION  
(ACTION) Grant Program focuses on interventions that 
are driven and implemented at the local level, with the  
involvement and leadership of community members, 
organizations, and local governments. These interventions 
are tailored to the specific needs, priorities, and context of the 
community and aim to build resilience against the impacts 
of climate change. The ACTION Grant Program identifies 
rewarding, inspiring and sustainable local innovations that can 
be scaled through knowledge sharing among communities 
and within polycentric governance structures of governments 
and other support agencies for transformative adaptation to 
climate extremes.
The selection and implementation of locally led climate 
adaptation methods, as part of the ACTION include the 
following:
1. Identify  specific climate-related challenges that the 
community faces, such as extreme weather events, floods, 
droughts, or increased temperatures.
2. Conduct a vulnerability assessment to determine which 
communities or smallholder farmers are most at-risk 
and identify the areas that require the most attention, 
as prioritized by the communities. Data collection and 
engaging with local stakeholders in a participatory 
diagnosis of current and future impacts of climate change 
also needs to be a part of this process.

Brachiaria) hybrids. The first hybrid was released in 2001 by Grupo Papalotla, a seed company from Mexico, and since then, hybrid adoption has happened in >70 countries. The impacts this adoption has generated over time are, however, yet largely unknown.

Main problems for emerging  hybrid seed markets
•Access to seed, seed price, seed scarcity
Poor infrastructure, Development of informal seed sector with high shares of vegetative propagation, lost market potential
•Complex process of forage variety registration
Disincentives for seed importers, delays in market development, informal seed sector, lost market potential
•Complexity of hybrid cultivation
Different knowledge and skill set required, extension and technical assistance limited, disincentive for adoption
•Small -scale family farming model
Limited availability of resources for investing in hybrid seed, cultural burdens, different preferences
•High input costs and low milk/beef prices
e.g., fertilizer, disincentive for adoptionFlorez et al. ( under review )

▪GANSO  (short for sustainable livestock farming in 
Spanish, Ganadería Sostenible ) is a technical assistance 
and funding facility developed by created by Climate 
Focus and Alliance of Bioversity -CIAT, that helps farms 
transition from inefficient cattle ranching to sustainable 
and diversified production systems. 
▪Aval GANSO is a voluntary assessment tool that has five 
pillars – Environment, People, Management, animal 
welfare, and beef quality – which group a set of 52 
practices of sustainable cattle production that are 
verified by an independent auditing entity.
▪Aval GANSO enables markets and consumers to play a 
more active role in supporting sustainable livestock 
practices at farm level.GANSO: Advancing sustainable 
livestock farming in Colombia 
through an innovative business 
model and technical assistance•Beef production is a significant contributor to 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions , which leads to 
climate change, deforestation, and a decrease in 
biodiversity.
•With increased awareness of environmental issues, 
socially responsible consumption has emerged as a 
trend, where consumers consider the environmental 
and social impact of the products and services they 
choose in addition to their quality and price.

 Context
Our innovative approach
•In Colombia, the Aval GANSO program offers three 
levels of progress based on the assessment of farm 
management practices and sustainability criteria.
Meat Market in Colombia•GANSO is monitoring approximately 81,500 hectares  
of productive land and close to 7,000 hectares of 
forest for conservation.
•Aval GANSO is applied in the main livestock 
producing regions in Colombia, covering more than 
40,000 hectares of productive land , over 2,000 
hectares of forest for conservation and over 60,000 
animals  under management.
•Beef from the endorsed farms is commercialized by 
Grupo Éxito  in 182 markets and 6 cities , and the 
number of farms working with GANSO has a huge 
growth potential in the coming years.
•This endorsement is applied to the farm and 
recognized in its products, such as meat, sold in 
supermarkets. The price of the product increases 
depending on the level achieved by the farm, 
incentivizing sustainable production practices.
•The cattle producer receives an assessment report of 
his evaluation and GANSO provides technical 
support for continuous improvement of the farm. 
Between 51 and 80 % 
for the assessed 
sustainability practices.Up to 50 % compliance 
for the assessed 
sustainability practices.Over 81 % compliance 
for the assessed 
sustainability practices.

Maize is usually intercropped with a legume (i.e., groundnuts/soya beans/cowpeas/beans). Maize is planted into rip-lines opened in double rows (50cm inter-row x 25cm in-row) and a gap of 130cm is left in-between the maize double rows where legumes will be planted [groundnut (35cm inter-row x 30cm in-row); soya beans (35cm inter-row x 5cm in-row)]Four-row strip cropping: Similar to double row strip cropping above, four rows of maize alternate with four rows of a legume. However, the inter-row spacing of maize is reduced from the usual 90 cm to 45 cm. This narrowing and reduction in size increases growing space for four rows of legumes. Maize is planted into lines spaced at 45 cm inter-row with 4 row strips of maize alternating with another 4 rows strip of soya beans/groundnuts also spaced at 45 cm between rows.  ","432"

In other words, barriers to progress are typically viewed as issues of technology adoption, not as part of the innovation process itself. This study contributes to changing the paradigm by proposing a living lab approach, which considers innovation as an adaptive process where stakeholders co-produce knowledge and collaborate based on inclusivity and empowerment. Our specific concept for this approach is called a Living Lab for People (LL4P). This conceptual paper outlines a framework to guide the development of a LL4P that remains flexible to be adapted for specific sites. While we seek to identify common denominators, we recognize the necessity for such a framework to remain open enough to be adaptable for varied contexts. Consequently, the framework draws on the living lab literature but tailors existing approaches for sustainable food system transformation and puts people (men, women, and marginalized groups among key food system actors) at the center of innovation processes with a clear intention to address power and social inequity. We draw on specific cases in China, Colombia, Kenya and Vietnam as learning grounds for formulating LL4Ps through locally led innovation processes. Based on our learnings and consultations, we define a LL4P as an inclusive and diverse space for people to advance their socio-technical innovation processes and associated modes of governance within a facilitated organizational structure. The principles of LL4Ps include co-production, gender equality and social inclusion, governance and institutional sustainability to advance existing and novel innovation processes. The practical experiences from applying this framework in the four case studies indicate alternative pathways for transforming the food system toward a sustainable and socially equitable trajectory through the establishment of a LL4P.

Coordinated through its Living Labs for People, in collaboration with China Academy of Rural Development of Zhejiang University, School of Economics of Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, and Government of Yuhang District, the CGIAR Research Initiative on Low-Emission Food Systems (Mitigate+) started developing a research-for-impact partnership with the Qingshan Village in 2023. Merged from three small villages, Qingshan Village covers an area of 45.6 km2 and has a registered population of 2,662. The village has three medium-sized reservoirs, with approximately 80% of the land area covered by forests. Bamboo forestry occupies 90% of the village’s agricultural land, with the remaining agricultural land utilized for rice, tea, and vegetable cultivation. In 2022, agricultural production value reached 90 million RMB (US$12.5 million). Bamboo forestry, which encompasses the production of raw materials and bamboo shoots, represents the primary source of agricultural income for many local farmers.

 ABSTRACT  
 
Innovation spaces  are often dominated by linear, top -down approaches, with the transfer of technology 
being  seen as the solution to many problems rather than trying to understand which innovation  processe s 
people are engaging with  themselves.  In other words, barriers to progress are  typically  viewed as issues of 
technology adoption, not as part of the innovation process itself.  This study contributes to changing the 
paradigm  by proposing a living lab approach , which considers innovati on as an adaptive process where 
stakeholders co -produce knowledge and collaborate based on inclusivity  and empowerment . Our specific 
concept for this approach is called  a Living Lab for People (LL4P). This conceptual paper outlines a 
framework to guide the development of a LL4P  that remains flexible  to be adapted for specific sites . 
While we seek to identify common denominators, we recognize the necessity for such a framework to 
remain open  enough  to be adapt able for varied  context s. Consequently, the framework  draws on the living 
lab literature but tailors existing approaches for sustainable food system transformation  and puts people 
(men, women, and marginalized groups  among key food system actors)  at the center  of innovation 
process es with a clear intention to  address power  and social in equity . We draw on  specific cases in China, 
Colombia, Kenya and Vietnam as learning grounds for formulating LL4P s through  locally led  innovation 
processes. Based on our learnings and consultations, we define a LL4P as an inclusive and diverse space 
for people to advance their socio -technical innovation  processe s and associated modes of governance 
within a facilitated organizational structure. The principles of LL4P s include co-production, gender 
equality and social inclusion, governance  and institutional sustainability to advance existing and novel 
innovation  processes . The practical experience s from applying this framework in the four case studies 
indicate  alternative pathways for transforming the food system toward a sustainable  and socially equitable 
trajectory  through the establishment of a LL4P .

 1. Introduction  
Innovation  over time  has become a term with many meanings, but despite  much  more  
differentiated work being done around innovation theories, the more generic , common  
understanding remains that innovation must  have - or be - something new and  emanate  from 
somewhere else. This suggests that innovation is “a thing”, and that there is a differentiation 
between the people who can come up with innovations  – the innovators  – and the ones who 
are supposed to adopt these innovations on the receiving end  – the “beneficiaries ”. The latter is  
a term used with the implication that there is somehow a presumed benefactor supporting the 
people subsumed under this term “beneficiary”, who  are people  in need of support,  and in 
somewhat dire circumstances, often accompanied by images of poverty (Bhati, 2023) . These 
images originat e at a time where colonial structures and thinking were still prevalent and often 
not openly challenged . More recently,  however  the need for  decoloniality of international 
research , NGOs  and development studies has been discussed intensively, though the focus of 
the discussion remains in Northern  higher education  institutions (Biekart  et al. , 2024; Melber  et 
al., 2024) . Decoloniality however becomes a must for all involved, if we want to pursue a path 
that overcomes the consequences of imposed structural adjustments to poorer economies, and 
other negative consequences of an expanding unilateral world order and certain c oncepts of 
worldviews, economic and political thinking as well as societal norms and framings that are 
imposed or infused into comparatively less powerful parts of the World (Melber et al., 2024) .  
An institutional shift within the CGIAR to ‘decolonize’ agricultural  research is under debate 
(Gewin 2022) . Concretely , for an organization like the CGIAR , this would mean that the 
structures, the people in charge, the strategies, and the goals and modalities of their work need 
to be determined by the societies they operate in, and not entities like donors, international 
organizations and governments rooted in another, more powerful part of the world. It means 
not only giving more visibility to national researchers, in decolonizing through authorship and 
representation, but also  giving space for alternative way s of knowing and thinking (Gewin, 2022; 
Habermann, 2014) . In reality though, many international organizations still perpetuate a more 
traditional approach  with  a linear, and top -down oriented thinking of how  development and  
innovation work  – but more recently, there  are attempts  both from the outside and from within  
to question this framing and to introduce alternative views  (Crane, 2014; Glover, Sumberg, Ton, 
Andersson, & Badstue, 2019; Habermann et al., 2022; Habermann, Vogl, Mekonnen, Bekele, & 
Felt, 2021; Woltering & Boa -Alvarado, 2021; Woltering et al., 2022) . More generally, there are 
many calls to heed a more intersectional approach to research and research methodologies: an 
approach that considers the interplay of race, gender, nation or class in granting or not granting 
legitimacy to different ways of knowin g in order to “avoid reproducing asymmetries of power 
that are too often left unquestioned even by progressive ideologies .” (Malllard, Eggel, & Galvin, 
2021, p. 1) . 
The current global food system has manifold social, economic,  and environmental 
shortcomings. Corporate control, excessive Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, inequality , price 
Page 7:

 instability , poor diet , and food insecurity are just a select few problems that define the current 
food system  (Béné, 2022; McMichael, 2009, 2013; Webb et al., 2020) . Innovation is often 
considered as a driver of food system transformation . Innovation on its own however will not 
deliver  a sustainable, low -emission food system  (Béné, 2022) . A much more radical re -thinking 
of how we can achieve a food systems transformation is needed (Béné, 2022)  . 
[…] while innovation is often presented as a ‘game -changer’, we show how the current 
profit -driven nature of its evolutionary selection creates a random, adirectional, process 
incapable of steering food systems towards sustainability. We argue that unless those 
different issues are tackled all together in a resolutely normative, global, and prescriptive 
manner in which science would have a new role to play, there are serious risks that the 
Great Transformation will not happen . (Béné, 2022:7)   
When dealing with complex challenges, decision -making on food systems transformation 
requires an approach based on co -production : Co-production is not merely a process of joint 
data collection, it is a multi -stakeholder process that requires documentation and analysis of 
social processes, which then helps to foster collective socio -technical change, and  a shared 
understanding of  what prevents this kind of change to happen (Akpo  et al. , 2014) . Such 
processes integrate  diverse participants,  the best available knowledge, and reconcile their 
values and preferences, as well as creati ng ownership  – nevertheless they can be time -
consuming, costly and opposed by some who believe this to be at the expense of scientific rigor 
(Neef, 2008; Neef & Neubert, 2010; Norström et al., 2020) . Part of this paradigm means going 
beyond the dominant technology transfer where the innovator hands over a developed 
technology to a recipient  for adoption  (Glover, Sumberg, & Andersson, 2016) . We challenge this 
dominant paradigm that pits the binary of  users and technologies  in separate domains as the 
process of innovation  by engag ing with stakeholders who value transformative change . We 
propose  a future where we address wicked problems with  complex, flexible and responsive 
approaches that provide space s for citizens to be visionaries for their own future food systems. 
Wicked problems can be problems associated with climate change ; they are called wicked 
problems due to their complex and uncertain nature, and the interdependencies that 
characterize them (Davies  et al. , 2015) . 
A framework for  innovation that has gotten increas ing attention over the last decade is the 
concept of Living Labs (LLs) . LLs are part of a broader  method of  participatory action research 
and experimentation . LLs facilitate  collaborative research environments with numerous 
participants that center their experience and knowledge in the innovation process.  The concept  
has developed from  different  co-participatory research process  developments  that have 
increased the level of engagement of actors in research  through time. Under the approach 
stakeholders change from being adopters  of technologies from the ‘outside’  to co -developers 
and decision -makers  of the actions developed because of  this research . LLs are open 
environments or spaces where innovation takes place in real -world settings. The approach is to 
take experimentation and innovation out of the formal, controlled ‘laboratory’ environment and 
Page 8:
3 
 into the real world1. Most innovation and scaling happen  in projects that create controlled and 
enabling contexts in which it is hard for innovations to fail  until they face real life conditions : 
these pilot environments do not reflect the real -world conditions  (Woltering  et al. , 2019) . The 
knowledge gap is then how to support  so-called  real conditions in real life  so that it addresses 
not only the challenges innovation will face, but also responds to the needs and interests of the 
relevant stakeholders that will be part of the development and scaling of this innovations in the 
long -term.  
The concept and development of LLs has grown markedly over the past decade or so. Literature 
on LLs typically credits William J. Mitchell, a Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and 
Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as the first one to use the term  in 
the 1990s , although some trace the concept back to 1749  (see Leminen & Westerlund, 2019) . At 
the most basic level, LLs are spaces where open innovation and co -creation occur by centering 
“users” (and their experiences) within everyday environments, commonly referred to as “real 
world settings” (Steen & van Bueren, 2017) . Understanding who the “user” is and which role 
“users” are playing in a LL is an often neglected issue: our understanding follows critical Science 
and Technology Studies (STS) where technologies are recognized to respond to the fluidity of 
the social context they are embedded in  (Akrich, 1992, 1993; Glover et al., 2016) . This leads us 
to look at a whole set of framings, narratives and powerful agendas not openly discussed with 
people as potential “users” or “clients” of technologies, but also innovation systems or 
innovation processes (Cornwall & Gaventa, 2001; Glover et al., 2016; Oudshoorn & Pinch, 2003) . 
This neglects the frequent observation that “the practice of new methods, use of new tools and 
learning of new techniques is a multidimensional process that involves learning through 
observation, reflection, selection, experimentation,  and adaptation. It involves much more than 
simply unpacking a technology package and ‘plugging it in’ or 'switching it on' .” (Glover & 
Sumberg, 2016).  
Thus , if we talk about “users” in the context of a living lab  they are acting on behalf of their 
interest, who can also “re -inscribe” their own visions into the living lab  (Akrich, 1992) : the 
design laid out (by the designers, often scientists or technology developers) “inscribes” a certain 
vision into a technology, or a social process. This vision is then often “described” by the users. 
The original idea of the designers becomes displace d by a new script developed by the users – a 
technology designed for one purpose may then be used for another purpose the designers had 
never thought of themselves (Akrich, 1992) . The same can apply to social processes, institutions 
and even organizations: u sers can change , and they can instigate change. Users are not only 
people  waiting to be given, to be taught, they have their own agency and drive to transform 
how they are being governed, what technologies they are offered to use, or told to use, how to 
self-organi ze. Users are not just receivers , they have their own visions of how to live in a food 
 
1 What we mean by the “real world” refers to settings where most, if not all, factors are not directly controlled for 
the purposes of scientific experimentation. These settings stand in contrast to laboratory settings where 
instruments and techniques are used to control for factors that could change results for scientific experi mentation.

 system, how to govern a food system. Therefore, we seek to shift the focus of living labs to the 
user as the central agent of change in transformative innovation processes.  
To better understand how others integrate and position users in their living labs, w e conducted 
a critical review2 (Grant & Booth, 2009)  of the academic and grey literature on living labs . The 
review  helped us  to identify the state of knowledge on the concept and gaps in theory and 
practice. We drew  four conclusions from  living lab  literature  which are highly relevant for the 
design of LL4P s: 1) living labs have only recently been applied to  sustainable food system 
transformation 2) a vast majority of living labs are in the European or North American context ; 
3) living labs often lack an explicitly focus on delivering benefits for participants; 4) living labs 
implementation pays insufficient  attention to address ing issues of power and equity  in multi -
actor spaces . To respond to all these shortcomings, we have developed a novel  approach we call 
a Living Lab for People (LL4P). For our own work, we understand innovation as an open concept 
for a process where innovation can be as much a social process and a way of working together 
as it can be a change in production or a mere product  – it is about a space, virtual or physical,  
where  people themselves develop new ways of thinking and doing.  Our understanding is based 
on elevating  the voices of and empowering historically marginalized populations , such as 
women, youth and underrepresented groups , in the process of  food system transformation. 
These are the groups who are disproportionately  affected by the current food system and, as 
such, their perspectives should be valued and reflected in a co -productive approach to 
innovation .  
The LL4P  approach  is inspired by locally led  innovation, in a bottom -up, process and action -
oriented manner. Through such a people -oriented approach, food system transformations will 
not only embody a new mindset with a new set of norms, but also facilitate a change in 
governance  to strengthen local actors and institutions  and address power imbalance . Hence the 
focus is not on products and technical innovations, it is much more on how local actors and 
institutions can work together in the way they  want, and for a future they  want.  
While o ur thinking aligns with the understanding of other related concepts such as agricultural 
innovation systems (AIS) as a network of different kinds of actors from individual to 
organizations, and even companies , there are still noticeable differences . The type of  network 
AIS is addressing comprises institutions and policies in various sectors that facilitate the social 
and economic use of new products, services, processes, and organizational structures. In this 
understanding , the focus is more on the enabling environment and the actors enabling 
innovation to happen. And this is also where its challenge lies: for AIS to work, it needs to 
address sector specific issues around policies and systemic barriers, that have to be solve d more 
on a top -down than grassroots level – while the demand can be expressed from there, the

researched literature and critically evaluated its quality. [it] goes beyond mere description to include degree of 
analysis and conceptual Innovation…” (p. 94)

 solutions are often deeply structural and cannot be solved by locally -led initiatives. (Gutiérrez 
Cano et al., 2023; IFPRI, 2023)   
This is where our suggestion for a LL4P can help fill a critical gap  in the innovation process : our 
focus is on locally led  innovation processes operating , at least initially, within the framework of 
existing  policy  agenda  (i.e., n ational priorities ) that later may  evolve to  influenc ing policy and 
systemic issues on a political level. While these locally led  innovation processes can embed 
specific products or production modalities into their agenda, they can also be innovative modes 
of governance, of working together in groups or networks, and simply in a new approach for 
people to collaborate and come up wit h better ideas and solutions for their own futures.  
This difference also applies to AIS related innovation oriented concepts such as innovation 
platforms  (Schut, L., Kamanda, Sartas, & Leeuwis, 2019) . While they aim to create more 
coherence among different stakeholder groups, their focus is mostly on identifying problems 
and solutions with an innovation objective but often on a higher level than what a LL4P would 
be addressing, because as to their nature  they are embedded in existing governance systems 
that are then also expected to play a part in implementing the solutions – this has in the past 
often created high expectations at the outset, but then innovation platforms rarely survived the 
project pe riods of their initial development (Kaleb & Habermann, 2015) .  
We draw on the “niche innovation concept” (Geels, 2002) , where users have special demands 
and are willing to support emerging innovations  in their different natures . Geels (2002) 
proposes that transformative  change can b e pushed through the development of “niche  
innovations”  that propose alternatives to  the different regimes of the system. Moreover , not 
every niche innovation is transf ormative . There are three transformative ways to innovate   
according to Ghosh  et al.  (2021) : building and nurturing niches, expanding and mainstreaming 
niches, and opening up and unlocking regimes.   
At the same time, the LL4P concept understands that different stakeholders come together with 
their own mental models, interests, knowledge, assets , and power. Therefore, we consider the 
LL4P as an inclusive and diverse  space for people  to co -produce , test, demonstrate and advance 
their socio -technical innovation  processes  and associated modes of governance within a 
facilitated organizational structure  toward a common goal . While technology has been the focus 
of innovation investment by many development org anizations, significantly less attention has 
been paid to social and organizational innovation  processe s to ensur e the inclusiveness and 
equitability of innovation agenda setting and consequently the impact and  sustainability of such 
innovation  processes . In the next section we explain the methods applied to define this 
conceptual framework. We then provid e a review of relevant LL literature  to outline the gaps 
identified above . We then turn to some of the key principles that define the LL4P concept and 
approach. Lastly, we detail the four unique and diverse contexts where LL4Ps are being 
developed.  
2. Methods  
The development of the LL4P  conceptual framework went through several stages. Based on a 
critical review of the LL literature and consultations with national stakeholders, the need  to 
Page 11:
6 
 adapt the conventional LL concept became immediately clear. We realized th ere were some 
shortcomings in a more  conventional LL  approach  for the objectives of our work . A more 
people -oriented approach with a bottom -up perspective was needed to guide the participatory 
action research in four Global South target countries,  China, Colombia, Kenya and Vietnam . This 
approach is part of the CGIAR Research Initiative on Low -Emissions Food Systems also known as 
Mitigate+.   
Based on exchanges with representatives of an existing living lab implemented by a Kenyan and 
a Dutch university , we decided to develop  a more people -oriented approach  with a bottom -up 
perspective . We set up an expert panel that was tasked with the development of a conceptual 
framework for the LL4P concept. We then  conducted  a critical review of the LL literature with a 
specific focus on LLs in the context of food systems/agriculture and developing countries.  The 
papers were identified using Google Scholar and the Web of Science through  individual and 
combinations of keywords, including “living labs”, “agriculture”, “food systems” and 
“sustainability”. Additional literature  was added to the review t hrough snowballing the 
bibliographies of existing academic articles and grey literature . We then analyzed the collection 
of literature by looking for  how they considered issues  of development, inclusiveness, power , 
food systems change and delivering benefits to living lab participants.  
Additionally, internal reflections were  carried out among scientists involved in the project, using  
semi -structured questionnaire informed by the four dimensions  of key characteristics  of LLs 
(Steen & van Bueren, 2017) : aim, activities, participants, and context. Such deliberate, 
structured reflection exercise provided important insights on  the alternative framings in 
response to the contextual differences of the sites that influence how each LL should shape up.  
Based on these insights, we then proposed a definition for LL4P and collated a set of normative  
principles, noting how they interrelatedly contribute to the overall design and implementation 
of the concept  for innovations for sustainable  food system  transformation . The next section 
provides an overview o f the findings from this process.   
3. Literature Review  
In the literature reviewed, we found that t here are several key features that distinguish LLs 
from other research and innovation discourses . It is important to note that many  initiatives are 
called LLs, but in this paper we consider living labs to be iterative collaborative platforms 
involving co -creation and experimentation by various  actors from research, government and 
business, and citizens, working together in a real life context  (Bouwma et al., 2022) .  
First, in literature  LLs are characterized by a strong focus on “user ” involvement and co -
production. Users are perceived not as  passive subjects of research, but as being  actively 
engaged in the design, development, and evaluation of new ideas and/or technologies. 
Second ly, LLs are typically characterized by an open and collaborative approach to innovation. 
Rather than innovation being the sole responsibility of experts , LL’s encourage open 
Page 12:
7 
 collaboration between diverse groups of people who may or may not  be dividing into different 
groups according to their needs or stake in the process.  Third ly, LLs are designed to be  
conducted in so -called “real -world” settings, which allows participants  to test and validate new 
ideas in an ostensibly more realistic socially, ecologically , and economically valid context. This 
enables in situ innovation to be driven by LL participants, which helps  to co-develop better 
suited solutions  and to identify any unintended consequences or other effects.  We define 
stakeholders as the actors and institutions with an interest in the LL or affected by its purposes 
and activities, while participants are the actors and institutions actively involved and 
contributing to it.  
There is tremendous diversity amongst the literature and the practice of LLs. One of the most 
cited articles on LLs  (Leminen & Westerlund, 2012)  proposes four broad types of LLs:  
1) utilizer -driven, or the organization or company employing a LL for the purposes of product 
innovation;  
2) enabler -driven, which is typically a LL being used for the purposes of local governments for 
(improvement of) public service delivery;  
3) provider -driven, or universities/research institutions with a specific innovation goal and;  
4) user -driven, or a collective interest in innovation around a theme or common purpose.  
There can certainly be overlap in these four typologies as LLs can be part of a dynamic process 
that changes over time depending on the place, participants or problem. Steen and van Bueren 
(2017)  reviewed literature on LLs to analyze the “defining characteristics of urban living labs” 
which included nine characteristics grouped in four dimensions: 1) aim; 2) activities; 3) 
participants, and 4) context (see table 1).

Ballon and Schuurman (2015)  identified some of the key “cornerstones” that have been 
influential in the conceptual development of the LL over time. The first is “user -driven 
innovation” and the second is the theory on the domestication of information and 
communication technology. Neither of those are particularly novel or important for LL s in the 
case of agriculture and food systems. The narrow focus on “users” assumes that all participants 
are currently or will be using technologies developed or improved by a LL. LLs that focus on 
information and communication technology are also less relevant for agriculture and food 
systems because of the focus on improving existing technological systems , such as mobile 
networks, applications and infrastructure. Ballon and Schuurman’s (2015)  third cornersto","11063"

 Introduction  
RiceAdvice Lite  (RAL) is a decision support tool  developed by AfricaRice based on the results and 
experience gathered from the use of the full Android APP version of RiceAdvice on a large scale 
over the last few years. RiceAdvice Lite provides customized (field -level) recommendations for 
optimal sowing window and fertilizer management for lowland rice (which fertilizers, when and 
how much), and other general good agricultural practices. The recommendation on fertilizer 
application practices indicates the amount of fertilizer sources to be applied at specified times 
to the rice field of a size specified by the user. On-farm validation of th is tool is required before its 
dissemination . The objective of this validation t rial was to  : 
• Evaluate fertilizer guideline obtained from RiceAdvice Lite relative to fertilizer 
management practice in farmers’ rice fields.  
• To compare actual yield , nutrient use efficiencies (N , P) and profit  obtained using 
RiceAdvice Lite  guideline with farmer fertilizer management practice.    
 
Methodology  
 
❖ Experimental design  
The validation trials were conducted in the 2023 dry season in Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, and Nasarawa  
States in Nigeria  under irrigated lowland rice system. The treatments used consisted of 
RiceAdvice Lite and farmers’ practices (Table 1). A total of 140 farmers’ fields were selected in 4 
States based on the environmental cluster map generated. Crop management practices were the 
same in both treatments, except for fertilizer management. The rice variety (FARO 44) was grown 
in all the fields. The tr eatment plot size was 10 m x 10 m.

❖ Data collection 
The data collected inclu ded:  
o Fertilizer application rate  applied  
o Fertilizer cost  
o Paddy rice price  
Page 4:

 o Grain weight & grain moisture content  
o Gross revenue on fertilizer cost  = Gross revenue – total fertilizer cost  
o Profit gain : difference in gross returns above fertilizer cost between RAL and FP  
o N and P use efficiency  (kg/kg N or kg/kg P) = grain yield/N or P fertilizer application rate. 
Results were compared with optimum values used by Arouna et al. (2021)  
Key resul ts 
o In Jigawa, r ice yield was generally higher in RAL resulting in higher profit gain  (Figure 1 -
3). NUE was generally within the optimum range (30 -100 kg/kg)  (Figure 4)   
o In Kano , RAL had a higher  yield, and NUE profit than FP  (Figure 1, 3). NUE in Kano  was 
within the optimum range  (Figure 4) .  However, due to higher actual yield than expected 
one (around 6 t/ha), RAL had higher PUE (out of optimum range)  (Figur e 5) .  
o Yield, profit, NUE, and PUE w ere generally higher in RAL than FP  in Kebbi  (Figure 1 -5). 
However, the yield  level is quite lower than expected yield (e.g. 6 t/ha), resulting in low 
NUE/PUE  (Figure 4,5) .  Need to investigate reasons for low yield and NUE/PUE.  
o In Nasar awa, r ice yield was generally higher in RAL resulting in higher profit gain  (Figure 
1-3). NUE was generally within the optimum range (30 -100 kg/kg)  (Figure 4).  
o The overall r esults are  consistent  across the sites .  
o On average, RiceAdvice Lite increased rice yield, profit, by 26% and 29%, respectively, 
with 89 and 81% of fields having higher values with RiceAdvice Lite.   
o Therefore, we suggest that RiceAdvice Lite can move to next stage - piloting stage for 
irrigated rice systems in West Africa, whereas further testing is needed in rainfed 
systems.  
o RiceAdvice Lite has reached a total of 10702 farmers in Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso, 
with 19% of them being women farmers. 95% of these farmers are from Nigeria  (Figure

Work Package  Enabling environment   Farm Radio International (FRI) and the CGIAR Initiative for Digital Innovation have collaborated 
on the development of an end -to-end, automatic speech recognition pipeline for the transcription, 
translation and analysis of Swahili and Luganda. This task is particularly challenging due to the 
number of languages used by FRI ’s clients, and the limited training data available for speech recog-
nition in African languages. The tool is named ‘Longa’, or ‘Lets chat’ in Swahili. Longa will be 
used to answer the surfeit of phone calls currently being received from small -holder farmers asking 
questions about radio programs which FRI do not presently have the capacity to address. When fully 
implemented, Longa should allow FRI to design their broadcasts more intricately in line with the 
needs of farmers, and better deliver insights to those most in need, such as female and youth farm-
ers. Key results from the collaboration include a proof of concept for Longa, building on open -
source models and open access corpora, to be shared with the developer community upon comple-
tion of the final tool; a series of design principles iteratively and collaboratively developed to reflect 
the common values and goals of FRI and the CGIAR. These are being used to give shape to, and 
evaluate, the usability of Longa as development progresses; a 10% improvement upon the state -of-
the-art automatic speech recognition in Luganda -Radio-Speech performance and accuracy; some 
improvement of the performance with audio enhancement processes. Running on real world data, 
Luganda is a notoriously difficult language due to intonation and low training resources. This is 
further complicated by quality of phone call audio, and files were not recorded with speech recogni-
tion in mind. Presently only around 10% of the existing FRI data is of sufficient quality; and proof 
that fine-tuning is an effective approach to expanding Longa to new languages. By transferring 
knowledge of language, grammar, syntax and meaning from Swahili and Kinyarwanda to Luganda, 
we see great promise in moving forward with other Bantu languages and other challenging lan-
guages on the African continent. The next steps of the collaboration will focus on the analysis and 
interpretation of an aggregation of farmer phone calls, and integration with the existing FRI work-
flow and software. The CGIAR team will workshop a series of methods to investigate and action 
1. Problem Statement  
Farm Radio International (FRI) is an international non -profit 
which hosts agricultural talk -radio shows in 40 countries across 
sub-Saharan Africa, to make expert advice accessible to and 
comprehensible by small -scale farmers. They work on the prin-
ciple that 'Farmers have a lot to say', and 'as nations, organiza-
tions, and individuals, we all must commit to listening and tak-
ing action together … sharing knowledge and giving voice to 
farmers.’ As such, not only do they broadcast discussions be-
tween experts, tailored toward specific local problems, but they also receive and answer questions from farmers about their 
practices and demands. Unfortunately, a significant portion of 
these responses goes unanswered, as without the staff to manu-
ally translate each phone call, the information remains inacces-
sible. This presents a vast and rich dataset, speaking directly to 
the needs and desires of smallholders.  
In September of 2023, FRI launched their Nature Based Solu-
tions (NBS) project. This aims to initiate “actions to protect, 
sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosys-
tems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and 
adaptively, to provide both human well -being and biodiversity 
benefits,” according to the International Union for Conserva-

TECHNICAL REPORT  
2 CGIAR Research Initiative on Digital Innovation | on.cgiar.org/digital  tion of Nature (IUCN). In six countries (Burkina Faso, Côte 
d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Uganda and Zambia), “On Air Dia-
logues” with rural communities are being hosted by 20 radio 
stations to discover local priorities about, ideas for, and expe-
riences with, harnessing nature to adapt to a changing climate. 
Based on the results, more than 200 entertaining radio docu-
mentaries will be produced that showcase local solutions, and 
high-impact interactive radio programs will support rural Afri-
cans in bringing nature -based solutions to their communities. 
The best ideas that emerge from these programs will be spread 
Africa-wide through scripts and stories shared with a network 
of over 3,500 broadcasters in 38 countries.  
These radio programs aim to create an environment where 
women and youth have an increased role in contributing to 
conversations about the climate — and that decision and poli-
cy makers are paying attention to their voices.  
2. Proposal  
As outlined in Figure 1, it has been our intention to investigate 
the possibility of automating the process of transcribing, trans-
lating and analysing these data and to propose a tool —named 
LONGA (Swahili for ‘chat’ or ‘let’s talk’)—which might col-
lect rich information from a broad pool of farmers, leading to 
better-suited and longer -lasting interventions. Having com-
pleted a proof of concept in 2022, this report details a visit to 
the FRI offices in Uganda to better understand their challeng-
es, the progress of model development, and the intentions of 
the collaboration for the next year. Stages 5 to 8 of Figure 1 
will be the next focus of this work, devising the way in which 
data can be best interpreted, insight interfaced, and research 
findings established.  
3. Design Principles  
During our collaboration with FRI, the following design prin-
ciples have been synthesized to give shape to, and evaluate, 
Longa: 
1) Collaborative: the tool will be based on the needs, values 
and expertise of actors through the FRI value chain.  
2) User-centered: the tool will be capable of transcribing, 
translating, and delivering actionable insight.  
3) Longevity: the tool will eventually be handed off to FRI 
for independent use.  
4) Data driven: the tool will be sufficiently robust to be 
trained on real world data, to satisfy a real world use 
case 
5) Flexibility: the tool will be able to be expanded to in-clude new languages, without requiring significant input 
of the end user.  
6) Advance the field: the tool will utilize state -of-the-art 
technology, enhancing the FRI workflow whilst contrib-
uting to the broader AI community.  
7) Gender equality: the tool is intended to expand the num-
ber of female and youth farmers in voicing agricultural 
concerns.  
These principles were developed through iterative discussion 
and collaboration between CGIAR and FRI staff and give 
shape to our design pathway, as described below.  
4. Design Pathway  
Following a significant leap in artificial intelligence (AI) re-
search and development, the number of farmer that can be 
served by agricultural extension is increasing, as is the quality 
of advice and support by collecting data about their clients and 
providing site -specific, evidence based information. Natural 
language processing (NLP) tools, in particular, have enhanced 
remote-digital communication channels allowing for cross -
language interactions with little to no human intervention, 
overcoming barriers of illiteracy and geographic isolation.  
Two issues have, however, lessened the impact of AI and NLP 
in agricultural extension.  
The first of these is the continued lack of access to smart 
phones or other advanced information communication tech-
nologies by farmers. Smart phones are often looked upon with 
suspicion, as digital spaces may introduce new, unsafe spaces, 
thus commanding little trust within rural communities. FRI, 
on the other hand, through their decision to exploit the well -
established and highly trusted medium of radio across Africa, 
provide a lifeline to underserved farmers. FRI collaborate with 
locally operated radio stations, connecting the acquisition of 
information with the legitimacy of government and the draw 
of entertainment.  
The second issue is in relation to design. The advance of Afri-
can NLP has been severely limited due to the low digital pres-
ence of these languages, relative to more widely used western 
languages. Known as low -resource languages, it is difficult to 
attain sufficient training data from which to model and deliver 
the benefits of these tools to communities that are most in 
need. 
Recent efforts have attempted to increase the representation of 
low-resource languages for NLP through initiatives such as 
HuggingFace and Mozilla ’s Common Voice project. These

open-source networks of contributors have benefitted African 
languages not only with models, but user -contributed corpora 
that can be used to build more accurate and advanced tools.  
Other efforts have attempted to transfer learning from higher 
resource languages, utilizing their linguistic properties to re-
duce the necessary training data to achieve a successful out-
put. These are often difficult to implement in practice, howev-er, owing to the relatively complex and uninterpretable model 
designs required to achieve higher accuracies, as well as the 
fact that the datasets on which the models are trained are not 
representative of everyday interactions.  
This study is aimed at one aspect of NLP, adapting automatic 
speech recognition (ASR) technologies to low resource lan-
guages, with a focus on the Bantu group, building a tool that

4 CGIAR Research Initiative on Digital Innovation | on.cgiar.org/digital  can readily be integrated into workflows for real -world use. 
This project is therefore meeting a significant gap in the ad-
vancement of AI, bringing benefit to populations which would 
not otherwise have access due to low investment and skills in 
the private sector, localizing these tools and knowledge to 
support future development.  
4.1. Collaborate  
Year two began by developing a more robust, end -to-end ASR 
pipeline, trained and tested on open -source speech data. This 
was to be used in an in -person meeting with Farm Radio Inter-
national, scheduled for late June. Figure 2 shows the first au-
thor attending a meeting between FRI and one of their client 
radio stations.  
The visit was to serve two key objectives:  
· A chance for FRI and CGIAR staff to collaborate, discuss 
current progress as well as next steps and deployment options for the ASR model.  
· To attend  the launch of a new FRI initiative with radio 
stations in Uganda.  
The initiative launched by the Digital Innovation team in-
volved opening up Uliza Interactive —the software used by 
FRI to manage the radio show recordings —for public use, 
allowing radio stations to use the application for programs 
other than those related to FRI. The software was redesigned 
to allow for a more general -purpose and user -friendly inter-
face that would allow users to set up profiles (known as cam-
paigns) for different shows and manage each independently.  
Discussions around the ASR model involved introducing the 
Digital Innovation team to the concept underlying the model ’s 
design and demonstrating the model ’s capabilities. This was to 
help understand the motivation behind the current approach as 
well as to better align expectations for Longa ’s performance. 
The discussions also kickstarted conversations on how the

well as the necessary work needed to deploy the model into 
production.  
Table 1 is a summary of the activities along with the output 
that resulted from each as well as some notes on a few poten-
tially important observations.  
4.2. User-centered 
The current strategy utilized by FRI aims to inform farmers ’ 
decisions through radio. This makes radio stations the primary 
target of FRI interventions who then help to indirectly impact 
farming outcomes through the various programs. For this 
model to prove effective, FRI operates under the assumptions 
that: 
· Radio is the primary source of information within the 
community, commanding significant respect/trust among 
farmers. 
· Listeners are representative of the entire farmer popula-tion and therefore data collected during interviews repre-
sents shared views of the farming community. These are 
disaggregated to different catchment areas, however, with 
distinct communication and content according to local 
attributes.  
· Information shared through radio programs spreads from 
listeners to the community thus ultimately impacting the 
larger population. This is often restricted by social fac-
tors, for example, in male headed households, women are 
not allowed to participate.  
To ensure effectiveness of the intervention, FRI oversees the 
design of each radio program, incorporating research tech-
niques. This allows the Monitoring, Evaluation, Research, and 
Learning (MERL) team to assess each project ’s impact and in 
turn inform policy. Moreover, to ensure effective targeting, 
the radio shows are aired to the public but only in a language 
predominant in a specific community. This is done to encour-
age participation from local communities so as to collect data 
from within the desired population.

TECHNICAL REPORT  
6 CGIAR Research Initiative on Digital Innovation | on.cgiar.org/digital  Uliza Application  
Uliza is the software that FRI uses to manage the various pro-
jects running with radio stations. The software comprises Uli-
za Interactive —the user interface through which the radio 
programs and interview responses/recordings are managed —
as well as Uliza Log which comprises the database and is used 
to store and manage data related to the various radio pro-
grams. 
The design of the software would allow for easy integration of 
the model into FRI ’s current workflow. Since Uliza interactive 
already supports manual transcription of recordings, incorpo-
rating the model would only require the software to call the 
model, run inference on the speech data collected and output 
the transcriptions for the user.  
Uliza Interactive for General Use  
Other than radio programs directed at farmers, FRI has opened 
Uliza Interactive to partner radio stations allowing them to 
make full use of the platform for their own personal needs. 
This involves a change in the UI with more management op-
tions, such as adding users and assigning roles, creating cus-
tomizable campaigns for different shows. This initiative came 
as a result of previous requests by radio stations to have a 
more general -purpose platform that would better integrate 
with their workflow.  
The launch of the initiative was included as one of the objec-
tives of the visit where the FRI team pitched the technology to 
Radio Simba who appeared keen to implement it. Along with 
the improved interface, radio stations would receive up to 
$2,000 worth of airtime to help cover the costs of calling back 
listeners while carrying out radio interviews.  
ASR Model  
During the visit, the concepts underlying the model ’s func-
tioning were discussed. This was a chance to gage the trans-
ferability of the tool, as well as expanding on some of the 
choices made in the design, giving and receiving feedback as 
to the utility of the output.  
It was revealed that it would be most useful to have Longa 
integrated within the NBS program where it would allow for 
field-testing and evaluation. The program is currently ongoing 
in Uganda with a focus on shows presented in Luganda. This 
demanded a change in strategy and focus of model develop-
ment.  
Luganda ASR  
Once Luganda was decided on as the language of focus, the model was finetuned to open -source Mozilla data. This includ-
ed around 100 hours of annotated speech data with about 50 
hours of it used to train the model and the remaining used to 
evaluate performance on unseen data. The model was trained 
for 28 epochs achieving a validation (unseen data) WER of 
around 34%.  
Following evaluation with a portion of the open -source data, 
the model was used to transcribe sample data collected by the 
FRI team which included around 97 audio recordings. Having 
not been manually transcribed, the model ’s performance on 
the recordings was evaluated with help from some of the 
Uganda FRI staff. This not only gave insight to the model, but 
also the complexity of the language itself.  
Luganda Linguistics  
Once the model was run on the recordings, native Luganda 
speakers aided in evaluating the performance by listening to 
recordings and comparing the transcribed text with the utter-
ances in the audio files.  
The exercise revealed that the model managed to accurately 
identify the acoustic patterns in the audio but failed to incor-
porate the grammatical rules of the language. This was most 
evident in recordings with muffled speech where the model 
would output tokens that sounded most similar but were gram-
matically incorrect as pointed out by native speakers.  
Apart from technical difficulties, however, having native 
speakers help interpret the results revealed that Luganda is 
governed by relatively complex rules that are even more com-
plicated for the written language. Moreover, it appears the 
language is predominantly spoken with many not being able to 
write it. This indicates that some aspects of the spoken lan-
guage may not have necessarily developed in written form, 
especially in digital media.  
Along with the complex structure of Luganda, the language is 
often used interchangeably with Lusoga, another language 
most spoken by natives. Mixing the two languages is such 
common practice that natives would not identify the switch 
unless explicitly instructed to. This is the case with the FRI 
data collected where some interviews were carried out in 
Lusoga and it was only through interpreting the model results 
that this was pointed out.  
4.3. Longevity  
To approach the morphological complexity Luganda demand-
ed a review of the model pipeline. While uneven, this space of 
AI is advancing at a fast pace, in well -documented, open -
source spaces – and we were able to draw on state -of-the art 
Page 7:
TECHNICAL REPORT  
7 CGIAR Research Initiative on Digital Innovation | on.cgiar.org/digital  models to inform our work.  
Chanie et al. (2023) developed a multilingual ASR model for 
Kinyarwanda, Swahili, and Luganda. The study made use of 
Mozilla’s Common Voice initiative to access transcribed au-
dio data for each language, combining the datasets and jointly 
training the model to better capture the patterns within the 
languages and achieve a multilingual speech recognition mod-
el that performs well across the languages.  
Mukiibi et al. (2022) built an end -to-end speech recognition 
system used to monitor radio conversations for keywords that 
can later be utilized to carry out further analysis. The research-
ers also collected over 150 hours of radio speech data that was 
used extensively in this study to evaluate model performance.  
Recordings from Mozilla's Common Voice initiative proved to 
be less representative of radio/phone conversations owing to 
relatively more background noise and, in many cases, having 
less clearer utterances which significantly impacted model 
performance.  
Longa was then finetuned and evaluated on two open -source 
datasets that include a Luganda radio speech corpus collated 
by Mukiibi et al. (2022) as well as a Swahili broadcast news 
corpus from Gauthier et al. (2016). The Luganda radio speech 
corpus comprised around 155 hours of speech data, only 20 of 
which was transcribed and ultimately used to finetune and test 
the models, while the Swahili dataset comprised 10 hours of 
transcribed speech data. Each dataset was partitioned into a 
train, validation, and test set which were used to finetune and 
evaluate model performance.  
This approach has allowed us to satisfy a series of concerns 
raised by FRI that:  · Longa would at some point become unavailable, whether 
removed from the internet or protected by a paywall.  
· FRI would not be able to build and improve upon Longa 
over time  
· FRI would be dependent on CGIAR for maintenance and 
hosting.  
Utilizing open -source software and corpora ensures that the 
input data and models will not disappear, rather they will grow 
and become more reliable through the support of user commu-
nities and, being well documented, FRI engineers may adapt 
and build on the model as and when necessary.  
That said, having manual transcriptions of the remaining data 
will allow for training on a much larger dataset and potentially 
have a significant impact on model performance.  
This includes the ability to deal with code switching as well as 
to better capture the natural language. Moreover, the radio 
recordings allow for the model to pick up on issues such as 
varied sound quality and intonations that are less represented 
in data that is sourced in a manner as done by the Common 
Voice project but are more prevalent in phone conversations 
carried out on air.  
4.4. Data-driven 
Data Preprocessing  
To prepare for real -world data, the model had to be first 
trained the open -source corpora.  
Files containing the location, duration, and transcript for each 
of the audio files were prepared from the tsv data frame of 
each dataset. The model then used these to locate the audio 
Figure 3. Outlier samples (left) discarded to have more uniform sequence lengths (right) (Source: Authors)  
Page 8:
TECHNICAL REPORT  
8 CGIAR Research Initiative on Digital Innovation | on.cgiar.org/digital  files which would be read and passed into the model during the 
training and validation process.  
Owing to the operation of the model, longer sequences require 
larger resources such as GPU, and as such, samples containing 
more than 20 words in the transcript were discarded from the 
train set (Figure 3). This was to ensure the model trained with-
out running into out of memory (OOM) errors when met with 
long text sequences. Following the cleaning, each dataset com-
prised audio files roughly 20s long with no more than 20 words 
in each. 
Model Architecture  
Wang et al. (2019) and Prabhavalkar et al. (2023) review vari-
ous ASR architectures, outlining the pros and cons from the 
more traditional hidden Markov models to more recent devel-
opments in end -to-end models. The articles investigate the vari-
ous architecture designs and identify the end -to-end model as 
being more advantageous compared to the traditional architec-
ture. The articles do further comparisons on the performance of 
three end-to-end mechanisms (CTC, Attention, RNN -
Transducer) and identifies RNN -Transducer and attention -
based models as having higher performance compared to CTC 
models, albeit at the cost of model complexity.  
KoSpeech —an open-source toolkit for end -to-end Korean 
speech recognition —was initially used to study the various 
morpheme -based model architectures. Their approach imple-
ments several designs including attention -based models as well 
as models based on the CTC loss (kospeech, n.d.)  
RNN-T Model 
The RNN -Transducer (Figure 4) is an advancement on the 
CTC overcoming its two main limitations where a CTC archi-
tecture assumes independence of elements (words, characters, 
etc) in the output sequence and can only map an input sequence 
to output sequences shorter than itself.  
Moreover, the RNN -T model has language modelling capabili-
ties, owing to its joint network, and supports streaming speech 
recognition, a feature not supported by attention -based models. 
The morpheme -based model is thus based on the RNN -T mod-
el trained using the RNN -T loss. 
The model is composed of 3 components/subnetworks:  
· Transcription Network (acoustic encoder/model) which 
receives the acoustic input sequence and maps it to a fea-
ture sequence, mapping onto a high -level representation.  
· Prediction Network (language model) which is an RNN 
network that models the interdependencies within the out-

viously emitted symbols into the model.  
· Joint Network that aligns the input and output sequences 
mixing both acoustic and language model outputs via a 
monotonic alignment process (Albesano, 2022).  
Initial designs of the model utilized the LSTM unit as the en-
coder, however, since RNNs are only effective at capturing 
short-term dependencies, the use of transformers for encoders 
is preferred since it captures global context, allowing for im-
proved performance over RNN models.  
Conformer Model  
Combining a convolutional neural network (CNN), effective 
at capturing local context, with a transformer network to re-
place the RNN encoder improves modelling capabilities and 
hence performance (Gulati, et al., 2020). Moreover, owing to 
how the model effectively captures both local and global con-
texts, a relatively simpler conformer architecture can be im-
plemented to achieve results that are comparable to, or poten-
tially better than, a transformer model.  
For example, (Koo, 2021) designed a conformer -based Korean 
speech recognition system (Figure 5) and compared its perfor-
mance to a transformer variant observing improved perfor-
mance with the conformer model. The model utilized in this 
project will therefore be based on a conformer architecture 
similar to the one implemented in this study including the pa-
rameter selection employed in the model design.  
4.5. Flexibility  
The experiments conducted in this study entailed making use 
of openly available pretrained models from Nvidia ’s GPU 
Cloud, specifically the Kinyarwanda pretrained model , as 
well as the multilingual model from Chanie et al. (2023). This 
was done to not only cut down on the training time but to also 
highlight the ease with which it is to incorporate new lan-
guages with LONGA as well as to establish a reference point 
to evaluate the tool ’s performance, accuracy and efficiency.  
· Nvidia NeMo: A conversational AI toolkit built to help 
researchers from industry and academia to reuse prior 
work (code and pretrained models) —was used to build, 
experiment, as well as finetune the ASR models. The 
toolkit comes equipped with a variety of pretrained mod-
els and is built on top of pytorch and pytorch lightning, 
making it relatively easier to experiment and keep record 
of the results.  
· Google Colab: The experiments were carried out through Google Colaboratory, making use of the pro+ version 
which gives access to up to 40GB of GPU memory and 
80GB of RAM on the A100 Nvidia GPU runtime. Owing 
to the data size and model configurations, the experiments 
took only around 25GB of VRAM and about 16GB of 
RAM to run. However, this was at the trade -off of run-
ning for longer periods of up to 8 hours for each experi-
ment.  
· Nvidia Riva: A GPU -accelerated software development 
kit(SDK) for building Speech AI applications —will be 
used to integrate the ASR model(s) with FRI ’s current 
workflow. This includes designing a workflow that inte-
grates NeMo as well as Uliza to allow for users to more 
seamlessly train, finetune, and deploy models of different 
languages of interest. The latest Riva toolkit is free and 
open to researchers allowing processing of up to 1,000 
hours of audio per day for ASR projects.  
By incorporating these back end tools, it is hoped that Longa 
should be accessible to users beyond the AI community, al-
lowing for use without requiring advanced AI or programming 
expertise.  
4.6. Advance the field  
Using Nvidia ’s NeMo toolkit, the model parameters, such the 
number of layers in each network as well as the number of 
epochs to train the model, are specified using config(.yaml) 
files which can easily be set using readymade scripts from the 
toolkit’s repository. Moreover, for many the ASR models, and 
especially the Conformer models, there are predefined config-
urations along with their requirements and use cases in the 
repo that can be downloaded and modified accordingly to suit 
experiment needs. Each of the pretrained models used in our 
experiments was based on the Large Conformer -Transducer

ing (BPE) tokenizer from HuggingFace (Table 2).  
Model Training and Evaluation  
Each of the models were finetuned on both the Luganda and 
Swahili datasets for a total of 100 epochs. The experiments 
were first conducted without altering the model ’s configura-
tions and thereafter the models ’ encoder layers were frozen for 
the first 50 epochs. This was done to allow the decoder to first 
pick up on patterns previously learned by the models when 
first trained prior to our experiments and after have the encod-
er and decoder train simultaneously for the remainder of the 
experiments.  The experiments made use of two pretrained conformer mod-
els, i.e. a Kinyarwanda mode(rw) from Nvidia and a multilin-
gual Kinyarwanda, Swahili, and Luganda model(rw -sw-lu) 
from the Makerere study on radio speech. With each model 
finetuned both with and without freezing the encoder layer, 
there were a total of 8 experiments with 8 corresponding mod-
el checkpoints. The models ’ performance was evaluated ba","8284"

El estudio, realizado mediante la identificación de actores, la recolección de alcances y la realización de grupos focales en el campo, incluyó entrevistas a profundidad con un total de 35 actores que participan activamente en las MTAs con un rol definido. Además, se contó con la participación de 21 agricultores en grupos focales distribuidos en tres estados: Estado de México, Chiapas, así como en el Estado de Morelos. Este enfoque integral tuvo como objetivo recopilar percepciones y perspectivas de actores clave involucrados en el marco de los MTAs, fomentando una mejor comprensión de su alcance, escalamiento y efectos en las prácticas agrícolas y las colaboraciones en las regiones especificadas. La colaboración entre CIMMYT, SADER, gobiernos estatales y diversas instituciones destaca la naturaleza multifacética de la implementación de MTAs en México. La MTA de Chiapas, ha sido pionera en la implementación y escalamiento de las MTA en México, alrededor de 5 años de experiencia y consolidándose como la MTA más establecida del país, con un sólido enlace con el Hub que facilita la llegada efectiva a los agricultores. La MTA del Estado de México, establecida en 2021, ha sido clave en difundir información agroclimática y transformar institucionalmente la región. Aunque se centra más en proveer información que en espacios de participación y discusión. La MTA de Morelos, establecida en 2023 y analizada en este informe a pesar de su breve existencia, demuestra su relevancia en el panorama agroclimático de la región con iniciativas previas relacionadas con la producción y difusión de información agroclimática, su impacto se ha visto potenciado por estas iniciativas preexistentes.  Se mencionaron retos significativos y oportunidades clave en el ámbito de la traducción y difusión de información para personas con limitada alfabetización, que requieren una simplificación de la información. Las oportunidades se centran en la zonificación de pronósticos, la expansión de medios de difusión, el compromiso de los productores y la formulación de políticas sostenibles. Además, se destaca la necesidad de generar cambios en las prácticas agrícolas, aunque la confianza en los pronósticos agroclimáticos ha crecido, la implementación de cambios es un proceso gradual limitado a las condiciones del mercado.

December 23 | HISTORIA Y ESCALAMIENTO DE LAS MESAS TÉCNICAS AGROCLIMÁTICAS EN MÉXICO 3  INTRODUCCIÓN Las herramientas de información climática más recientes, que abarcan análisis históricos, sistemas de monitoreo y predicciones climáticas, tienen el potencial de asistir a los agricultores en la adaptación a los efectos de la variabilidad y cambio climático. Al suministrar datos climáticos locales de manera comprensible, junto con servicios de extensión, los agricultores se encuentran mejor equipados para enfrentar eventos climáticos extremos y aprovechar condiciones climáticas favorables. Esto contribuye a cerrar la brecha entre la generación de información agroclimática y su aplicación práctica por parte de los agricultores (Giraldo-Mendez, D. et al, 2018). Para lograr cerrar la brecha entre la generación de información agroclimática y su aplicación, nace el enfoque de Mesas Técnicas Agroclimáticas (MTAs), las cuales representan una iniciativa innovadora cuyo propósito es reunir a diversos actores del sector agropecuario a nivel local, con el objetivo de proporcionar información a los pequeños productores sobre los cambios climáticos previstos en su región. Las MTA buscan informar acerca de cómo estos cambios pueden afectar sus cultivos y ofrecen orientación sobre acciones para mitigar los impactos negativos. Facilitan la creación de espacios de diálogo entre los participantes para la gestión de información agroclimática local, con la finalidad de identificar las mejores prácticas de adaptación a fenómenos climáticos. Posteriormente, esta información se transfiere a técnicos y productores locales mediante el Boletín Agroclimático Local, que resume las predicciones estacionales y los pronósticos climáticos discutidos en la mesa, junto con recomendaciones y medidas adaptativas específicas para cada tipo de cultivo. De esta manera, las MTAs han sido implementadas en 11 países—Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Chile, Panamá, El Salvador, Perú, Paraguay y México—sumando una red de más de 70 MTAs en América Latina (Figura 1). Las MTAs involucran a más de 462 instituciones y han tenido un impacto positivo en la vida de más de 500 mil agricultores, proporcionándoles información agroclimática a nivel local para mejorar la toma de decisiones en sus sistemas productivos. Para México específicamente, se han establecido MTAs en 12 estados, incluidos Chiapas, Oaxaca, Estado de México, Yucatán, Campeche, Puebla, Veracruz, Michoacán, Morelos, San Luis Potosí y Baja California. Allí, el proceso de establecimiento de las MTA inicio con el soporte de Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo (CIMMYT)  a través de los Hubs de innovación del programa MasAgro y la Secretaría de Agricultura (SADER), con el respaldo de los gobiernos estatales y la contribución de instituciones como el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (CONAGUA), INIFAP, entre otras. El programa MasAgro en México, tiene como objetivo aumentar la productividad, rentabilidad y sostenibilidad del maíz y trigo, para comprender cómo ocurren los procesos de innovación en contextos heterogéneos y cambiantes. MasAgro comenzó en 2010 como un esfuerzo conjunto entre y la Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganadería, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentación (SAGARPA) del Gobierno Mexicano. MasAgro se implementa a través de una red de 'Hubs = centros' que abarcan gran parte de México. En MasAgro, un Hub se considera una red de actores de la cadena de valor de una región agroecológica específica que trabajan juntos en soluciones sostenibles en sistemas agrícolas basados en maíz y trigo. El Hub tiene como objetivo fomentar procesos de innovación a nivel regional, teniendo en cuenta los diferentes contextos (Hellin et al., 2014). La iniciativa de investigación AgriLAC Resiliente—Sistemas Resilientes de Innovación Agro-Alimentaria guiando la Seguridad Alimentaria, Crecimiento Inclusivo y Reducción de la Emigración en América Latina y el Caribe—tiene como objetivo, aumentar la resiliencia, sostenibilidad y competitividad de los sistemas y actores agroalimentarios en América Latina y el Caribe al aumentar su capacidad de respuesta a necesidades urgentes en materia de seguridad alimentaria, reducir los riesgos climáticos, estabilizar las comunidades vulnerables al conflicto y reducir la emigración. En el marco de la iniciativa AgriLAC, se ha realizado este estudio en México en cuatro MTAs— Chiapas, Estado de México, Yucatán y Morelos. El estudio apunta a entender la historia del establecimiento de las MTA, su escalamiento, particularidades en cada estado, ingredientes de éxito y lecciones aprendidas. Esto permitirá, en primer lugar, realizar una caracterización de las MTA y entender las historias de éxito. En un mediano plazo, permitirá entender cuáles son las instituciones clave, acciones y metodologías efectivas y necesidades específicas de los agricultores, para realizar recomendaciones que permitan a las MTA generar herramientas para aumentar la resiliencia, sostenibilidad y competitividad. Este documento presenta resultados preliminares de la primera fase 2023.

Figura 1. Países en donde se han contextualizado y escalado las MTAs METODOLOGÍA Esta sección presenta la metodología utilizada para caracterizar y comprender la historia y el proceso de escalamiento de las Mesas Técnicas Agroclimáticas (MTA) en México. La Figura 2 presenta el proceso metodológico para entender la historia y los alcances de las MTA en México. En primer lugar, se realizó la identificación de actores e instituciones clave y participantes en las MTA. En segundo lugar, se realizaron entrevistas a profundidad para una cosecha de alcances. Finalmente, se realizó trabajo de campo en el que se efectuaron grupos focales con representantes de instituciones, técnicos y agricultores.

December 23 | HISTORIA Y ESCALAMIENTO DE LAS MESAS TÉCNICAS AGROCLIMÁTICAS EN MÉXICO 5  Figura 2. Proceso metodológico       PASO 1: Identificación de actores El primer paso del proceso metodológico para la reconstrucción de la historia y escalamiento de las MTA en México, así como el análisis de los alcances y transformaciones en territorio, es la identificación de los actores clave que asisten a las MTAs. Cabe resaltar que si bien las MTAs a la fecha han estado impulsada y apoyada por la Secretaría de Agricultura (SADER) y los gobiernos estatales, la metodología y establecimiento de la primera MTA fue llevada al país en primera instancia por el Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo (CIMMYT), a través de sus Hub o centros de Innovación y el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT). A través de los Hub o nodos de innovación, el CIMMYT (mediante su oficina central y sus oficinas regionales) de la mano de la SADER y gobiernos estatales, han llevado el enfoque de las MTA a los territorios. Que incluye, la convocatoria de actores clave del territorio, facilitar la MTA, implementando la metodología, la creación y publicación del boletín agroclimático y llevando la información a los agricultores. Por esta razón, el primer punto de contacto fueron los gerentes regionales de cada Hub:   o Hub de Estado México (maneja operaciones de los estados de México, Puebla, Hidalgo y Ciudad de México) o Hub de Estado Chiapas o Hub de Yucatán (maneja operaciones de los estados de Yucatán, Quintana Roo y Campeche) o Hub de Oaxaca  Cada uno de los gerentes de Hub fue entrevistado, en el que se solicitó narrar el proceso de implementación y escalamiento de cada una de las MTA. Adicionalmente, los gerentes respondieron una encuesta estructurada en la que se buscó caracterizar la participación de las instituciones en la MTA con una matriz de identificación de actores. Los módulos, cantidad de preguntas y objetivo son presentados en la Tabla 1.   Tabla 1. Encuesta identificación de actores de MTA. Módulo Preguntas Objetivo A. Identificación del respondiente 4 preguntas Identificación del entrevistado, institución, cargo y rol en la MTA B. MTA historia 5 preguntas Narrar el proceso de implementación, retos y oportunidades de la MTA C. Identificación de actores 7 preguntas Identificación de todos los actores que participan en la MTA, nivel de acción, tipo de institución, rol y datos del punto focal  La matriz de identificación de actores fue llenada por cada uno de los entrevistados, con la información de todas las instituciones participantes en la MTA de su territorio, caracterizando el tipo, nivel de acción, el rol dentro de la MTA y los datos de contacto del punto focal. Con esta matriz de actores se construyó la base de datos para la cosecha de alcances.  
Page 7:
December 23 | HISTORIA Y ESCALAMIENTO DE LAS MESAS TÉCNICAS AGROCLIMÁTICAS EN MÉXICO 6  PASO 2: Cosecha de alcances El enfoque de cosecha de alcances permite, mediante la revisión de material secundario y entrevistas con actores involucrados en la implementación de acciones y espacios como la MTA, la identificación de alcances y transformaciones en un territorio determinado. Los componentes de la cosecha de alcances se definen así: i. Agente de cambio: Mesas Técnicas Agroclimáticas (MTA) ii. Actores sociales: instituciones y comunidad participantes.  iii. Cosechador: el entrevistador externo.   Para triangular las fuentes de información relacionadas con los alcances se utilizó información secundaria, principalmente los boletines de las MTA. Sin embargo, la mayoría de la información proviene de las entrevistas semiestructuradas realizadas a los actores identificados en el punto previo.  El proceso que se sigue en una cosecha de alcances es el siguiente: 1. Identificar la pregunta que guíe la cosecha de alcances, que cubra los posibles alcances derivados de la implementación de las MTA 2. Revisión de la base de datos generada en la identificación de actores. Cada punto focal fue contactado, mediante una invitación por correo electrónico. Adicionalmente, se realizó trabajo de campo en los estados priorizados, con entrevistas presenciales.  3. El Cosechador obtiene información de los participantes de las MTA a través de entrevistas semiestructuradas (cara a cara) para identificar cambios reales en percepciones o comportamientos de los Actores Sociales y cómo la MTA ha tenido influencia.  4. El análisis de la información obtenida mediante la revisión de documentación y las entrevistas se realiza compilando la información para responder las preguntas ¿Quién cambió qué? ¿Cuándo se cambió? ¿Cómo la MTA ha contribuido a estos cambios? 5. Los alcances potenciales son revisados y, aquellos que deban ser verificados son seleccionados para incrementar la precisión. Estos alcances luego son verificados y triangulados; esto significa que las afirmaciones identificadas deben estar confirmadas de diferentes maneras y por diferentes actores.  6. Finalmente, se identifican las grandes áreas de transformación que emergen, agrupando los alcances por grandes áreas de transformación.  La Tabla 2 presenta la estructura de la entrevista semiestructurada realizada a los puntos focales, representantes de instituciones y actores presentes en la MTA de cada territorio. Luego de la identificación del respondiente y la caracterización de la institución, se realizó una serie de 17 de preguntas, la mayoría abiertas, para identificar los cambios y transformaciones que se han percibido luego de la implementación de la MTA en el territorio.   Tabla 2. Entrevista de cosecha de alcances. Módulo Preguntas Objetivo A. Identificación del respondiente 8 preguntas Identificación del entrevistado, datos de contacto, institución y cargo  B.

Fuente: elaboración propia La Tabla 3 presenta la cantidad de entrevistados por cada uno de los estados. Se realizaron entrevistas a profundidad a un total 35 actores involucrados transversalmente a las MTA o participantes de una MTA específica. De acuerdo con la cantidad de actores entrevistados, se realizó una posterior priorización para el trabajo de campo y grupos focales.

Para este ejercicio, se realizó una priorización inicial de 3 estados para 2023 y un estado (Yucatán) para 2024 o Estado de México o Estado de Chiapas o Estado de Yucatán o Estado de Morelos  Esta priorización se realizó con base en la información obtenida en la identificación de actores y en la cosecha de alcances, determinando los estados en que la implementación de la MTA ha tenido el suficiente rango temporal para vincular actores relevantes, realizar sesiones periódicas, generar al menos un boletín agroclimático e implementar una estrategia de difusión de la información. El grupo focal es un método de encuesta cualitativa que puede utilizarse para evaluar un programa con el fin de conocer las perspectivas de los participantes sobre el tema de la intervención (Patton, 2015). En este caso, el objetivo es evaluar los efectos de la disponibilidad y el uso de los servicios de información climática por parte de los agricultores. Cada grupo focal con los agricultores tuvo una duración aproximada de 2 horas, en las que el facilitador realizó 3 actividades participativas diferentes. Las actividades se realizaron de manera grupal, de manera que todos los productores pudieran entregar sus opiniones y percepciones.    
 
Figura 3. Grupo focal Estado Morelos.

December 23 | HISTORIA Y ESCALAMIENTO DE LAS MESAS TÉCNICAS AGROCLIMÁTICAS EN MÉXICO 8  En total en los grupos focales participaron 21 agricultores, Chiapas (11); Estado de México (6) y Morelos (4).  La Tabla 4 presenta los 3 diferentes módulos abordados dentro de cada grupo focal. En primer lugar, se realizó una caracterización del clima histórico en la región, identificando mes a mes cuáles son las condiciones climáticas predominantes y las actividades agrícolas relacionadas con los cultivos principales. En segundo lugar, se realiza una identificación de eventos climáticos extremos sufridos en los últimos años, así como las afectaciones sufridas y las alertas e información previa sobre el evento. Finalmente, se efectuó una discusión sobre la información agroclimática recibida y utilizada por los agricultores; esta discusión permite comprender si reciben información de la MTA o de otra fuente, su uso y las necesidades de información.

Aunque hay 12 MTAs implementadas en México (ver figura 4), de acuerdo con la información recopilada mediante el proceso de identificación de actores y la recolección de alcances, se han priorizado cuatro MTAs: i) Estado de México, ii) Chiapas, iii) Yucatán y iv) Morelos. Estas MTAs fueron priorizadas debido al estado de implementación de cada una, al contexto específico, al alcance y al involucramiento de los actores en el espacio. En el centro del país se encuentran las MTAs de Morelos y Estado de México; en el sur, Chiapas. Según los resultados obtenidos, cada una de las MTAs priorizadas se encuentra en estados diferentes de implementación, contando con contextos específicos particulares y áreas de transformación diferentes.

December 23 | HISTORIA Y ESCALAMIENTO DE LAS MESAS TÉCNICAS AGROCLIMÁTICAS EN MÉXICO 9  La MTA de Chiapas fue la primera en ser implementada en México, en el año 2019; ha estado en funcionamiento durante aproximadamente 5 años y se considera la MTA más consolidada del país. En 2021 se estableció la MTA del Estado de México, sesionando dos veces al año y con un destacado componente institucional y técnico, como se detalla más adelante. Finalmente, la MTA de Morelos se estableció en 2023 y ha celebrado sesiones solo una vez; a pesar de su corta existencia, el espacio no parte desde cero, por lo que se analiza en este informe. A continuación (Tabla 5), se presentan los resultados para cada una de las MTA. En primer lugar, se describe brevemente la historia y el escalonamiento de las MTA. Luego, se presenta la identificación de actores. En tercer lugar, se detallan las áreas de transformación identificadas, que han sido divididas en dos tipos.  Tabla 5.

Figura 5. Historia del Hub de innovación de Chiapas (Fuente: FUTOP, 2017) 1.1 Historia y escalamiento Chiapas fue el estado pionero en las MTA de México, con la implementación del primer espacio de este tipo en el año 2019. Antes de la instalación de la primera MTA en el estado, el INIFAP (Instituto Nacional de Investigación Forestal, Agrícola y Pecuaria de México) en el Hub de Chiapas (Figura 5), había realizado un trabajo previo durante aproximadamente tres años, enfocado en la promoción de los pronósticos agroclimáticos con un alcance limitado a ciertos grupos de agricultores en el Hub. En este sentido, el INIFAP se encargaba de generar pronósticos para el estado, realizaba y compartía la información. Sin embargo, según lo manifestado por los actores clave en la zona, existía variabilidad en la precisión y confiabilidad de los pronósticos generados; algunas zonas del estado contaban con alta precisión y otros con pronósticos poco confiables, debido a la falta de estaciones meteorológicas y al inadecuado mantenimiento de estas. Las recomendaciones estaban sujetas a la información de cada estación. Únicamente se presentaba el pronóstico y se entregaban algunas recomendaciones, las cuales eran complementadas con información técnica de expertos en agronomía, sin la generación de boletines o procesos participativos de discusión. 
Page 11:
December 23 | HISTORIA Y ESCALAMIENTO DE LAS MESAS TÉCNICAS AGROCLIMÁTICAS EN MÉXICO 10  En 2020, el CIAT y el CIMMYT, a través del Hub regional de Chiapas, iniciaron oficialmente la implementación de la primera MTA. Se convocó a otros colaboradores, incluyendo instituciones, socios y consultores, quienes comenzaron a trabajar de manera colaborativa para generar recomendaciones más localizadas, difundir información e incluso realizar un seguimiento a las actividades de los productores en diferentes regiones. Así, se pasó de proporcionar información agroclimática para dos grandes regiones del estado a generar pronósticos y recomendaciones para las 15 regiones que dividen Chiapas. La integración de la SADER (Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural), el Servicio Meteorológico de CONAGUA, INIFAP y CIMMYT permitió unir esfuerzos técnicos para fortalecer los pronósticos climáticos y la generación de recomendaciones localizadas. Asimismo, el CIMMYT incorporó el enfoque de las MTA y recomendaciones basadas en pronósticos climáticos en sus proyectos de extensión e implementación de prácticas para el aumento de productividad y sostenibilidad. Para lograrlo, aseguró que tanto los profesionales del Centro como los consultores y socios locales que conformaban nodos de productores en las diferentes regiones recibieran capacitaciones en información agroclimática y transmitieran las recomendaciones.  En la actualidad, además del espacio de la MTA que se lleva a cabo de manera presencial y al cual se conectan algunos nodos de productores de manera remota, existen otros canales de difusión. En concreto, hay tres grupos de WhatsApp —uno para participantes de la MTA, otro para técnicos de todo el estado y un tercero para agricultores— donde se comparte información de pronósticos y recomendaciones de manera frecuente. También se cuenta con un grupo de Facebook con más de 2 mil seguidores, se ha invitado a medios de comunicación de radio local y los participantes disponen de listas de difusión para enviar el boletín. La Figura 6 presenta algunas estadísticas relacionadas con la MTA y el boletín. Hasta la fecha actual, se han emitido un total de 7 boletines, los cuales han contado con la participación de entre 10 y 13 instituciones en su producción y edición. En cuanto a las descargas del boletín, el número máximo alcanzó las 350 descargas, oscilando en un promedio de entre 100 y 200 descargas para el resto de los boletines. Sin embargo, es importante destacar que la mayoría de los productores reciben las recomendaciones agroclimáticas a través de los grupos de WhatsApp, listas de difusión, Facebook y de manera presencial en escuelas de campo y actividades de extensión de INIFAP, CIMMYT y otros participantes de la MTA, como la Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro (UAAAN), la cual difunde el boletín entre sus estudiantes y más de 5,000 seguidores en redes sociales.

La mayoría de actores (Figura 7) son del gobierno, con 4 de nivel nacional: Secretaría de Agricultura de Chiapas, Secretaría de Medio Ambiente de Chiapas, Secretaría General del Gobierno de Chiapas y SADER seccional Chiapas. Los otros 3 actores de gobierno son del orden nacional: SADER, FIRA (Fideicomisos Instituidos en Relación con la Agricultura) y FND (Financiera Nacional de Desarrollo Agropecuario). Le siguen 3 actores de educación de nivel local y 2 nacionales, entre las que se destacan: Universidad Autónoma de Chiapas (UNACH), Universidad Antonio Narro (UAAAN) y la Universidad de Ciencias y Artes de Chiapas (UNICACH)-. Asimismo, la MTA cuenta con la importante participación del Consejo Consultivo de Cambio Climático de Chiapas y otros participantes de la sociedad civil, del sector privado y organizaciones de productores que permiten la amplia difusión que tiene el boletín. Finalmente, el brazo técnico de la MTA está soportado por INIFAP y CIMMYT.

December 23 | HISTORIA Y ESCALAMIENTO DE LAS MESAS TÉCNICAS AGROCLIMÁTICAS EN MÉXICO 12  Transformaciones institucionales • Generación o fortalecimiento de programas institucionales La primera área de transformación identificada, que abarca alcances y efectos derivados de la implementación de la MTA en el estado de Chiapas, es la generación y fortalecimiento de programas institucionales relacionados con la variabilidad, cambio climático y uso de información agroclimática para la mitigación del riesgo. Como se mencionó en la sección de historia y escalamiento, el INIFAP había llevado a cabo un esfuerzo significativo y valioso previamente para generar información agroclimática y difundir recomendaciones. No obstante, dicho esfuerzo se ejecutaba de manera individual, sin el respaldo o colaboración de otras instituciones federales o estatales y sin la participación de otros actores de la sociedad. La implementación de la MTA, con la participación activa del CIMMYT a través del Hub de Chiapas y el posterior compromiso de la SADER, ha llevado a la creación de un espacio oficial, interinstitucional y normativo en el estado donde se genera y discute información agroclimática localizada. Además, la MTA ha logrado el compromiso del gobierno estatal, con la vinculación de tres de sus secretarías: gobierno, agricultura y medio ambiente. El éxito de la MTA de Chiapas en la implementación de esfuerzos interinstitucionales de las áreas de gobierno, academia, investigación y sociedad civil impulsó el escalamiento de las MTA a nivel federal por parte de la SADER. Tomando como ejemplo la experiencia de la MTA de Chiapas. • Personal técnico apoyando en territorio La segunda área de transformación, que engloba los logros de la MTA a nivel institucional, es el aumento de personal técnico dedicado a capacitar y difundir información agroclimática en el territorio. Es importante recordar el esfuerzo previo realizado por el INIFAP antes de la implementación de la MTA para generar información y llevarla al territorio. Con la introducción de la MTA en Chiapas, estos esfuerzos se multiplicaron. La gerencia del Hub regional de Chiapas del CIMMYT integró la capacitación y difusión de información agroclimática en todos los programas de investigación, extensión y fortalecimiento que se llevaron a cabo en la zona.  En este sentido, los profesionales del CIMMYT, consultores y técnicos pertenecientes a los socios y aliados locales recibieron instrucciones para realizar varias acciones. En primer lugar, se les encomendó capacitar a los productores agrupados en nodos regionales en temas agroclimáticos. En segundo lugar, se aprovechó la red de colaboración de los proyectos en ejecución para involucrar a los productores en las sesiones de la MTA, hacerles llegar el boletín y llevar a cabo actividades de extensión y seguimiento a las recomendaciones. De manera similar, aprovechando la información generada en la MTA, la SADER, a través de su brazo técnico INIFAP, fortaleció el proceso de extensión en el estado, llevando a cabo la capacitación de productores y la difusión de la información.

These peels are usually dumped near processing centres to rot or dry enough to be burned. Rotting heaps release methane into the air and a stinking effluent that pollutes nearby streams and underground water, while burning produces clouds of acrid smoke. However, when properly dried, peels can be an ingredient in animal feed. Previous attempts over two decades to use peels in animal feed failed to yield profitable options for drying wet peels at commercial scale, but recent research suggests that cassava peels can be processed into high-quality cassava peel (HQCP) products to be used as nutritious, low-cost animal feed ingredients by livestock feed suppliers and their customers (livestock-keepers)  ","339"
