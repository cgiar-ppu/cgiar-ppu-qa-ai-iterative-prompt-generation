  ""explanation"": ""This research result is primarily focused on gender equality. It centers on analyzing and developing methods to anticipate and address gender impacts when scaling agricultural innovations. The study specifically explores unique gender considerations, outlines key elements (such as team composition and communication), and provides practical methodologies aimed at ensuring socially inclusive, gender responsible scaling. These objectives align directly with CGIAR’s goal of closing the gender gap and creating opportunities for marginalized groups, so the research clearly meets the criteria for a 'Principal' (2) tag.""
