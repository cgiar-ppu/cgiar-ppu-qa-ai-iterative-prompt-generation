Climate changemay favour pest and disease development and further exacerbate the vulnerability of smallholder farming systems to biotic constraints. Information on effects of climate change on pests and pathogens of banana is required by policy
makers and researchers in designing control strategies and adaptation plans. Since altitude is inversely related to temperature, this study used the occurrence of key banana pests and diseases along an altitude gradient as a proxy for the potential impact of changes in temperature associated with global warming on pests and diseases. We assessed the occurrence of banana pests and diseases in 93 banana fields across three altitude ranges in Burundi and 99 fields distributed in two altitude ranges in Rwanda watersheds. Incidence and prevalence of Banana Bunchy Top Disease (BBTD) and Fusarium wilt (FW) was significantly associated with temperature and altitude in Burundi, revealing that increasing temperatures may lead to upward movement of banana diseases. No significant associations with temperature and altitude were observed for weevils,
nematodes and Xanthomonas wilt of banana (BXW). Data collected in this study provides a baseline to verify and guide modelling work to predict future pest and disease distribution according to climate change scenarios.

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Climate","Genomic regions involved in the control of 1,000-kernel weight in wild relative-derived populations of durum wheat Terminal drought is one of the most common and devastating climatic stress factors affecting durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) production worldwide. The wild relatives of this crop are deemed a vast potential source of useful alleles to adapt to this stress. A nested association mapping (NAM) panel was generated using as a recurrent parent the Moroccan variety ‘Nachit’ derived from Triticum dicoccoides and known for its large grain size. This was recombined to three top-performing lines derived from T. dicoccoides, T. araraticum, and Aegilops speltoides, for a total of 426 inbred progenies. This NAM was evaluated across eight environments (Syria, Lebanon, and Morocco) experiencing different degrees of terminal moisture stress over two crop seasons. Our results showed that drought stress caused on average 41% loss in yield and that 1,000-kernel weight (TKW) was the most important trait for adaptation to it. Genotyping with the 25K TraitGenetics array resulted in a consensus map of 1,678 polymorphic SNPs, spanning 1,723 cM aligned to the reference ‘Svevo’ genome assembly. Kinship distinguished the progenies in three clades matching the parent of origin. A total of 18 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified as controlling various traits but independent from flowering time. The most significant genomic regions were named Q.ICD.NAM-04, Q.ICD.NAM-14, and Q.ICD.NAM-16. Allelic investigation in a second germplasm panel confirmed that carrying the positive allele at all three loci produced an average TKW advantage of 25.6% when field-tested under drought conditions. The underlying SNPs were converted to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers and successfully validated in a third germplasm set, where they explained up to 19% of phenotypic variation for TKW under moisture stress. These findings confirm the identification of critical loci for drought adaptation derived from wild relatives that can now be readily exploited via molecular breeding.","1435"

A Comprehensive Review of Land Use, Food Systems, and Socio-Economic Drivers The drivers of deforestation and land use change in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes are complex and interconnected, shaped by various factors, including agricultural expansion, wood extraction, mining, infrastructure development, climate change, and socio-economic factors. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of these drivers and their impacts on the environment and local communities. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that accounts for both direct and underlying drivers and the unique context of each region. Effective management strategies must consider the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of these challenges. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving forest governance, empowering local communities, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders are crucial steps to protecting Peru’s natural resources. These measures can help balance economic development with environmental conservation, ensuring the sustainable use of land and resources. Equally important is addressing the underlying social and economic factors that drive land use change, including poverty, population growth, and migration. These factors often exacerbate environmental degradation and need to be integrated into broader development and conservation strategies.
A holistic approach that acknowledges the distinct challenges faced by the Amazon and Andean regions, can contribute to face deforestation as well as ensure the well-being of local communities, biodiversity conservation, and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. Such an approach requires coordinated efforts from government, non-governmental organizations, local communities, and international partners to create effective and sustainable solutions.","1281"

"10287","CLIMATE_CHANGE_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in addressing climate change. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific climate change objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to combat climate change by promoting climate mitigation, adaptation, and policy initiatives, particularly within the agriculture, forestry, and food systems sectors. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a climate change impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's climate change objectives, such as mitigation, adaptation, or policy.
  - The research is unrelated to climate change, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for climate-related outcomes.
  - Example: A study focused solely on agricultural yield improvement without considering its impact on climate change.

- **1 = Significant:** 
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s climate change objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into climate change, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on crop resilience, indirectly supporting climate adaptation.

- **2 = Principal:** 
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in climate change mitigation, adaptation, or policy.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific climate change objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop sustainable farming practices aimed explicitly at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Climate Mitigation:** Transforming agriculture and forest systems into a net carbon sink by 2050.
- **Climate Adaptation:** Equipping small-scale producers to be more resilient to climate impacts by 2030.
- **Climate Policy:** Supporting countries in implementing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and increasing ambition in climate actions by 2030.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in climate change by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “mitigation,” “adaptation,” “resilience,” or “climate policy.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s climate change objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in climate change.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s climate change objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in climate change, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions climate change as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If climate change mitigation, adaptation, or policy is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that climate change objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
