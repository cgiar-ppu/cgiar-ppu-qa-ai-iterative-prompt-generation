Farmers and Agricultural Extension Agents (AEAs) assessed the sustainability of the validated technologies in relation to conventional practices using the sustainable assessment framework as a guide. The validated technologies were:
i.	Cowpea living mulch for maize production
ii.	Maize-legume strip cropping system

More specifically, the workshop is also implemented to:
-Understand the main production constraints due to climate change impacts 
-Identify opportunities to address the problems 
-Assess the stakeholders in the province who are relevant for addressing the problems
-Discuss the map of the area and identify main crops planted

Moving forward, the current group will form the base of the alliance, but there will be additional relevant stakeholders linked as needed in the different topics of interest. These learning topics are derived from priorities and key observed constraints in the area.  ","308"

 1. Introduction  
Gender and other factors of social marginalization are central to the resilience and fairness of food 
systems and their stakeholders. At this juncture, responding to the wicked problems posed by climate 
change, COVID -19, the food crisis, and conflict will require complex systems -level solutions, which 
must be underpinned by gender equality and social inclusion. For CGIAR, 2022 is an important 
transitional year, as the consortium launches a new portfolio to achieve the goals set out in the 2030 
Research and Innovation Strategy .  
In its new role as a CGIAR Impact Platform, GENDER is mandated to set directions to enable CGIAR to 
generate maximum impact on gender equality, opportunities for youth, and social inclusion in 
agriculture and food systems by providing cutting -edge , robust evidence and methods and by setting 
strategic directions for current and future research efforts. To  serve this goal, GENDER brought 
together CGIAR researchers working toward the Gender Equality, Youth and Social Inclusion Impact 
Area for a three -day CGIAR GENDER  Science Exchange focused on gender and social inclusion in food, 
land , and water systems. Th e Science Exchange ran from October 12-14, 2022 , at the ILRI campus in 
Nairobi, Kenya.  
The exchange was organized by the CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform in the tradition of the annual 
CGIAR gender conferences. The Platform is committed to leading at least on e global convening per 
year – alternating each year between an internal planning and knowledge sharing meeting and an 
external conference.  Following the ‘external’ 2019 and 2021 conferences called ‘Seeds of Change’ and 
‘Cultivating Equality’, respectively,  the theme for this internal Science Exchange was ‘Rooting for 
Impact’.  
The Science Exchange was an important opportunity for researchers to learn from existing research, 
build on the significant work and legacies of the CGIAR centers and former CGIAR Rese arch Programs 
(CRPs), and enhance capacities for quality and impactful research that will advance CGIAR’s 2030 
development targets. Fruitful  and collaborative discussions centered on how to build more resilient 
and socially inclusive food systems through transformative gender research, with a focus on 
intersectional approaches, and contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5 (‘Achieve 
gender equality and empower all women and girls’).   
Sessions were held in -person, with plenaries streame d and posted online for virtual attendance.  
2. Science Exchange objectives  
CGIAR aims to be a leader in solution -building, and is well positioned to generate innovative and 
empirically supported solutions by bringing together scientists with diverse focuses a nd backgrounds. 
To this end, the Science Exchange aimed to foster connection, collaboration, and synergistic solution -
building among gender scientists across CGIAR. The event offered a venue for conversation, 
collaboration, and cross -pollination of ideas a nd initiatives between scientists working across different 
sectors and at different levels of food systems research. Through knowledge -sharing and interactive 
spaces, the Science Exchange aimed to move forward the agenda of intersectional gender research i n 
agriculture and food systems, with the following targeted outcomes : 
• Advancements and innovations in research, concepts, frameworks and methodologies on 
gender, youth , and social inclusion in relation to food systems research linked to social 
change.  
Page 6:

 • A shared understanding of existing assets and critical future research serv ing the impact 
area.  
• Enhanced knowledge and capacities, particularly among early -career gender researchers, to 
conduct and integrate conceptually robust, cutting -edge, high -quality , and impactful gender 
and social inclusion research, and to communicate effectively about their science.  
• Strengthened social capital and foundations to build collaborati ons among CGIAR gender 
researchers to enable maximum impact on gender equality, social inclusion , and 
opportunities for youth.  
• Improved knowledge of the CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform and use of its resources (e.g., 
the resource hub) among participants.  
The event also served as a relaunch of the GENDER Platform  as a CGIAR Impact Platform, which 
expands the platform ’s mandate beyond gender to include youth and social inclusion. The Science 
Exchange provided an essential convening space for the first in -person event of its kind since the 
COVID -19 pandemic. As Marlène Elias, lead of the platform’s Alliances module, sai d in the opening 
plenary, the event would “not only nourish ourselves intellectually and improve our research, but will 
provide the emotional and moral support that we need to do the difficult job we do.”  
3.  Working principles  
Three working principles were e stablished to meet Science Exchange objectives:  
• Provide a  collaborative, internal space for CGIAR researchers to have open exchanges, offer 
constructive criticism, set directions , and create connections.  
• Focus on cutting -edge, high -quality science that c an enable CGIAR to achieve its ambitious 
goals on gender equality, youth , and social inclusion.  
• Enable e arly-career researchers and a diverse group of researchers from different centers and 
geographies to actively participate.  
4. Themes  
Through a call for contributions issued on May 30, 2022  (Annex 1), participants were invited to submit 
abstracts related to gender equality, youth, and social inclusion in food systems and on equitable food, 
land , and water system s transformations. Contrib utors were encouraged to include intersectional 
perspectives that surface the most relevant aspects of social exclusion/inclusion to link research with 
the five CGIAR Impact Areas :   
1. Nutrition, health , and food security  
2. Poverty reduction, livelihoods , and jobs  
3. Gender equality, youth , and inclusion  
4. Climate adaptation and mitigation  
5. Environmental health and biodiversity

 Contributions were grouped thematically into 14 sessions, listed in Section 5 . 
5. Organization   
A planning  committee was responsible for providing strategic leadership, developing the aims and 
objectives and call for contributions, establishing and coordinating the scientific committee, creating 
the program , and organizing most of the plenaries. A scientific committee comprising  seven members 
across CGIAR centers was tasked with reviewing the abstracts and session submissions. An online 
workshop organized on July 6, 2022 , brought members together to collaborate towards this end. A 
logistics team organized the practical aspects of the event , from helping participants with travel , 
accommodation,  and visa arrangements to providing meals and leisure activity options  to participants . 
A communications and outreach team  coordinate d all communications -related aspects of the 
Exchange , which are presented in Section 7 . Members of all committees are listed in Annex 2.  
6. The program  
The call for contributions (Annex 1) was disseminated  through the GENDER Platform’s gender 
researchers ’ listserv , which includes gender researchers across CGIAR , and to  recipients of GENDER 
Platform grants . The invitation was also extended to researchers from Gender -responsive  Researchers  
Equipped  for Agricultural  Transformation  (GREAT)  – a collaborative partnership between Makerere 
University in Uganda , Cornell University in the United States , and the CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform  
aimed at advancing gender -responsive research within national and international agricultural 
research institutions.  Contributors were invit ed to submit an abstract of their research for 
presentation or to submit a proposal for a capacity strengthening session.  
The call yielded 70 submissions for oral presentation s and 6 proposals for capacity -strengthening 
sessions , which took a deep dive on gender research tools, methodologies , and conceptual 
frameworks.  The Scientific Committee assessed all abstracts . The Science  Exchange’s  three -day 
program  (Annex 3) ultimately comprised 6 capacity -strengthening sessions  and 53 presentations 
grouped into 14 sessions .  
The capacity strengthening sessions, which were led by different CGIAR center researchers on Day 1, 
focused on:  
1. Measuring empowerment in agricultural development projects using pro -WEAI  
2. Gender Based Analysis Plus: A strengthened approach to gender integration and 
inter sectionality  
3. Can communities of practice help us accelerate and improve our gender research?  
4. How does the measurement of youth empowerment differ from women’s empowerment?   
5. Take it from experienced authors! Practical tips for publishing a scientific articl e 
6. How to use: GenderUp, a conversational method for gender -responsible scaling

7. Into the ‘black box’: Methods and evidence for understanding intra -household decision -
making  
8. Gender in marke t systems and entrepreneurship  
9. Masculinities and femininities in farming systems  
10. Methodological innovations: Indexes, ethics, and frameworks for gender research

A book of abstracts  provides an overview of the presentations and capacity -strengthening sessions, 
and the program  shows the orga nization of the parallel sessions , panel discussions and plenaries. Links 
to the slides of all presentations and capacity building sessions  were subsequently posted on the 
Science Exchange microsite, at: https://gender.cgiar.org/conferences/gender -science -exchange -
2022 . As detailed below, e ach day also featured  one or more  plenary session (s), which were streamed 
and posted online for asynchronous viewing (relevant links listed in Annex 4). 
On Day 1, Science Exchange host Vivian Atakos from the CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform kicked off 
the event and introduced the opening plenary , which  inaugurated  the Science Exchange with a 
welcome and re -launch of the GENDER Impact Platform  presented by Claudia Sadoff, Executive 
Managing Director (CGIAR); Jimmy Smith, Director General (ILRI); Nicoline de Haan, Director (CGIAR 
GENDER Impact Platform); and Marl ène Elias, CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform Alliances Module Lead. 
The welcoming plenary  was followed by a panel discussion with four young agricultural entrepreneurs 
from Kenya: Nyambura Simiyu, Urban Gardener, Digital Content Creator; Jannette C. Toroitich, 
Agripreneur; Alphaxrd Gitau, Director, Alpham Fresh Limited; and Wangari Kuria, C.E. O, Farmer on 
Fire Global Consultancy. These emerging  leaders shared their experiences as young people in 
agriculture and offered fresh perspectives on the empowerment  of youth and their role in food 
systems .

 A cocktail was held at the ILRI campus at t he e nd of Day 1 to bring together participants and invited 
partners in celebration of  the opening of the Science Exchange and  to allow for informal interactions, 
relationship -building , and networking.  
On Day 2, the opening plenary focused on the GENDER Impact Platform’s new mandate .  
The Science Exchange concluded on Day 3 with a  closing pane l discussion about the relevance of 
CGIAR gender and inclusion research in times of global crises . Moderated b y Claudia Ringler (IFPRI), 
the panel included Margaret Najjingo Mangheni (Makerere University  - GREAT ), Elisabeth Garner 
(CIFOR ), Hanna Ewell ( GIZ), and Shreya Chakraborty (IWMI).  
As part of each day’s opening plenary session, visual facilitator Harriet Matsaert led participants in 
creative exercises  to reflect on and artistically represent their gender in food systems research using 
the metaphor of a farm (‘If you r research was par t of a farm, what would it be?’). These exercises 
resulted in a mural , pictured in Annex 5, and a video detailing the process .  
7. Communications   
The communications and outreach plan  (Annex 6) set out to accomplish four main objectives:  
 
1. Create awareness of the CGIAR GENDER  Impact Platform, its core mandate , and how CGIAR 
researchers and partners can engage . 
2. Ensure a shared understanding within the CGIAR  community of existing assets and critical 
future research to be able to serve the impact area.   
3. Actively engage CGIAR researchers in disseminating new evidence, tools , and methods from 
the CGIAR GENDER Platform . 
4. Improve knowledge about availability and us e of GENDER Platform resources (e.g., the 
resource hub) and increase support among participants.   
 
Key audiences included: CGIAR researchers  working on or interested in gender, youth , and social 
inclusion, and CGIAR management and platform donors.  
 
Being a mostly internal event , information about the Exchange  was disseminated using various 
avenues including the CGIAR GENDER website event page , newsletters  (CGIAR’s The Feed  and CGIAR 
GENDER ), direct email, and via CGIAR GENDER  D-groups . Event branding entailed preparati on of 
visuals  including social media cards, banners, event holding slides for breaks, and welcome banner s 
among others. The sample of these visuals is shown in Figure 1.

Twitter posts related to the Science Exchange received a positive level of interactivity, including 
messages sent out by some of young in fluential farmers who took part in the opening panel, as well 
as other participants. Over the 3 -day Exchange period, live tweets made over 13,500 impressions, with 
an engagement rate of 4.2%. Figure 2 shows how some of our top tweets performed, including o ne 
shared by Jannette Toroitich, who was part of the young farmer’s panel.

A micro -site ( https://gender.cgiar.org/conferences/gender -science -exchange -2022 ) on the GENDER 
Impact Platform website was created to bring together key information about the Science Exchange, 
including the event announcement, the  agenda, book of abstracts, recordings of selecte d sessions, 
presentations and summary blogs from the session. The Science Exchange was also documented 
through photos, which are available on the CGIAR GENDER Flickr page .  
The communication and outreach plan was executed by Nathan Ronoh, Joshua Maraka, Marianne 
Gadeberg and Vivian Atakos (conference moderator).

 8. Content review  
Addressing  the theme of the Science Exchange , “Rooting for Impact,” t he below review of session 
content is organized according to the five CGIAR impact areas : 1) nutrition, healt h, and food security; 
2) poverty reduction, livelihoods , and jobs; 3) gender equality, youth , and inclusion; 4) climate 
adaptation and mitigation; and 5) environmental health and biodiversity . While all presentations 
speak to gender equality, youth , and inclusion, most address these dimensions as they intersect with 
one or more of the other four impact areas , and are organized below under the other primary area to 
which they relate . The review is based on reports from each session provided by the session 
rapporteurs (listed in Annex 2).  
a. Nutrition, health , and food security  
Issues of gender and agricultural technology adoption  for food security and climate resilience  were a 
popular  topic at the Science Exchange  (sessions Thu 1.1, Thu 2.3, Fri 1.3, Fri 2.2 ). Presenters  surfaced 
that women and men adopt different  agricultural  technologies to differ ent extents and for different 
reasons , which need to be explored and considered with equal weight for equity in food security 
interventions. As such , inclusive co-creation of breeding strategies and participatory varietal selection 
are extremely important for gender -responsive adoption strategies (Fri 2.2) . Gender equality and 
inclusion are also crucial for the longevity of adaptation interventions, as women’s decision -making 
power is positively correlated with sustained use of improved crop varie ties (Thu 1.1).  
The way s in which new technologies and varieties are introduced also matter for adoption; for 
example, a study with women cassava farmers in Kenya found that women preferred to receive 
extension services and advice from women extension age nts (Fri 2.2). Trade -offs must also be 
considered; when women are given improved seeds or technologies for improved yield and 
productivity, this can exacerbate inequalities, with men and elites taking control of the technology 
and/or the income it produces  while women’s (often unpaid) drudgery increases (Fri 2.2). There was 
little discussion of intersectional dimensions  beyond gender  as pertains to adoption, but this was 
flagged as  need ing further exploration.  
The Friday closing panel highlighted the need to empirically validate agricultural innovations and tools 
before trying to scale them. Scaling itself can also easily aggravate inequalities and food insecurity by 
providing unequal benefits and trade -offs for  men and women if not carried out in a gender -
responsive way. GenderUp, a tool for responsible scaling that entails  socially inclusive targeting and 
anticipation of negative effects and trade -offs, among other factors, was presented as tool for 
mitigating this risk  (Wed 3.2).  
Issues of nutrition, health, and food security are particularly salient in the current context of the triple 
crises of COVID -19, climate change, and conflict  (the ‘three C’s’). A session on shocks and stressors (Fri 
1.3) demonstrated  that the impacts of the three C’s, and coping strategies to deal with them, are 
highly gendered. Food insecurity can have far -reaching and intergenerational impacts on 
(dis)empowerment, especially for poor populations and women and girls. For example, in several 
contexts, high inflation rates from the war in Ukraine and erosion  of savings due to  COVID -19 has led 
to younger marriage ages for girls in poor families, which in turn leads to lower formal education rates 
for women, lower birth weights for childre n, and compromised  health and  nutrition for the whole 
household, among other barriers to development  (Fri 1.3) . While evidence about gendered 
vulnerabilities to shocks  is plentiful , much less attention has been paid to responses to shocks as they 
relate to gender issues (Fri 3.3). Furthermore, w hile many presenters discussed the gendered impact s 
of climate on food security, the Friday closing panel pointed out that less attention  was given  to 
conflict , suggesting that there  is a gap in this regard .

 b. Poverty reduction, livelihoods , and jobs  
Achieving gender parity in value chains will increase production and provide more women with more 
income, but will it lead to women’s empowerment? Even in areas where women are heavily involved 
in value chains (VCs) and have high rates of entrepreneurship, they still tend to earn less than men . 
Women are concentrated in lower remunerated VC nodes, and are paid less than men even when 
working in the s ame capacity (Thu 1.2). Indeed, even the way “business” is defined is often gendered . 
As one session (Fri 2.1) demonstrated, men often receive remuneration  to provide the same services 
that women are expected to do for free , meaning that a women’s ‘duty’ c an be a man’s ‘business’ . As 
such, w omen’s benefits from VCs and entrepreneurship need to be measured beyond economic 
indicators  to include empowerment measures. In addition, t he relationship between empowerment 
and market inclusion  needs to be further explored as it relates to different social groups  (Thu 1.2) . 
To this end, a  new tool, the Women’s Empowerment Index for Market Inclusion (pro -WEAI+MI), 
measures women’s empowerment as it relates to stages and actors in identified VCs by introducing 
novel instrumental agency indicators (e.g., input in main VC decisions, control over use of income and 
outputs from the main VC, empowerment environment ) (Thu 2.2). However, some discussions 
critiqued  the compartmentalizing approach of lookin g at gender and empowerment through specific 
value chains, market sectors, commodities, etc., as this could reinforce shoehorning tokenized  gender 
aspect s into existing projects instead of building a gender -responsive approach from the bottom up.  
Some drivers of productivity and inclusive value chain development have been identified as: g ender -
responsive capacity development, promoting positive gender norms , and stemming declining access 
to publicly funded extension  and technology uptake (Thu 1.2) . In terms of capacity development, 
initiatives should be careful not to make assumptions about what men and women want to learn 
about through training.  In a Tunisi an study of skill-building in livestock management, women were 
trained on matters that corresponded to ‘women’s work ’ but wanted to be trained on marketing and 
drought adaptation, which were locally  considered to be men’s domain  (Fri 2.3).  
Presenters also  highlighted pitfalls in gender -responsive funding strategies . Several sessions surfaced 
that in many cases  of micro -financing and credit schemes targeted directly to  women,  their husbands 
decide  how the money  is spent . As such, men  often  spend  this money on their own interest s, leaving 
debt in their wives’ names  and increasing women’s financial burdens instead of alleviating them (Thu 
2.3, Thu 3.1).   
In many contexts around the world, m igration has become an increasingly large part of both rural and 
urban livelihoods. Present ers explored the complex impacts of two forms of migration – out-migration 
of men, and migration of women themselves  – on women’s empowerment . Empowerment  
experience s are also mediated by the form of migration  (e.g.,  permanent, cyclical, long , short, near , 
far). Presenters pointed out that women ’s migrat ion can actually reduce their  empowerment 
depending on their new positionality in the social hierarchy in their arrival destination  (Thu 3.2). In 
contexts where men have migrated to urban areas, leaving family plots typically  managed by men in 
the hands of women , this dynamic  can caus e a break from gender norms  and offer a pathway to 
gender -transformative change, or , conversely (especially in cases of short -term or seasonal 
migration) , leave women in a custodial context with only temporary and secondary decision -making 
power  to be  cede d to men upon their return (Thu 2.1, Thu 3.2).

 c. Gender equality, youth , and inclusion  
Many sessions and presenters challenged gender binaries in research design. Scientists are now taking 
a closer look at different and diverse masculinities and femininities as they relate to food systems, and 
the ways in which what it means to “be a man” or “be a woman” are constantly renegotiated. Over 
the past decade, research has moved away from focusing on “women and agriculture” to look at 
“gender in agricul ture” (Thu 3.3), indicating a positive trend toward a more holistic and nuanced view, 
but there is still progress to be made in this regard. Studies should explore local understandings of 
gender instead of presuming to know what a “man” or a “woman” is in a certain context (Thu 2.1). 
There is a need to look at masculinities across multiple levels, and how these are produced and 
reinforced across agricultural institutions (Thu 2.1). Furthermore, men (as a heterogeneous group) 
must be included in studies of g ender and empowerment in food systems instead of focusing on 
women’s empowerment alone (Wed 1.1) . 
Too often, false binaries of men’s work and women’s work, and men’s crops and women’s crops, 
dictate study designs . Jointly managed plots are common but decis ion-making dynamics among those 
managing them are poorly understood. There is a need for more nuanced studies which examine the 
varying levels of jointness as they are underpinned by local power dynamics (Thu 1.1). Jointness is 
complex; different household s have different experience s with joint decision -making and joint 
management, where men’s and women’s voice s, priorities and knowledge are often distinct, 
overlapping, or competing (Thu 1.1).  
Several participants  presented i nnovative approaches for transf orming gendered  intra -household 
decision -making  processes, including through  the use of forum theatre in Bangladesh (Fri 2.1) and 
vignettes in India (Thu 1.1) . Such approaches  allowed men and women to broach and challenge taboo 
topics and deep -seated cultu ral norms . However, it should be considered that interventions that 
subvert cultural norms of gender performance risk backlash (Thu 2.1 , Fri 1.2 ). 
Indeed, questions of ethics in gender research to address and account for such tensions were 
prevalent. An  increased demand for guidance on ethics in gender research led to the development of 
a new CGIAR toolkit for handing sensitive topics in research, which also surfaced further ethical 
considerations for future guidelines, including  on gender -based  violence ( GBV ), addressing tensions 
between external and local research priorities, and truly anonymiz ing data (Thu 2.2).  
While many presenters pointed to the importance of an intersectional approach, in line with the aims 
and themes of the event, gender was the dominant consideration throughout the Science Exchange . 
A capacity development session on Gender Based Analysis (GBA) Plus (Wed 1.2), however, warned of 
the dangers of assum ing the primordial importance of gender as compared to other axes of identity, 
as this may create a biased study.  
Other than gender, the most common social dimension considered was age, with a focus on studies  
focused specifically on youth. However, it became clear that t he definition of “youth” must be further 
explored, as it changes greatly across  contexts and social groups  (Wed 2.2, Thu 3.2). Participants 
discussed whether  youth should be understood as a stage of life (rather than an age group) wherein 
one is no longer a child but does not yet have their own children . They cautioned, however, that  in 
such a conceptualization, many women who leave their parents’ home to marry into their husband’s 
would never be considered ‘youth ’ and may thus be excluded from youth -focused studies and 
initiatives (Wed 2.2, Thu 3.2). As a heterogeneous group with vary ing aspirations, initiatives to 
empower youth should look to the youth themselves to define what empowerment  means to them , 
and consider their “orientations towards a desired future” or aspirations, which are often 
incompatible with their opportunities (Th u 3.2). The Wednesday youth panel with featured young 
Kenyan entrepreneurs underscored the importance of co -creation of research and policy that include 
Page 15:
14 
 
 youth voices. While agriculture policy aimed at youth is typically designed to keep youth in agricultur e, 
the empowerment of youth calls for policy that allows them to move in and out of agriculture as they 
see fit (Thu 3.2).  
Finally, a session on gender mainstreaming and doing gender research (Fri 1.1) reflected that despite 
broad donor and institutional support for gender mainstreaming, its success as a transformative tool 
is questionable . Presenters challenged  the idea that hiring a gender expert as an institution’s  sole 
gender focal point is enough to create a feminist transformation, which rather leads to  the nomina","7859"

The WEFE nexus approach realizes that the management of water, energy, food, and ecosystems must be undertaken in a holistic way. Nevertheless, governments, investors, and other stakeholders face challenges in the management of WEFE resources, particularly in the face of climate change. Notably, a lack of coordination in utilizing such resources can be a source of potential conflict in many areas. On June 19 and 20, 2022, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the Department of Water Resources and Irrigation (DWRI) co-organized a co-learning workshop to discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrated management of WEFE resources using the nexus thinking approach in Nepal.

Background  
Within Nepal, Water, Energy, Food, and Ecosystems (WEFE) are vital resources  not merely for the current 
generation , but also for future ones , especially to satisfy the demands  of a growing population and to 
respond to socio -economic changes. WEFE are highly interconnected systems critical to food and nutrition 
security, livelihoods, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and environmental health. The WEFE 
nexus approach real izes that the management of water, energy, food, and ecosystems must be 
undertaken  in a holistic way. Internalizing such ‘nexus thinking’  is key to achieving the objectives of the  
CGIAR’s NEXUS Gains Initiative  as well as the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for Nepal.  
Nevertheless , governments, investors, and other stakeholders face challenges in the  management of  
WEFE resources in a holistic way, particularly in the face of climate change.  Notably, a l ack of coordination 
in utilizing such resources can be a source of potential conflict in many areas. Being vulnerable to climatic 
changes , the impact area  is cross -sectoral and therefore better management of these interconnected 
resources  is essential .  
On June 19 and 20, 2022, the Internation al Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the Department of 
Water Resources and Irrigation (DWRI) co -organized a co -learning workshop to discuss the challenges and 
opportunities of integrated management of WEFE resources using  the nexus thinking  approach  in Nepal. 
The workshop was part of CGIAR’s NEXUS Gains Initiative, which aims to improve the integrated 
management of water, energy, food, land, biodiversity, and forests for inclusive sustainable development 
in a climate crisis.  
Technical session  
During t he 1.5-day event, over 25 national and international experts and stakeholders from DWRI, 
Department of Agriculture (DOA), National Agriculture Research Council (NARC), Water Resources 
Research and Development Centre (WRRDC)  and Ground Water Resources Development Board (GWRDB), 
among others, engaged in dialogue  through presentations and interactive group discussions  (Figure 1) . 
The workshop helped foster learning and understanding of the WEFE nexus among participants 
represen ting the WEFE sectors in Nepal.  The details of the participants  and the agenda  are enclosed in 
Annex I and II respectiv ely.

Dhulikhel.  
In her inaugural speech, Dr. Manohara Khadka, Country Representative of IWMI Nepal, highlighted the 
increasing pressure on WEFE resources  due to climate change , hindering the sustainable management of 
water and food security. She added, “DWRI is revising the Irrigation Policy (2013) in view of the 
implementation of federalism in Nepal. Therefore, a co -learning workshop providing details of WEFE 
resources management concepts using nexus thinking and approaches is timely. This discussion in tends 
to provide an opportunity to learn about the WEFE nexus and incorporate relevant approaches into 
relevant policies.”  
Mr. Susheel Chandra Acharya, the Director General of DWRI remarked , “Water resources are the major 
entity for food security, natural and ecosystem balance, and energy, and are the foundation for Nepal’s 
economic and social development. Water resource availability is enough in Nepal, but its timely and 
adequate delivery and its governance are a challenging task.”  He added, “ Based  on international research 
and practices, I am expecting this workshop to be a good knowledge -sharing platform. Irrigation Policy is 
in formulation stage and the discussions during the workshop will help to realize nexus between irrigation 
and other sector s, which would ultimately help the development of Nepal.”  
While briefing the participants about the program overview, Dr. Santosh Nepal, Researcher of Water 
Resources and Climate Change,  IWMI, elaborated:  “This workshop is a co -learning opportunity with 
experts from WEFE sectors in Nepal as we would have equal opportunity to learn from each other, to 
learn together, and to work together.”  
Ten presentations were delivered by a range of renowned  nexus experts and water management 
professionals ; they provided  unique inputs on the WEFE nexus  and its significance for resource -related 
policies.  Participants gained a general understanding of the approach , including opportunities and 
challenges related to its implementation. Insights into the value of WEFE nexus approach  to ensure water,

energy , and food security in  Nepal’s  most vulnerable regions were further shared, setting the scene for 
the rest of the workshop.   
Dr. Tafadzwa nashe  Mabhaudhi (Research Group Leader  – Sustainable, and Resilient Food Systems ) noted 
the implications of irrigation modernization and nexus -friendly irrigation modernization pathways for 
different climatic zones , distinguishing the performance of  silo-based irrigation systems from integrated 
nexus performance. He concluded , “Drip irrigation is a more sustainable irrigation technology in terms of 
optimizing water, energy, and food efficiency and  the best transitio n is moving from drip followed by 
furrow and sprinkler in a tropical climate. ” Dr. Stefan Uhlenbrook, Leader -CGIAR NEXUS Gains  initiative 
described the nexus approach:  “IWRM (Integrated Water Resources Management)  is a water -centric  
approach which has linkages to navigation, energy, tourism, ecosystem, cities, and food production. But 
a nexus approach is different. It puts water, energy, food,  and e cosystems  on the same  footing. It is not 
about optimizing water management only but at the same time understanding the synergies and trade -
offs with other sectors: optimizing food and nutritional security, energy security, and environmental 
health and biodiversity  at the same time . They are all equally important so we should move on from a 
water -centric approach to a much more systems  approach.”  
Participants were divided into two groups, conducting  interactive group discussions on Strengths, 
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) of existing policies for incorporating nexus thinking and 
approaches  (Figure 2) . The Irrigation Policy and National Agricultural Policy were used as examples of 
pote ntial areas of nexus approach integrat ion within different sectoral policies. The discussion was 
facilitated by Dr. Devendra Gauchan, Senior Research Fellow, Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT. 
It allowed  the groups to identif y a provision for G ender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI), multipurpose 
irrigation projects, and strengthening Water User Associations (WUAs) concepts as strengths, while 
climate change and lack of WEFE nexus  concept and  tariff collection were ascertained to be  major 
wea kness es of the Irrigation Policy 2070. Similarly, for National Agricultural Policy 2061, ecosystem 
conservation, food, and agricultural productivity concepts, including GESI provisions, were recognized as 
major strengths, but a lack of thorough  focus on wa ter and energy, linkages to crops, and post -harvest 
processes were seen as significant weaknesses. In addition, the group found that Policy, Energy, and 
Ecosystems are the specific areas where nexus  thinking in Nepal  can be internalized . The specific conte xt 
to be added to the irrigation policy is water productivity enhancement targeted over the irrigated area, 
the need for an irrigation ecosystem, and institutional strengthening of WUA ( i.e., who is doing what). In 
the energy sector, multiple uses and targ eted subsidy mechanisms for smallholders should be highlighted . 
Lastly, issues of land restoration, linkages between soil conservation and irrigation, and compensation for 
water -induced disasters are a few of the major aspects to be considered in the ecosy stem.

FIGURE 2. Group Discussion on SWOT analysis of existing policies for integrating nexus thinking . 
Subsequently , Dr. Manohara Khadka and  Ms. Gitta Shrestha (Researcher , IWMI ), set forth the 
opportunities and challenges for gender -just and socially inclusive management of the WEFE nexus in 
Nepal. During th is session, participants examined the gender continuum s which  best described their 
ongoing  work . Participants of the first group found Community Managed Irrigated Agricultural Sector 
Project (CMIASP -AF) to be a ‘gender -responsive ’ project. In the second group, the Priority River Basins 
Flood Risk Management Project (PRBFRMP) was noted to be ‘gender -responsive ’, and the Prime Ministe r 
Agriculture Modernization Program (PM -AMP) (Banana Zone) was identified to be a ‘ GESI transformative ’ 
program . 
Marking the end of the first day, Mr. Sunil Singh (Senior Agri -Economist, DOA ) highlighted the 
departments’ five plan s of action  for sustainable agriculture : a) Management and Coordination, b)  
Linkages and Communications, c)  Implementation  support and facilitation, d)  Enabling Environment , 
Policy , and Institutions , and lastly , e) Technical Support. In addition,  his presentation als o notably touched 
upon the Smart Village Program Model.  
The second day  of the workshop was commenced by  Mr. Sanjeeb Baral, Deputy Director General (DDG) 
of DWRI . His presentation highlighted  the revised irrigation policy , along with  the need for a new policy  
— one where the three tiers of government emphasize  the development of large, multipurpose, and basin 
diversion projects in a sustainable way. This is aimed to  address water security issues, promote energy -

based irrigation develo pment with irrigation management, and safeguard and guarantee water rights. 
Some of the highlights of the discussion  included  the goal of irrigation to be energy -efficient to increase 
production and productivity with less environmental pollution.  
Similarl y, Dr. Nirman Shrestha and Ms. Labisha Uprety from IWMI Nepal elucidated the challenges within 
agricultural water management in Nepal as well as opportunities for irrigation development , noting 
distinct sets of opportunities and barriers from a biophysical  and socio -economic perspective. Elements 
of policy and governance, public and private sector interventions and GESI in irrigation must be considered 
together to create an ecosystem for inclusive and sustainable farmer -led irrigation development. The 
subsequent discussion looked at t he challenges and opportunities of agricultural water managemen t. The 
workshop p articipants highlighted several hindering factors such as limited data on surface water, 
upstream and groundwater, use of older technology and software manuals, and lack of land/water 
ownership as the major barriers. The main  opportunities identified included a climate adaptation plan, a 
new irrigation policy, and water harvesting and conservation scaling for the rainfed system.   
Finally, Dr. Claudia Ringler from the International Food Policy Re search Institute (IFPRI), co -lead of NEXUS 
Gains, underscored  the importance of policy coherence for the nexus approach . She augmented the 
discussion by  illustrating  the example of the Eastern Nile on trade -offs and synergies for regional 
cooperation.  
At the end of the workshop, Dr. Manohara Khadka remarked that the workshop was a base to understand 
the degree of  WEFE thinking among the relevant stakeholders ; he appreciated the nexus -centered 
conversation to create momentum and drive interest . Mr. Pradeep Thapa (Deputy Director General , 
DWRI ) highlighted the significance and novelty of nexus thinking . He observed  that the workshop allowed 
the department to be sensitized about WEFE, with  the feedback received from the two days  to be 
incorporated  in the upcoming policy. The workshop concluded with the p articipants expressing their 
interest in  joining  further comprehensive training  in the future , engaging with the sustainable 
development of the WEFE nexus.

About Gender-responsive Researchers Equipped for 
Agricultural Transformation (GREAT)
GREAT equips researchers to create more inclusive and effective 
agricultural systems by addressing the priorities of both women and 
men originally in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), expanding to South Asia.
GREAT delivers courses to agricultural researchers from sub-Saharan 
Africa in the theory and practice of gender-responsive research, seeking 
to increase opportunities for equitable participation and the sharing 
of benefits from agricultural research and improve the outcomes for 
smallholder women farmers, entrepreneurs, and farmer organizations. 
By building and engaging communities of researchers equipped with 
the skills, knowledge, and support systems to develop and implement 
gender-responsive projects, GREAT will advance gender-responsiveness as 
the norm and standard for agricultural research. GREAT is supported with 
funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 
Phase 1 (2015-2021) was a  collaboration between Cornell University 
in Ithaca, New York and Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda; and 
Phase 2 (2021-2022), partnership expanded to include the CGIAR GENDER 
Platform through the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI).

The GREAT Vision
The GREAT vision is based on a premise that agricultural research 
projects are often designed with little consideration of how the 
research outputs, technologies and interventions will impact both 
men and women. Researchers are increasingly expected to design 
projects that deliver equitable outcomes, yet there is only limited or 
inappropriate gender training out there for agricultural researchers. 
Considering gender in research requires thinking differently, and 
not just applying tools. GREAT will not only teach participants how 
to use tools, but also how to change the way they look at their 
research, to be able to identify relevant gender research questions, 
or potential points of negative or positive impact for women and 
men, and how to address these. 
What we strive for is changing researchers and research systems. 
If GREAT can change the agricultural research paradigm so that 
gender is the lens through which all projects are conceptualized As co-Principal Investigators of the Gender-responsive Researchers 
Equipped for Agricultural Transformation (GREAT) project, we warmly 
welcome you to join us in our efforts to elevate gender-responsiveness 
in the agricultural research community.
We have a GREAT vision:
To equip researchers to create 
more inclusive and effective 
agricultural systems by addressing 
the priorities of both women and 
men in sub-Saharan Africa.

Hale Ann Tufan Margaret Najjingo Mangheniand implemented, research outputs will be more appropriate 
to the needs of both women and men farmers, and more 
widely adopted. Women will gain greater visibility and voice in 
agricultural research design and implementation.
All of this would culminate in increased benefits from agricultural 
research for men, women and children together.
The challenge in developing truly applied gender training courses 
for agricultural researchers bound GREAT proponents together, 
building a community of passionate supporters. We are indebted 
to the many visionary voices that have contributed intellectual 
input into the development of GREAT, and thank everyone who 
has generously devoted time, thoughts and resources to the 
GREAT vision.
Rhetoric around gender-responsive research is not new, but 
action and evidence is what is lacking. With GREAT intervention, 
we hope that the usual process of paying lip-service to gender 
without linking it to concrete commitments of time, budgets and 
personnel will change. Change is our greatest challenge. We hope 
you will join us as agents of change to implement this new vision 
of agricultural research to intelligently design research projects 
that maximize impact for all.
Thank you for joining the GREAT vision!

GREAT Offerings 
|Cohort Courses
Intensive, Applied, Transformative. 
The GREAT Project is centered around a unique 
course design.
GREAT courses are not like other gender trainings. 
We go far beyond gender sensitization, equipping 
researchers from diverse backgrounds with the 
skills to design and deliver research projects that 
result in better adoption, and more equitable and 
impactful results for the communities they serve.

Page 10:
What is the GREAT Approach?
GREAT courses are designed to make it easier for researchers to incorporate gender into 
their projects. We demystify gender, and provide social and biophysical scientists the 
theory, knowledge, tools and analytical approaches they need to bring gender into their 
research programs in a more grounded, realistic manner. Participants walk away better 
equipped to work together to increase adoption rates, and deliver equitable results that 
benefit men, women and children, across different crop value chains.
GREAT’s unique approach to gender training allows researchers of different backgrounds to 
work fluidly together, to design, carry out and deliver research projects as integrated teams. 
This enables more effective project management and development of more inclusive 
and effective technologies, which leads to better adoption and enhanced outcomes for 
farmers, value chain actors and consumers – including women, men and children.Theory and Knowledge. GREAT courses are grounded in applied 
gender theory. Participants learn how to use this knowledge 
to frame their research appropriately, and put it to work for the 
communities they serve.
Research Tools. GREAT courses cover mixed methods research, 
helping researchers select, design and use tools in a holistic, 
integrated fashion, that will help them learn the needs, desires and 
constraints of different value chain actors.
Analysis and Implementation. GREAT courses cover quantitative 
and qualitative data analysis methods, helping research teams 
unpack key themes and learnings from their field work, and 
translate these into research that delivers more equitable and 
effective results.
Icons: flaticon.com / Devon JenkinsInterdisciplinarity. GREAT doesn’t aim to turn biophysical scientists 
into gender experts, or social scientists into crop breeders. Instead, 
it equips social and biophysical scientists with the skills and 
perspective to work better together towards common goals.1, 2, 3...
a, b, c...Whole Cycle Approach. GREAT courses examine gender through 
each step of the research cycle, from start to finish, helping 
researchers both better compete for grant funding, and seamlessly 
integrate gender into their research, from proposal to publication.

“The training has enriched my understanding of the practice 
of gender inclusion. It is not merely having women and men 
participating, it is considering the interaction between the two 
outside of the project, and identifying potential opportunities 
that we can use to achieve the goals of the project. ”

 1. Introduction  
Two days intensive training was given to district agricultural officers, kebele level agricultural 
extension experts and performer model farmers that came from four different districts of the 
country (Annex I). Prior to the training, trainees were selected  from Meket district  in North Wollo 
and Basona Worena  district of North Shewa in Amhara region ; Gimbich district  of East Shewa in 
Oromia region  and Lemo district  of Hadiya Zone in South nations, nationalities and people’s  
region  (SNNPR). Groups were formed having at least one member from all districts to know each 
other, share experiences and the like. Dejene Kassahun has introduced the goals of the training and 
presented the contents in detail.  Accordingly, the  objectives of the training were: 1) to build 
adequate capacity and create strong linkage/collaboration among professionals at different 
hierarchy with in the same district where the SI -MFS project is planned to be implemented; 2) to 
introduce the project activities to be implemented ; 3) to widen perspectives as the south -north 
partners meet and discuss together; 4) build strong collaboration and sense of ownership all the 
line from the project leaders to the farmers. The trainings were highly participatory expressed by 
the group disc ussions, group reflection through reports/presentation as well as questions and 
answers at each training topics and during the group presentation times. The trainee s were highly 
satisfied by the training and motivated to perform the project works at their respective 
locations/sites expressed by their feedback and promises at the wrap up group discussion.  
2. Introducing each other  
At the beginning , Dejene Kassahun has introduced the contents of the training topics and the 
schedule for each topic for the two days and Yosef Gebrehawaryat has welcomed participants and 
invited each participant to introduce him/herself. Yosef Gebrehawaryat  has extended his 
welcoming by empha sizing on the importance the gathering of all relevant stakeholders to discuss 
on the implementation modalities of SI-MFS initiatives and to plan together for future activities. 
Afterward, each participant (Annex 1) introduced him/herself with emphasis on where he/she 
comes from and what is his/her responsibility in the area he/she came from. During the introduction 
session, participants were also requested to put forward their expectation from the training to allow 
the organizers shape the training content  according to the needs.

 Following the introduction, Dejene has briefly introduced what the A lliance of Bioversity 
international and CIAT does, CGIAR  and its vision, the new 2030 research and innovation strategy 
of the CG IAR, five  new impact areas of 203 0 research and innovation strategy  namely 1. Nutrition, 
health and food security; 2. Poverty reduction, livelihood and jobs; 3. Gender equality, youth and 
inclusion; 4. Climate adaptation and mitigation; and 5.  Environmental health and biodiversity   
(Annex II).   
3. The t rainings  
3.1. Sustainable Intensification of Mixed Farming System (SI -MFS)  
This briefing  was given by Dejene Kas sahun , member of the SI -MFS team . He has presented t o 
the participants the basic components of mixed farming  systems, the aim of SI -MFS initiate , global 
implementation perspectives of SI -MFS, national  implementation perspectives of SI -MFS, 
integration of CG centres by SI -MFS project, the holistic approach in SI -MFS research and the 
major components to consider in the approach (Annex III). At the end of this briefing  session, the 
following six questions  (in Amharic , the local language) were identified  for clarification in plenary  
group discussion . The questions were:   
1. Why did we  (farmers)  start application of c hemical inputs ( fertilizer s, herbicides, 
pesticides) ? What w ere the driving factor s? 
2. What shou ld we do to maintain the soil health and then sustain productivity?  
3. What should we do to provide balanced food/rich nutrition to our family?  
4. Do you think that c ommunity participation is necessary for agricultural sector 
improvement ? If yes, how can we do that?  
5. What is the experience of farmers in growing diversified crops/crop species on the given 
plot of land?  
6. Is agro biodiversity  increasing or decreasing  in you r area ? If it is decreasing, what is the 
cause and how can we improve  it? 
To enrich the points raised in each question, participants were assigned into groups, five groups 
formed, discussed each of the questions to their local context. The summary of group s reflections 
is presented below.  
Page 5:
3 
 Question 1. Why did we start applying chemical inputs ( fertilizer , herbicides, pesticides) ? 
What w ere the driving force s? 
Participants responses:  
• Gradual d eclin e in soil fertility and the need to increase crop production/yield  
• Difficult to prepare organic fertilizer/compost for all plots due to limited biomass 
availability  
• Labour shortage to prepare and distribute organic fertilizer s/compost  
• Reluctant working culture to prepare compost and distribute to all plots  
• The government push/policy to promote chemical fertilizer  
• The extension system more favours the use of chemical inputs over organic inputs  
• Intensification required due to land fragmentation  
• Government direction to feed the growing population  
• Tendency to look for short term benefits over the long -term effects  
• Use of crop residues as animal feed, caused continuous decline in soil fertility  
• Dominance of cereal monocropping without rotating with pulses due to occurrence pulse 
disease  
• Limited work s done to support organic farm input technologies (organic fertilizer, organic 
pest/herbicides)  
Question 2. What should we do to maintain the soil health and then sustain productivity?  
• Awareness creation on disadvantages and advantages  of chemical farm inputs  
• Production of organic farm inputs in quality and sufficient  quantity  
• Soil and water conservation through proven natural resource conservation practices  
• Use organic fertilizers  
• Practice crop rotation with pulses  
• Practice minimum tillage  
• Move towards sustainable crop production like crops -agroforestry  practices  
• Leave sufficient crop residues on the farm  
• Plough while the soil is wet to facilitate decomposition of green/organic matter and reduce 
soil erosion by wind  
• Practice under ploughing of green pulses for soil mulching  and fertility restoration  
Page 6:

 Question 3. What should we do to provide balanced food/rich nutrition to our family?  
• Apply integrated mixed farming systems including agro forestry  to have diversified 
products . 
• Need to change our culture/tradition of farmers such as ‘from farm to market’ to from ‘farm 
to home’ and allocate sufficient share of egg, milk, meat and variety of pulses and cereal 
grains for home consumption  to improve household nutrition.  
• Prod uce crop varieties and crop species that improve household food and nutritional 
security. Provide diversified and quality food to household members.   
• Thrive to produce and c onsume organic  products. It is possible!  
• Allocate homesteads for vegetables and fr uits production to complement household diet 
and nutrition.  
• Support household nutrition with animal protein such as milk, butter, egg and meat.  
• Raise awareness about balanced diet  
Question 4. Do you think that community participation is necessary for agr icultural sector 
improvement ? If necessary, how can we do that?  
Participants response:  
Yes, it is necessary for/to:  
o Efficient family labour mobilization for different farm operations (weeding, harvesting, 
keeping, threshing, transporting etc.)  
o Ensure gender sensitive participation in agricultural practices  
o Timely d emonstrat ion or t raining on  new agricultural technologies to uptake, upscale any 
good technologies/ practices  
o Train and increase awareness to revers existing bad practices (use of agro chemicals ) and 
promote good practices and technologies  
o Orientation of communities towards Integrate (system oriented) farm operation than 
commodity -based farm operations  
o Creation o f sustainable forum for e xperience sharing and community discussions.  
  
Page 7:
5 
 Question 5. What is the experience of farmers in growing diversified crops/crop species on 
the given plot of land?  
Participants responses:  
• The habit of growing different crop varieties or crop species on piece of farm has been 
decreasing, though i t differs with localities and farmers .  
• Participants have agreed that f armers  have been practicing monocropping of few crop 
varieties; th us, there is limited experience of crop diversifying  
o Some farmers, however, are growing diverse crops and crop species on the same 
plot of land in Hadiya.  
o There is experience of growing mixed cereals and pulses  or pulses with pulses ( e.g., 
Wasiera  = growing barley and wheat together ; Wajera  = growing mixture of faba 
bean and field pea together) in north Wollo.  
• Small landholding is mentioned as factor to discourage grow ing diversified crop 
varieti es/species   
Question 6. Is agro biodiversity increasing or decreasing in your area? If it is decreasing, 
what is the cause and how can we improve it?  
Biodiversity is declining; thus there is a need to: 
o Increasing awareness (especially of farmers for biodiversity is at their hand)  
o Practice agroforestry and promote forest restoration  
o Promote the plantation  of indigenous tree species  
o abandoning , if not, reducing agro -chemicals  
o Control industrial impacts, pollutions and land degradations  
o When chemical ap plication is necessary, apply safely and with due consideration of the 
biodiversity (insects, micro fauna in the soil, water and on the surface) and the right 
chemical to the right pest.  
o Re-introducing crop genetic resources of different important crop typ es.  
General discussion  
Page 8:
6 
 Following group reflection on the above questions, a general discussion was held so that 
participants explain their listed ideas. Consensus reached on the following points by the 
participants.  
1) Preparation of organic inputs is feasible in all areas as enough labour is available. 
Furthermore, availability of organic biomass could not be a series limiting factor  
2) Even though there is willing for rotation of cereals with pulses is a good solution for 
restoring soil fertility; but, d ue to disease and climate change impacts pulse production is 
declining exposing farming practice to cereal mono cropping.  
3) Participants unanimously agreed that most animal products and vegetables are channelled 
to markets without even considering household  demand. This has been greatly contributing 
household food and nutritional insecurity. Farmers sell these products to satisfy their 
financial demand. There is a need to maximize production to satisfy the market demand 
and family needs.   
3.2. Crowdsourcing approach  for sustainable intensification : concepts and implementation 
in Ethiopia  
This training was given by Mulugeta Tilahun. The concepts, principles and practices of 
crowdsourcing approach were presented in a way that participants understan d well. Success stor ies 
of applying crowdsourcing approach was focused to impress the participants  and arose their 
willing to adopt the approach. Contents of the training was presented in annex IV.  
At the end, participants  (trainee s) have embraced the concept of crowdsourcing and provided the 
following remarks for its successful implementation.   
• Recommend devising simple and easy ways of implementing it at the grassroot level 
without committing any mistakes. Also promised to be traini ng their colleagues what 
they have learned here.  
• To plan crowdsourcing trials in advance, in terms of time, to avoid any inconvenience 
in land allocation and timely seed distribution to crowd farmers.  
The team from the Alliance of Bioversity Internationa l and CIAT has agreed to provide adequate 
trainings at each district, prepare trial packages in good time and distribute to farmers and follow 
up with the trials for their successful implementation. Attending experts from the agricultural 
Page 9:

 sector also promi sed to assign technicians to imp lement the trials, follow up its implementation 
and to convivence farmers to allocate quality land for such trials. Participant farmers were also 
happy to participate in the trials as they understood well the benefit is thei rs.  
3.3. Exploring own genetic resources: the case of durum wheat in  Ethiopia  
This training was given by Yosef Gebrehawaryat. This training helped the participants to value 
the genetic resource at their hand rather that treating them as useless resources. The potential of 
farmers varieties of durum wheat for adaptation to climate change, improve farm production and 
productivity, and their potential as breeding materials was presented. The detail of the training was 
presented as annex V.  
Perception of the trainees:  
• The participatory approach of Bioversity International was much appreciated by the 
participants and consequently  participant farmers showed willingness to allocate their 
own land for trials managed by this institution.  
• Representative of the agriculture offices of each district showed their readiness to embed 
the approaches Bioversity international is using to their var iety’s evaluation, selection, 
multiplication and dissemination schemes by mobilizing farmers and their organizations.     
• The participants have requested Bioversity International to work towards policy influence 
to see policies that support farm diversific ation, use of indigenous crop genetic resources 
and organic farming.  
• The participants again requested Bioversity for continuous capacity building at local level 
so that the technologies and approaches recommended are simply up taken and upscaled.  
• Request ed to improve the value chain of important crops such as durum wheat, enset, faba 
bean to ensure farmers benefit from their production.  
4. Group discussion for major problems i dentif ication and intervention planning  
This time, participants from the same district were grouped together to discuss on the major 
problems their community is facing and suggest possible ways to tackling the prioritized 
problem/s. The identified problems to be considered in SI -MFS initiative o f each group is 
presented below.  
Page 10:
8 
 I. North Shewa: Bassona Worana district  
Mixed farming system is the major feature of Basona Worenda  district where wheat and faba 
bean are among the dominant crops grown. Their priority crops are wheat, especially durum 
wheat, and faba bean to address triple goals: improved productivity, improved nutrition,  and 
restored soil fertility.  
Major problems noticed by participants from Basona Wor ena district were: - 
• Lack of adaptable and improved varieties of many crops and hence dependence on 
few crops’  varieties . 
• Top – down approach of the extension system that undermine the participation of 
beneficiary farme rs in technology generation and dissemination . 
• Increased dependency on chemical inputs for agricultural production .  
• Low level of awareness on the importance of local crop varieties (landraces) at 
various levels including farmers.  
• High s taff turn -over which has been causing d iscontinuity of specific activities, 
missing  of data/records, failure to follow up .  
II. East Shewa: Gimbichu district  
Like north  Shewa, mixed farming system with the domination of wheat a nd beans char acterize this 
district . The particip ants from this district wanted to contin ue the upscaling of winner varieties of 
durum wheat and faba  bean , varieties identified through previous ABC pr ojects. The concern from 
Gimbich u district partici pants include:  - 
• Quantit y of provided breeder /pre-basic seeds : The amount of seeds given  to individual 
farmers is small and want t o multiply the seeds in organized manner to cover larger 
production area.  
• Climate change : The climatic condition of their area is becoming unpredictable  which 
has been exposing  crops to various biotic and abiotic st resses. Selection of crops for

• Low level of awareness on the importance of local crop varieties (landraces) and 
negative impact o f agrochemicals at various levels including farmers. The awareness 
on the impact of agro chemicals  is, however, gradually increasing.

 III. Hadiya  zone: Lemo district  
Subsistence traditional agricultur al farming system dominates the district's economy, with mixed 
farming s ystem p racticed by most  farmers. Enset (Enset ventricosum ), wheat, teff, barley, and 
maize are the most widely grown crops  in the area. Livestock is also an important component of 
the economy.  
Participant from Lemo district indicated that lack of adaptable varieties of enset  (to bacterial wilt), 
faba bean (to root rot disease) a nd wh eat for the prevailing  climatic conditions is the major 
production constraint  in their area . Pinpointed problems include:   
• Decrease of enset production du e to bacterial wilt disease  
• Climate  chan ge impact is very prominent and visi ble which is affect ing crop pr oduction 
in the  area 
• Low accessibility of the area for research and development works  
• Traditional way of doing farm business (untim ely operations of farm acti vities, 
suboptimal application of farm inputs etc ) 
• Low level of farmers’ awareness on superior indigenous varieties, plot allocation for 
testing and negative impa ct of agro -chemicals  
• Staff turn -over and discontinuity of tasks; missing of data/records, failure to follow up  
IV. North Wolo: Meket distric t 
Farming  system of Meket district is a combination of crop cultivation and livestock rearing.  Crops 
are mainly produced for home consumption, while most of the income for  household expenses is 
raised by selling  animals. Hence working towar d improving both the crop and livestock sectors 
will be sustainabl y improve the l ivelihoods of the small -scale  farmers. I n the highlands the main 
cereals are wheat, barley and teff, while sorghum and maize  predominate in the lowlands.  
Parti cipants  from the district have embraced  the works done by Bioversity  Internationa l in the ir 
district on durum wheat and faba  bean selection and dissemination and aspired to ensure such 
activities continuity  in thei r area. They have identified the following problems among the others:   
• Lack of systema tic coordination  between various actors for successful 
implementation of project activities  
Page 12:
10 
 • Lack of well-organized  local seed producing cooperatives for see d mu ltiplication 
and dissemination to farmers in need.  
• Lack of needed infrastructures such as seed stores to advance the local seed sector  
• Dwindling diversity of crops and lack of in -situ genetic resource s conservatio n 
centres  
With the notice on the problems mentioned by participants from each district, we believe that 
continu ed working on varieties evaluation , selection and dissemination /upscaling still be nefit the 
target communities a lot. In due cour se, we work with other cent res especiall y ILRI to address  the 
entire value cha in of the farming system by addressing the crop – livestock integration problems. 
Our crop commodities for th e SI-MFS initiative  works will be Enset and  Faba bean in Hadiya, 
durum wheat and faba  bean in the other zones of the target area.

Washington, DC: International Food Policy Research Institute Permanent link to cite or share this item https://hdl.handle.net/10568/125641 External link to download this item DOI Abstract/Description Female subsistence farmers in developing countries often have lower levels of agricultural productivity than men, partially due to lower adoption rates of agricultural technologies. These lower adoption rates may be due to lack of physical access to new technologies or lack of access to information about new technologies, among other explanations. In this study, we consider these two classes of explanations of low technology use among females, and test the relative impacts of interventions designed to combat each. Specifically, we consider adoption of a climate-resistant, early maturing cassava variety by female farmers. Using a randomized control trial with a 2x2 matrix treatment design, we plan to test the effects on cassava adoption by female farmers of two interventions: delivering cassava seeds to female farmers at their homes (improved access), and hiring female ""lead farmers,"" to diffuse information about cassava seeds (improved information access). Results from a small pilot in 6 villages suggest that 1) male lead farmers are less likely than female lead farmers to train female household members during a household visit (despite all lead farmers being explicitly instructed to train females), and 2) female farmers almost unanimously prefer receiving training from a female lead farmer. Pilot results also provide insights on ways that the treatments can be improved, such as lead farmers providing follow-up training visits. These preliminary findings support the viability and importance of employing female trainers in teaching female farmers about new agricultural technologies.

Motivation
▪Women often have lower rates of adoption of profitable agricultural 
technologies (Ali et al. 2016, Fisher and Kandiwa 2014)
▪Many reasons why this might be the case:
oLack of physical access to inputs
oTransportation constraints, childcare burden, household bargaining 
issues (Udry 1996, Quisumbing and Pandolfelli 2010).
oLack of access to extension services
oCultural norms that inhibit communication between male extension 
agents and female farmers (Ragasa et al. 2013)
▪Possibility that multiple constraints bind as well
Page 3:
Research Question
▪How do interventions designed to alleviate gender -specific input access 
constraints affect adoption of a new agricultural technology? Are there 
important complementarities between treatments?
▪Consider 2 intervention components:
oSeed Access: Delivery of seeds directly to female household members 
at their homes
oExtension Access: Receiving an extension visit from a female peer 
farmer 
▪Plan to answer this question using a randomized control trial with a 2x2 
factorial design
T1: Control T1: Seed Access
T2: Control Control Seed Only
T2: Extension Access Extension Only Both
Page 4:
Context
▪Location: Murang’a County, Kenya
oMostly grow maize
▪Technology: drought -tolerant, early 
maturing cassava variety
oImportant climate change 
adaptation strategy
▪Partners:
oFocusWise (Focus on Cassava): 
Local community organization
oKALRO (Kenya Agriculture and 
Livestock Research Institute)
Page 5:
Intervention Strategy
▪Lead Farmer implementation model
▪Community elects 2 lead farmers (in some communities, post reserved for woman)
▪Lead farmers are trained by FocusWise /KALRO in cassava production techniques
▪Lead farmers then deliver treatment(s) to female farmers in the community: 
extension visit and/or seed access
▪Extension model is similar to KALRO’s current cassava promotion programs (minus 
the gender reservations for female lead farmers)
oMore scalable than traditional extension models
Page 6:
Pilot
▪Implemented interventions in 6 villages in March -
April 2022
▪2 lead farmers, 20 farmers to be treated in each 
village
▪Follow up survey in April 2022
▪Training provided by FocusWise
▪Goals:
oAssess relevance (Are these interventions 
context -appropriate?
oAssess feasibility (e.g. Will community feel 
comfortable electing lead farmers?)
oA/B Testing of design details
Page 7:
Key Findings: Interventions are relevant!
▪Female -managed plots were significantly less likely to be using 
improved seed varieties (both in male and female headed households)
▪Male lead farmers were significantly less likely to talk to female 
farmer at household extension visit : 54% of time by male lead farmers 
vs. 95% of time by female lead farmers)
▪95% of female lead farmers say they prefer to receive extension from 
a female lead farmer (rest indifferent)
▪Households were very interested in learning about and growing 
cassava !
Page 8:
Interventions are feasible
▪Communities did not have an issue electing 
female lead farmers and in practice ¾ of 
elected lead farmers were female (required at 
least 1 vote for a female in all pilot villages)
▪Community members perceived both male and 
female lead farmers as knowledgeable (as 
opposed to other evidence from Malawi in 
Benyishay et al. 2020)
▪Lead farmers delivered trainings and seeds in 
practice, and generally followed experimenter 
directions
Page 9:
Some key refinements
▪Potentially important to vote by secret ballot 
▪Have a central seed distribution day for farmers that are not in the 
“seed access” treatment rather than having to go pick them up at a 
lead farmer’s house.
▪Require trainings to be done at a household visit (not at lead 
farmer’s home)
▪More written resources and opportunities for lead farmers to follow -
up with trainers
Page 10:
Conclusion and Next Steps
▪Pilot very useful in affirming need and feasibility of treatments and 
providing some important learnings to refine treatments
▪Plan to now (hopefully) scale up to a full RCT
▪Supplemental question of interest: Is cassava a “woman’s crop?”
oConceptions that men grow high value crops and women grow 
garden crops/low -value, new varieties are drought -tolerant, early 
maturing, etc.
oWillingness -to-pay exercises with male and female farmers at 
baseline about willingness to pay for improved cassava cuttings

Highlights of Evidence Summary
Climate smart food systems transformation and gender equality are mutually reinforcing. 
Climate Smart Villages (CSVs) in India resulted in enhanced knowledge and capacities of women farmers and promotion of gender equality in households.  
Need for multi-sector, multi-agency coordination within the region to exchange learnings and best practices. 
Further research needed especially to address structural inequalities and gaps in capacities for gender-responsive policymaking and practices. Gender budgeting is key. 
GTA not well represented in the literature or evidence. Important to differentiate between gender transformation, gender equity and gender equality outcomes. 
Need for better knowledge about inter- and intra-gender differences in needs, priorities, constraints, and outcomes related to creating intersectional climate smart policies and practice.
Further research needed to understand the impact of collective action and social networks as effective mechanisms for women’s empowerment and gender equality under a changing climate.

 1.0 Introduction  
Aquatic foods are an important and growing component of the global food system and contribute 
towards all the five CGIAR impact a reas  which are i) Nutrition, health and food security ; ii) Poverty 
reduction, livelihoods and jobs ; iii) Gender equality, youth  and inclusion ; iv) Climate adaptation and 
mitigation  and v) Environmental health and biodiversity . However, the potential benefits are 
threatened by multiple stressors such as:  
 Overharvesting of wild aquatic food stocks and poor governance of aquatic 
comm ons;  
 Inequities in supply -chains, including from competing demands for aquatic foods in 
globalized markets;  
 Vulnerabilities of coastal and riparian communities and aquatic ecosystems to 
climate change;  
 Degradation and destabilization of aquatic ecosyste m productivity, biodiversity and 
carbon -sequestering functions arising from pollution, land use change, and 
competition for water, space and resources;  
 Aquatic animal diseases that destabilize production - and antimicrobial resistance;  
 Supply chains inef ficiencies and disruptions from COVID -19, natural hazards and 
political and economic instabilities; and   
 Underinvestment  in breeding aquatic animals for improved growth, feed conversion 
efficiency and climate resilience.  
Investing in effective aquatic fo od system (AqFS) governance, informed by research, can address 
these threats by eliminating the key systemic challenges facing the sector, offering transition 
pathways to a more just, nutritious, healthier, lower -carbon, and climate -resilient food system. 
From 30 years of CGIAR work on AqFS and extensive review and consultation, five systemic 
challenges that must be tackled to build the resilience of AqFS and realize their full potentials in 
delivering a triple win for nature, people and climate. The challe nges have been categories into five 
work packages.  While the RAqFS Initiative will work across multiple geographies, Zambia will 
benefit from three of the five work packages under the initiative. The overall goal of the work 
packages is to contribute to t he creation of systemic change that will build the resilience of aquatic 
food systems and deliver a triple win for nature, people and the economy. The transformation of 
aquatic food systems requires reliable, fair, integrated, evidence -based and actionable  insights to 
guide demand, innovation, and scaling partners to coordinate and catalyze change. By integrating 
data sources and data generation within new data ecosystems based on co -development processes 
in the target contexts, WP1 will support investments  and inform decisions and policy actions toward 
socially inclusive aquatic food systems transformation. The three work packages bei ng implemented 
in Zambia are as tabulat ed in Table1 below : 
 
 
 
Page 5:

 Table 1: CGIAR impact areas  
Work Package  Goal  
WP1: Aqua 
Data  To promote evidence -based AqFS decision -making to transform aquatic food 
systems through actionable insights on demand, innovation, and scaling of 
technologies in a coordinated manner. WP1 will help Zambia support 
investments a nd inform decisions and policy actions toward socially inclusive 
aquatic food systems transformation  
WP3: Aqua 
Plans  To strengthen inclusion of AqFS in cross -sectoral land -water -foodscape 
planning. The WP3 will be implemented on the Kafue flats and it is expected 
to help government and other stakeholders respond to the vulnerability of 
water and land foodscapes and landscape integrity to multiple stressors by 
assessing those risks and vulnerabilities and by elaborating participative 
development scenarios  
WP5: Aqua 
Labs  To stimulate creation of national innovation platforms (comprising multi -
stakeholders) for aquatic food systems that will scale proven innovations and 
accelerate co -creation of future innovations. WP5 will foster peer -to-peer 
learning and st imulate local innovations through partnerships, including public 
private partnerships to develop, pilot and scale new technologies and 
institutional innovations. The innovations will include but not be limited to ; 
development of novel aqua feeds, culture o f new species, value -addition and 
waste -reduction technologies, social movements to revive nutritious 
traditional diets, and pro -poor and marginalized group empowerment 
technologies. The Aqua Labs, which will be gender -sensitive and youth 
inclusive, will a lso help to embed CGIAR research in national research and 
market systems and shift the locus of innovation closer to target AqFS actors. 
The Aqua Labs aim to build on the work of the other work packages  
 
The stakeholder engagement workshop was convened  to introduce the RAqFS initiative (in 
particular the Aqua Plans work package) to the traditional leaders, community representatives and 
stakeholders working within the Kafue flats. Participants were drawn from Royal Highnesses from 
seven chiefdoms of the Kafue flats, Community r esource Board representatives, d evelopment 
agencies, extension officers from government line ministries, NGOs and the academia (refer to 
Appendix2 for the Attendance Record).

 2.0 Workshop Proceedings  
2.1. Session1: Official o pening  
2.1.1  Welcoming  remark s: Country Director – World Fish  
Dr. Victor Siamudaala opened the workshop by welcoming all delegates present. He sincerely 
thanked them all for setting aside time to 
attend the workshop. He  encouraged all 
participants to freely contribute to the 
workshop proceedings; so that there could be 
sharing and learning from one another; 
regarding conservation and governance i ssues 
on the Kafue flats. He echoed that the CGIAR 
(in particular  WP3 was keen  to work with the 
stakeholders on the ground in finding solutions 
for sustainable governance of the natural 
resources of the Kafue flats. He reiterated that 
the aim of WP3 was to  have a sustainable land 
and water resource governance of the Kafue flats; by e ngaging all key stakeholders. H e stressed the 
importance of aquaculture and the Kafue flats which is the habitat of fish, birds and many other 
animals. Dr. Siamudaala ended his remarks with the following statement: “ We wish to engage you 
our traditional leaders in shaping this initiative so that you can help us come up with solutions to the 
main challenges we are facing in managing our resources. This is why we are here today ”. 
 
2.1.2  Introductions  
The Moderator then led the participants into self -introductions where they each said the name and 
the organization/institution that they represented. Further, the participant had to state at least one 
of their expectations from th e wor kshop.  
2.1.3  Opening Remarks by His Royal Highness ( HRH ) Chief Nalubamba; Chairperson of the 
Southern Province Chiefs Council  
Chief Nalubamba began  by acknowledging the presence 
of his fellow chiefs.  He then  thanked the organizers of 
the workshop for convening the various stakeholders to 
discuss important matters regarding natural resources 
management in the Kafue flats.  Chief Nalubamba 
echoed the v alue of having stakeholders develop strong 
partnerships with the traditional leadership in the 
chiefdoms were they were operating  in. The Chief 
emphasized that by working closely with the traditional 
leaders and local communities, project implementers woul d gain indigenous knowledge that would

 2.1.4  Presentation - The role of Traditional Leaders in land and water resources management of 
the Kafue Flats: HRH Chief Choongo  
HRH Chief Choongo began  by mentioning that 
traditional rulers are a key unit in the 
management of natural resources, in their 
respective  chiefdom s. The Chief went on to 
reveal that as custodians of the land, traditional 
leaders have a great role to play in land and 
water resource s management. He directly 
translated this cardinal role in local language as, 
“Bami babulongo *”. HRH Chief Choongo further 
on emphasized that Traditional leaders are the 
ones that allocate land to the people and chiefs 
preside over  all land related dispute s. Chiefs also  preside over the waters and hence have control 
over some fishing areas. HRH ended his presentation by mentioning that as custodians of the land  
and the related water resources, traditional leaders have powers to reprimand any one who violates  
the laws and regulations regarding natural resource harvesting and utilization.  
*”Rulers of the soil ” 
2.1.5  Objectives of the workshop presented by Dr  Everisto Mapedza, Leader of the AquaPlans  
Dr Mapedza began  by highlighting that the RAqFS  Initiative was officially launched on  12th July 2022 
at the Grand  Palace Hotel in 
Lusaka. He echoed that the 
stakeholder engagement 
workshop was convened to get 
endorsement and ownership 
among st the chiefs, communities 
and the various stakeholders  
within the Kafue flats. In 
particular, he stated that since 
the WP3 was going to be 
implemented in the Kafue flats; 
One CGIAR decided to hold the 
worksho p in order to seek 
implementation guidance from 
the stakeholders who are going to be involved in the initiative. Additionally, Dr. Mapedza explained 
that the workshop aimed at ensuring sustainability of the proposed RAqFS initiative. Sustainability 
will be  attained through local ownership and direction from the key stakeholders so that local, 
national and regional priorities and policies would be incorporated during implementation process. 
He added that the workshop was an opportunity for people working on the project to listen and be 
informed on how best the multi stakeholder dialogue would be co-designed and jointly 
implemented . Dr. Mapedza listed the specific objectives of the workshop as follows:  
 Courtesy call to the royal highnesses and key stakeholders ;

trade, securing habit ats and connectivity in development planning and apply research and 
monitori ng. He ended his presentation by highlighting the o opportunities for partnership in 
Kafue Landscape, which included:  
 Improvement of sustainable fisheries management and livelihoods through supporting 
feasibility and piloting of a sustainable fisheries mana gement in the form of blended 
finance.

  Implementation of the “One Kafue Restoration Plan” which combines the conservation 
and restoration of wildlife and freshwater in the Kafue river basin.  
 Building the Kafue Rowing Centre  with the objective to use the sport of rowing to 
educate and raise awareness of the importance of aquatic environments.  
 Amplifying the voices of communities , facilitators and advocates of innovative and 
inclusive climate solutions i.e. inclusive participation, promotion of nature -based  
solutions and climate financing.  
 Replication conservation agriculture and bee keeping  in a quest to increase food and 
income security and conservation of forests.  
 Mitigation of human -wildlife conflicts through supporting community households with 
training  in human -wildlife conflict management strategies.  
Question : After the presentation, one participant posed a question to Mr. Syamuntu as follows, “Did 
you form these communities or integrated yourself into the already existing communities”?  
 
Response : “We are using the already existing  communities and the principle of inclusion is what we 
are using. Whatever we are doing is going through the traditional system, even if we want to put up 
a water system it has to go through the traditional leadership system”.  
 
2.2.2  Solidaridad  activities  presented  by Mr . Conor  Dolan  
Mr. Conor stated by stating that Solidaridad is promoting governance of natural resources of the 
Kafue flats. He highlighted some of the activities being implemented  in collaboration with 
government agencies and other stakeholders. The activities included:   
 Kafue Fisheries governance in 
Shimungalu area (in collaboration with 
WWF)   
 Nachipoma aquaculture promotion 
(collaboration with Essential 
Commodities ) 
 Kachasu brew ers survey  
 Lower Kaleya water quality MSc survey 
(Environmental Health Unit of the 
Ministry of Health)  
 Wastewater treatment solution  
 Kaleya water ab straction study (with Water Resources Management Authority – WARMA)  
 Small and large Water User Association ( WUA ) engagement (with WARMA)  
 
2.2.3  International  Crane Foundation  activities p resented  by Mr. Mwape Sichilongo    
 
Mr. Sichilongo  introduced the presentation by stating that partnership were critical in the success of 
protecting and conserving natural resources. He echoed that protecting and conserving the Kafue 
flats is of local, national, regional and global interest because it pr ovides a number of benefits which

 include grazing, livelihood, fishing, tourism and habitats for wildlife (more so for migrating birds). 
He gave future directions as, identifying, recognizing, and empowering the custodians of nature in 
Africa he added that  mechanisms to address past and ongoing injustices in c onservation people are 
the center of  conservation.  
For effective conservation results, M r. Sichilongo stressed that there is need for an integrated 
approach by all stakeholders. He emphasized that integrated stakeholder management approaches 
would be helpful given the financial and 
human resource challenges faced by the 
different interest gro ups. Synergies would 
result in maximized  utilization of the limited 
resources. He further recommended 
introduction of performance -based 
incentives, identification of more partnerships 
for sustainability, increased fundraising, 
improving transport and accom modation and 
engaging traditional leaders on different 
platforms. Mr. Sichilongo ended his 
presentation by reciting quotes that were 
echoed earlier in the day by the Royal 
Highnesses Chieftainess Muwezwa, Chief Choongo and Chief Hamusonde:  
“Nature loves u s and so we should love it too” HRH Chieftainess Muwezwa . 
“We belong to the same clan as the Nanja and Kala” HRH Chief Choongo . 
“By removing Mimosa pigra with the youth and creating seasonal income, you are helping us to 
solve many other social problems” H RH Chief Hamusonde . 
 
2.2.4 Bird Watch Zambia  activities presented  by Mr. Swithin Kashulwe  
Mr. Kashulwe started by mentioning that Bird Watch Zambia  (BWZ)  is a partner to Bird Life 
International which is the world’s largest nature conservation organization.  He listed the work 
conducted  by BWZ ; particularly in the Kafue Flats to include: species monitoring, habitat monitoring, 
and environmental education an d community awareness. He elaborated that species monitoring 
involves biannual water bird counting, vulture surveys, and bat surveys. He further added that 
habitat monitoring contribute to the environmental status report which is compiled by WWF. He 
shared  that the environmental education and community awareness exercise has so far reached out 
to over 500 learners and 700 community members have been. In ending his presentation, Mr. 
Kashulwe emphasized that indigenous knowledge was essential in achieving sus tainable natural 
resources management.  
2.2.5  Copperbelt University (CBU)  activities presented by Dr. George Kampamba  
Dr. George Kampamba presented on “Integrated research and monitoring of water quality and 
quantity, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems of the Kafue river catchment” Project that CBU is 
conducting in the Kafue River catchment.

 The presentation comprised of the project 
overview, study area, project aim, clusters, and 
achievements so far.  He informed the 
participants that the project aim was to 
contribute to securing the future of the Kafue 
river catchment, through research -derived 
solutions. He further made mention that the 
project was split into 12 clusters for fundraising 
and implementation. “These clusters have been 
developed by experts from different schools and 
departments within the Copperbelt University”, 
echoed Dr. Kampamba. He presented the 12 clusters as: cluster -1 (mapping and model ing); cluster -
2 (water quality: Heavy metals & pesticides); cluster -3 (water quality: accumulation of 
radionuclides); cluster -4 (water contamination and biodiversity); cluster -5 (water quantity:  surface 
and ground water); cluster -6 (climate change and ada ptation); cluster -7 (resource management), 
climate change & conflict; cluster -8 (eco -tourism and human activities); cluster -9 (gender and 
climate change); cluster -10 (water governance); cluster -11 (improved forest resources management 
at river sources); an d cluster -12 (project coordination).  
 
2.2.6  Presentation on the  role of Gender in  Natural Resources  Management:  a case of the  
Muwezwa Chiefdom , presented by HRH  Chieftainess Muwezwa   
Her Royal Highness Chieftainess Muwezwa shared that her Chiefdom has drafted gender guidelines 
in a quest to enhance management of natural resources. The gender guidelines were developed by 
the Sub -committee of the House of Chiefs w ith the support of the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID) 
Integrated Land and Resource 
Governance Program. The guidelines 
were launched by the Minister of Local 
Government and Rural Development 
(Hon. Garry Nkombo); in collaboration 
with Chalimbana University. Her Royal 
Highness stressed that the main purpose 
for the guidelines was to review and 
repeal cultural norms that negatively 
impact o n women’s rights. She went on 
to state that the guidelines address (but 
are not limited to) the  following thematic areas:  education; land; agriculture; forestry; climate 
change; wildlife; fisheries; water and; early child marriages. The Chieftainess echoed that the 
guidelines were developed in alignment with chiefdom policies and in alignment with  governance 
structures, social -cultural issues, women and vulnerable persons’ empowerment, human rights, 
gender based violence and knowledge management. To ensure actualization of the guidelines, 
Action Plans were also developed. Action Plans were constitut ed by local communities, traditional

 leaders; with support of the International Crane Foundation (ICF), Community Markets for 
Conservation (COMACO); with technical guidance from the USAID  Integrated Land and Resources 
Governance  (ILRG ) Programme . Her Royal Highness appealed to support in implementing the Action 
Plan. She stated that there was need for a lot of capacity building and sensitization if the Gender 
Guidelines are to be actualized; to result in effective natural resource management. How ever, she 
bemoaned the lack  of resources and appealed to all stakeholders present to get on board and render 
support to ensure the Gender Guidelines are implemented in all chiefdoms of the Kafue Flats. The 
support required would be in form of transport, tr aining materials and any other logistical support. 
Her Royal Highness ended with the quote “ We cannot survive without nature, so we must love 
nature for nature to love us ”. 
 
2.3 Session3:  Conservation  challenges and  opportunities in the  Kafue Flats   
 
To brains torm on  the challenges and opportunities, the team was divided into three working groups. 
The groups were broken down as follows: Group  1 – Royal Highnesses; Group  2 – Development 
partners and NGOs; Group3 – community representatives and government represe ntatives. After 
brainstorming, the groups presented feedback as summarized below:  
 
Group 1:  Royal Highnesses  
This group was tasked to identify livelihoods present in the Kafue Flats, conservation challenges and 
proposed solutions. Feedback is presented in Table2 below.  
 
Table 2: Feedback from Group1 -Group work  
Livelihoods present in the 
Kafue Flats  
 Conservation challenges 
faced by communities  
 Proposed solutions  
 
 Wildlife hunting 
(legal/licensed)  
 Livestock rearing  
 Agriculture and 
horticulture  
 Fishing  
  Over fishing and use of 
wrong fishing gear 
which results in poor 
fish harvest  
 Partners working in 
isolation which can 
lead to duplication of 
efforts and inefficiency 
as regards resource 
utilization  
 Lack of feedback from 
research that  is 
undertaken by the 
research institutions  We do not support the idea 
of people taking the 
anima ls in the floodplain 
and stay for good.  
 There is need to have 
sustainable fishing method s 
 Deforestation of valuable 
trees should not be allowed  
 NGOs should collaborate 
with government 
departments such as 
fisheries, forestry etc.  
 Whenever NGOs want to 
come and do any work in 
the Kafue flats, they should 
Page 13:
  
12 
 
 and any other 
organizations  
 Early and uncontrolled 
bush fires which are a 
threat to both humans 
and wildlife, domestic 
animals and the 
environment in general  
 engage the headmen/ 
subjects.  
 
 
 
Group2: Development  partners and NGOs  
This group was given  structured questions to inform the discussion . Feed back to the discussions is 
as captured in T able3  below.  
 
Table 3: Feedback from Group2Group work  
Do NGOs have influence on 
decision making on aquatic 
food systems?  Do you have interest in 
managing aquatic foods?  Challenges  
 
 Most NGOs do not have 
influence on making 
decision regarding 
aquatic foods; this 
privilege lies mainly 
with government  Yes, because they are 
source of food, 
nutrition, food for birds 
and a source of 
employment.  
  Structures are not in 
good condition and 
have become dormant

 agencies and ultimately 
the respective 
communities  
 
 NGOs take advantage 
of the current 
government policies 
(including community 
by-laws) in order to 
voice their concerns and 
suggestions  
  Sustainable resource 
management will 
culminate into mor e 
food and incomes for 
local communities and 
the nation at large. 
More food and incomes 
will imply improved 
nutrition, health and 
wellbeing

Group 3: Community representatives and government representatives  
What would you propose as solutions to illegal  fishing practices  
 Sensitizing  c ommunities on the 
negative effects of such 
practices  
 Developing strong by -laws that 
will punish would -be offenders  
 Engage Communities at every 
level of decision making that 
regards resource management  
 During fishing ban all settlers to 
move away from breeding 
areas  
 Alternative  livelihoods (such as 
fish farming, goat keeping, poultry, bee -keeping etc); to reduce the urge to fish at all costs 
(including use of illegal methods and also during fishing ban)  
 
2.4. Major  Workshop Outcomes  
 Clear endorsement  and buy in for the WP3 propo sed activities by Chiefs and other key 
stakeholders  
 A good overview  
 Synergies  need to be built with other ongoing activities  
 Quick wins  interventions are needed  – specifically aquaculture interventions targeted at 
some of the chiefs homesteads as demonstration sites.  
 Communication of research findings  is central for building trust in the study communities.  
 Technical assistance with the guidelines was made to the research team . 
 Challenges, opportunities and solutions within the Kafue Flats were identified.  
 
2.5 Closing remarks  
Chieftainess Muwezwa closed the workshop by thanking WorldFish and International Water 
Management Institute (IWMI) for organizing the timely  workshop where different stakeholders 
came together to deliberate on challenges, opportunities and possible solutions to conservation 
issues in the Kafue Flats.  She also thanked the other Royal Highnesses present for having made time 
out of their busy sc hedules to attend the workshop. Chieftainess Muwezwa went further to 
acknowledge all stakeholders present; a nd made a plea for all to be pro -active to ensure that 
workshop resolutions are effected. She ended by assuring the participants of the royal highne sses 
commitment to the RAqFS initiative.

31. Introduction
1.1. Background and context
Aquatic foods are an essential and growing 
component of the global food system and 
provide various benefits; however, these benefits 
are threatened by multiple stressors such as 
overharvesting of wild aquatic food stocks and poor 
governance of aquatic commons. These shocks 
lead to the marginalization of traditional indigenous 
fishers, inequalities in supply chains resulting from 
competing demands for aquatic foods in globalized 
markets (Farmery et al. 2021), vulnerabilities of 
coastal and riparian communities and aquatic 
ecosystems to climate change (Tigchelaar et al. 
2021), degradation and destabilization of aquatic 
ecosystem productivity, biodiversity and carbon-
sequestration functions arising from pollution, 
land-use change, and competition for water, 
space and resources (Vörösmarty et al. 2010; 
Cohen et al. 2019). Other stressors include aquatic 
animal diseases that can destabilize production 
and antimicrobial resistance (Cabello et al. 2013), 
supply chains inefficiencies (McMahon, 2022) 
and disruptions from COVID-19 (Farrell et al. 
2020), natural hazards and political and economic 
instabilities (Gephart et al. 2017; Sievert et al. 2019) 
and underinvestment in breeding aquatic animals 
for improved growth, feed conversion efficiency and 
climate resilience (Lala-Pritchard and Johnstone, 
2020; Benzie, Beveridge and Marwaha 2021). 
Rapid population growth, urbanization, and 
increasing incomes are expected to lead to a 
higher demand for fish and high-value foods, 
triggering higher fish imports (Ragasa et al. 2022). 
If aquaculture does not rapidly expand, the 
supply-demand gap will widen, and per capita, 
fish consumption will drop if imports cannot fill 
the gap (Chan et al. 2019). Under a business-as-
usual scenario modelling, African aquaculture 
production will likely be 2.8 million metric tons in 
2050; however, it needs to grow by an additional 
5.0 million metric tons by 2030 and 10.6 million 
metric tons by 2050 to reduce dependence on 
imports—two and four times higher than current 
rates, respectively (Chan et al. 2019). Invigorating 
local production and accelerated aquaculture 
growth could generate 8 million jobs along the 
value chains in Africa. (Chan et al. 2021).European counties have the highest aquatic food 
consumption in the world, with Portugal recording 
over 36kg per capita; however, African populations 
consume less with a per capita average of 10kg 
(Neethling 2022). Aquatic food accounts for 
60% of Ghana’s national dietary intake of animal 
protein (Rurangwa et al. 2015; Chan et al. 2021), 
about four times higher than the global average 
(Hishamunda et al. 2009). Ghana is an exception 
in the continent. The current gap between 
aquatic food demand and supply, which is filled 
by imports, is about 60% (600,000 tons) of total 
fish production (Ragasa et al. 2022). Expansion in 
aquatic food demand, because of rapid population 
growth, urbanization, increasing incomes, and 
changing consumer preferences, is expected to 
continue, and therefore, the supply-demand gap 
is forecast to widen by 2050 since only marginal 
increases in fish production can be expected from 
improved capture fisheries management (Chan et 
al. 2021). Therefore, Ghana presents an appropriate 
context for implementing the Consultative 
Group on International Agricultural Research 
(CGIAR) Aquatic Food Systems Initiative (AqFS). 
The AqFS aims to strengthen the resilience of 
aquatic food systems to realize their full potential 
for nature, people and climate by tackling systemic 
challenges such as data gaps, gendered power 
asymmetries, water resource mismanagement, 
limited research investment and missed 
opportunities for scaling through agricultural 
innovation systems and address food insecurity 
by piloting the co-designing and scaling of 
aquaculture interventions in small water reservoirs 
for multiple-use purposes (irrigation, aquaculture, 
livestock, and domestic uses). World Fish and the 
International Water Management Institute (IWMI) 
are co-leading the implementation of this new 
initiative in 11 countries in the six target regions 
of Central West Asia and North Africa (CWANA), 
Southern Asia (SA), West and Central Africa (WCA), 
Southeast Asia and the Pacific (SEAandP), Eastern 
and Southern Africa (ESA), and Latin America and 
the Caribbean (LAandC). The beneficiary countries 
are Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, India, Kenya, 
Malawi, Myanmar, Nigeria, Solomon Islands, Timor 
Leste and Zambia.

4The three-year project is being implemented 
through global and regional programs categorized 
into five major work packages: Work Package 
1 AquaData – focused on data and analytical 
tools supporting Aquatic Food Systems Initiative 
(AqFS) policies and investments in aquatic 
food systems; Work Package 2 Aqua+Partners – 
focused on creating cross-system partnerships 
to support AqFS actors’ inclusion in food system 
transformations and ocean economy; Work 
Package 3 – including AqFS in multi-functional 
water management plan; Work Package 4 
AquaGenetics – focused on public-private 
partnerships to scale delivery of genetically-
improved fish varieties; and Work Package 5 
AquaLabs – focused on creating platforms to 
evaluate, scale and accelerate the uptake of 
existing AqFS innovations. 
The Resilient Aquatic Food Systems Initiative 
will work across multiple geographic locations; 
however, Work Package 3 (AquaPlans) is 
specifically targeting Ghana and will look to 
implement the most effective pathways to scale 
nutritionally sensitive integrated AqFS as well as 
how socially inclusive technologies and practices 
for aquatic foods can be incorporated into water 
resources projects and plans. Together with users, 
implementers and scalers, the initiative will co-
design integrated packages and investments to 
upscale and apply a suite of multifunctional water 
and landscape innovations. These will result in 
more inclusive, diverse, resilient and sustainable 
aquatic food production systems.
Work Package 1 (Aqua Data) will also be 
implemented in Ghana to strengthen data-driven 
decision-making by examining the data gaps at 
different scales needed to be filled to understand 
and transform AqFS and the social, economic 
and environmental benefits and trade-offs of 
production and consumption of sustainable 
aquatic foods in a changing climate. 
Partner institutions for the implementation in 
Ghana include the Ministry of Fisheries and 
Aquaculture Development, Ministry of Food and 
Agriculture, Council for Scientific and Industrial 
Research Water Research Institute (CSIR-WRI), 
Fisheries Commission and the Ghana Irrigation 
Development Authority (GIDA).1.2. Problem statement 
Fisheries and aquaculture play a significant role 
in food and financial security (Béné and Heck, 
2005; Béné et al. 2015; Akongyuure et al. 2017; 
Akongyuure, Amisah and Edziyie 2017); however, 
there is limited empirical evidence of aquaculture 
significantly affecting poverty directly or indirectly 
(Toufique and Belton, 2014). In Ghana, capture 
fisheries and aquaculture do not meet 50% of 
the fish demand (Obirikorang et al. 2015). The 
challenges to the development of aquaculture 
identified for sub-Saharan Africa are feed and 
seed quality and availability, cost of cage and 
pond construction, financing and lack of technical 
acumen (Ridler and Hishamunda, 2001; Halwart 
and Moehl, 2006; Moehl et al. 2006; Blow and 
Leonard, 2007; Asmah, 2008), and lack of a market 
(Halwart and Moehl, 2006; Moehl et al. 2006). A 
lack of funds, high cost of feed, theft and lack of 
extension services have also been identified as 
constraints (Anane-Taabeah et al. 2011). 
The co-design process will be informed through 
the synthesis of existing literature on aquaculture 
and initial site selection will be informed by 
remote sensing reservoir and suitability mapping 
exercises. The other key criteria for site selection 
will include water quantity and seasonality, water 
quality, socioeconomics (nutrition, poverty, 
Gender Equality and Social Inclusion [GESI]), 
ecosystems, and climate change vulnerability to 
contribute toward the attainment of Sustainable 
Development Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero 
hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 5 (gender 
equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 13 
(climate action) and 14 (life below water).
1.3. Aim and specific objectives of the 
workshop
The aim of the CGIAR Initiative on Aquatic 
Foods workshop was to bring together relevant 
stakeholders to collaborate and brainstorm on 
how to leave a positive footprint in ensuring 
an abundance of aquatic foods to meet rising 
population growth, rising demand for aquatic 
foods, reduce poverty, improve environmental 
and climate performance and sustain nutrition 
and food diversity, whilst improving resilience 
and aquatic agricultural production systems. The 
specific objectives of the workshop were: 
Page 9:
5• To introduce the CGIAR Initiative on Aquatic 
Foods to key stakeholders and partners. 
• To start the process of engagement 
with partners in the co-design of priority 
research activities to inform and support the 
development of a sustainable, equitable and 
healthy aquatic foods sector. 
The workshop formally started with introductory 
remarks and welcome statements by Dr Everisto 
Mapedza/IWMI and Dr Olufunke Cofie/IWMI. 
Solidarity statements were delivered by Dr Anthony 
Yaw Karikari (Deputy Director CSIR, Water Research Institute) on behalf of the Director of the Institute 
Prof. Yaw Osei Atweneboana, Paul Bannerman 
(Deputy Executive Director, Fisheries Commission), 
Eric Samuel Adu Danquah (Director of Planning, 
Monitoring, Evaluation and Coordination of 
Ghana Irrigation Authority) on behalf of the Chief 
Executive Engineer, Wilson Darkwah. Presentations/

62.1. Excerpts of introductory remarks by 
facilitator, Dr Everisto Mapedza of IWMI
Everisto Mapedza, of the project implementing 
team, appealed to presenters to work within 
schedule (Annex 1) and participants should listen 
attentively to get the meaning behind the words 
that people will voice during the roundtable 
brainstorming session. Participants should wrestle 
with ideas, not persons. Although people can 
see things from different perspectives, a healthy 
dialogue is indispensable for success. 
2.2. Welcome statement by IWMI country 
representative Dr Olufunke Cofie
IWMI is part of the CGIAR system organization–a 
global research partnership for food, secured 
future dedicated to reducing poverty, enhancing 
food and nutritional security and improving 
natural resources management. IWMI’s role 
in this global partnership is to provide water 
solutions for sustainable climate-resilient 
development through clearly defined research 
for development actions. We are a research 
institute and not a conventional academic entity, 
but we bring scientific expertise to bear on 
development challenges. We bring solutions and 
we are focused on the outcomes and impacts 
of bringing solutions to the beneficiaries. We 
are committed to that and that is why we have 
brought every one of you to this meeting. 
IWMI has been addressing water and land-related 
issues in Ghana, particularly for the past 20 years, 
and we recognize that it is important to pay 
attention to water. As climate change is evolving, 
we know the atmosphere is warming up, the water 
cycle is changing and we see more severe and 
less predictable floods and drought events. We all 
witnessed the flood events carried in the news. 
We see the poor water quality, outbreaks of water-
borne diseases, and rising sea levels, with more 
risks, uncertainties and unknowns. In the midst 
of these, we have to use water for productive 
activities; we have to use water to produce food; 
we have to access water to meet our basic needs 
and we have to use water to rear fish. Water is very important, and water is life, as people say. 
Therefore, it is very important that as a CGIAR 
organization; we pay attention to water challenges 
and water solutions that help us drive our 
development agenda in Ghana. As a knowledge 
institute, IWMI has developed an action framework 
for climate-resilient water management that builds 
resilience into decision-making at all levels, and we 
did this across four main domains: 
First, we support infrastructure technology and 
overall management around technology and 
water infrastructure. This means we look at where 
the challenges are and how infrastructure coupled 
with bundled management solutions can help us 
maximize available water for food production. An 
example is a small-scale irrigation. We are working 
closely with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, 
the Ghana Agricultural Sector Investment 
Programme (GASIP) and the Ghana Irrigation 
Development Authority (GIDA) at different 
levels to support small-scale irrigation around 
infrastructure. We see opportunities here to 
include fisheries and integrate fish and crops, and 
even livestock systems to ensure that we diversify 
food sources and income for our smallholder 
farmers. This is very important. We recommend 
climate-smart solutions, bundled with agronomy, 
water management measures, information 
services, and market solutions to drive the use of 
these resources appropriately.
Second, governance and participation. We believe 
that we cannot do it all alone, we do not have 
all the solutions and we need everyone. It is not 
just about technology, it is not just about science, 
it is not just about indigenous knowledge, and 
it is not just about people’s perceptions and 
how they want to use their resources. Therefore, 
governance and participation are very important 
for us. For instance, we are working together with 
the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, CSIR Science 
Technology Policy Research Institute (STEPRI), the 
University of Ghana, Legon and the University 
of Development Studies (UDS), to look at social 
transformation processes in Upper West Region – 
how are the communities responding to building 
resilience against climate change and what will it 2. Project commencement
Page 11:
7look like in years to come. With funding from the 
European Union Commission in Ghana, we are 
supporting the government of Ghana to come 
up with scenarios and mechanisms to inform 
the planning processes at the District Assemblies 
level. That is one of the solutions we are enacting 
and contributing to in terms of governance and 
participation in Ghana. 
Third, we believe that knowledge is power, and 
information and learning are very important. 
Therefore, we developed capabilities across 
technology data and policy, we developed tools 
and decision support instruments to help us 
make the right decisions to use water. We take 
advantage of open data, satellite images, with 
ground truthing to create applications that help 
people decide in terms of when to use water, how 
to use water, where, and how to allocate water at 
the basic level and how farmers can learn to use 
water at the ground level. Recently, in Zebilla1, we 
introduced a water application tool–a very simple 
tool, costing only $10-15, which farmers can use 
to help them know how to use water during the 
dry season. We realized that these farmers, while 
they were using water to irrigate their crops, 
they think they do not have enough water, so 
they apply water every 3 or 4 days and they are 
groaning because they do not have enough water 
during the dry season. We all know that they have 
only one production season in the north. But 
with this tool and from our participatory action 
research they realized they do not have to apply 
water every three days, they realized that they 
have enough water, and the crop will need water 
every eight days. That saves them a lot of water, 
a lot of energy and even fuel. So, we use simple 
tools and decision-support instruments that help 
not only farmers but also water planners. We also 
downscale remote sensing images which we use 
to develop applications that people can use to 
make water management decisions. 
Finally, we also know it is important to look at 
everything holistically at a systems level. We 
try to connect the dots, not just one solution. 
We look at landscape approaches at the 
system level connecting markets, and private 
sector engagements with farmers’ needs, with 
community participation to bring holistic solutions 
to some challenges that we find on the ground. It 
is more like applying system-level approaches to 
bring up solutions. These are some things we are doing, and we are 
so privileged that we have the opportunity to also 
launch this project, for which CGIAR has provided 
seed funding. It is small and strategic, in the sense 
that we can launch something on integrated 
systems, and we can leverage existing initiatives 
of aquaculture for food and jobs and one village 
and one dam. With our innovations, we are already 
doing a lot with One District One Factory and 
Planting for Food and Jobs. We see the Aquaculture 
for food and jobs initiative as an opportunity to 
contribute to what the Ministry of Fisheries and 
Aquaculture Development is doing. With the small 
seed to start something, I am looking forward to an 
opportunity where we can leverage this seed and 
make it bigger. This is going to give us some pilot 
projects, but we are looking at covering the whole 
of Ghana with innovations until we have a good fish 
and nutrition diet on the table of every Ghanaian. 
2.3. Solidarity statement delivered by Dr 
Anthony Yaw Karikari, Deputy Director of 
CSIR Water Research Institute on behalf of 
the Director of the Institute Prof. Yaw Osei 
Atweneboana
The CSRI-WRI’s mandate is to research water and 
other water-related resources. Therefore, this 
project aligns with the CSRI-WRI because we deal 
with everything related to water. We also gather 
information, and data, and create strategies for the 
socioeconomic development of our country. In our 
system, we have several divisions, and one of them 
is the Environmental Chemistry and Sanitation 
Engineering Division. There, we have a laboratory 
that deals with water quality-related issues, so if 
there are any associated problems with it, we will 
render our services and ensure that we are using 
quality water for our projects. 
We also have an Environmental Biology, Health 
and Biotechnology Division, Surface Water and 
Climate Change Division, and a Fishery and 
Aquaculture Division. So, you understand why 
we are very much privileged to be part of this 
project. We also have the Aquaculture Research 
Development Centre at Akosombo, where we 
produce fingerlings for fish farmers all over Ghana. 
We also offer training in aquaculture development 
which contributes to our research activities and 
services towards ensuring the availability of 
abundant food for the population. 
Page 12:
8The CSIR-WRI is very much excited about being 
part of this project. We know you are discussing 
resilient aquatic food systems and this is a complex 
web of the elements and activities relating to food 
and water, along with the broader economic, 
social and natural environment in which they 
are embedded. We believe the development of 
an aquatic food system will provide the needed 
nutritional requirement and support the fishery 
system that we are establishing in the reservoirs 
within the One Village One Dam Project, which is 
an excellent effort by the government of Ghana. 
2.4. Solidarity statement by Deputy 
Executive Director of Fisheries Commission, 
Paul Bannerman
The Resilient Aquatic Food Systems project 
is laudable that will help us bridge the gap 
between our demand and the supply of fish 
needs in the country. Ghana’s fish deficit in 
2020 was around 771, 000 metric tons, of which 
over 60% of national fish requirements are 
being acquired via exports. Ghana is endowed 
with a long coastline and several freshwater 
bodies within the Volta Basin. Especially in the 
northern part of the country, where we can use 
these outlets to increase our food production. 
But without adequate information and data 
emanating from our fisheries, we cannot 
successfully manage and develop new initiatives. 
This project involves all stakeholders–I can see a 
lot of managers, researchers and regulators here 
at the helm of this project. I believe the future is 
bright and we will all benefit from it. 
We are all aware that aquaculture is the bedrock 
from which we are trying to overcome the 
deficiencies in our marine sector. Therefore, we 
know that this project will help create more jobs, 
improve food security and enhance the livelihoods 
of women and youth along the water bodies and 
the value chain. 
The Fisheries Commission, with offices in all 16 
regions, will participate fully with its expertise to 
ensure this project succeeds, resulting in good 
quality fish on our tables. Not only good quality 
fish but also good quality water for our livelihoods. 2.5. Solidarity statement delivered by Eric 
Samuel Adu Danquah, Director of Planning, 
Monitoring and Coordination of Ghana 
Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA) 
on behalf of the Chief Executive Engineer 
Wilson Darkwah 
This project is aimed at improving the productivity 
of aquaculture, which is one of the key benefits 
of stored water irrigation schemes or small dams’ 
irrigation schemes. In the past, some of our 
irrigation dams were designed and constructed 
to include fishponds to encourage fish farming 
as a livelihood venture. A good example is 
the Kpong Irrigation Scheme, where a private 
company is producing fingerlings in the fishponds 
constructed for fish farmers around Volta Lake. 
However, we have not taken advantage of 
such facilities to improve the livelihood of our 
farmers around our small dams, especially 
in the north. I believe this intervention is 
going to reverse this phenomenon and 
make aquaculture productive to impact the 
nutritional status of the beneficiary communities 
and provide a livelihood for the people. 
The government, through the Ministry of Special 
Development Initiatives, implemented the One 
Village One Dam project to make water for 
productive uses available at all times in northern 
Ghana. Over 200 small dams were built under 
this initiative. The capacity of some of them may 
not be suitable for this project, because they 
may dry up in the dry season. For this reason, 
the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority 
(GIDA) attempted to construct small irrigation 
dams to complement the initiative and has 
completed 10 small dams, constructing eight 
more and has plans to construct more when 
funds are available. The capacity of these dams 
is such that water is always available to support 
aquaculture, livestock watering, domestic uses 
and crop production all year round. Drawdown 
of the water leaves behind depth storage 
for aquaculture and livestock watering. 
This workshop on the CGIAR Resilient Aquatic 
Food Systems Initiative is for us to understand the 
concept and share experiences and lessons from 
our respective fields to make the project a success.

93.1. Presentation CGIAR by Dr Kwesi Atta-Krah 
Regional and Country Engagement Advisor 
– West and Central Africa (WCA) Initiative
CGIAR is now transitioning into the One CGIAR. 
CGIAR is a family of international research 
institutions. There were 15 institutions but 
now there are 13 of them. They include 
IWMI, IITA, World Fish, Alliance Biodiversity 
CIAT, CIP, CIMMYT, IRRI, IFPRI based in 
Washington DC, ILRI based in Kenya, Africa 
Rice, ICARDA, ICRISAT and CIFOR-ICRAF. 
What the CGIAR effort is all about, given the 
global challenges we are facing now, is that it is 
wise for us to find ways to work together as an 
agricultural outfit to address the global challenges 
we face. You cannot have fish if you do not have 
water. Therefore, water is important and even 
if you have fish, you want to eat it with cassava 
and you want to eat it with rice. What the CGIAR 
is trying to show is that, apart from the fact that 
the challenges are multiplying globally, especially 
the challenge of climate change, there are all 
kinds of opportunities if we work together. And 
that is why in the last two years, we have been 
working on this reform to create a family that 
we call “CGIAR.” The One CGIAR is more unified 
and integrated. In terms of the reform process, 
it is a dynamic reformulation of the partnerships 
that we have been working with through the 13 
centres. One CGIAR gives us dynamism and we 
must say CGIAR does not weaken your regional 
centres. That is a very important point to make. 
Regional centres, like IWMI, will continue to 
operate and will be strengthened through the 
CGIAR. We see all these centres as essential 
building blocks of what One CGIAR is trying to do. 
So why now? Why are we getting into it? Some 
of the CGIAR centres have been in operation for 
almost 60 years, while others, like IWMI, are much 
younger. During that period, there have been 
many global impacts through the CGIAR centres. 
As I have said, today we have multiple challenges–
the food and nutrition security challenge is 
much bigger and growing, biodiversity loss and economic growth through agriculture need to be 
multiplied and we need to strengthen resilience 
whether you talking about water systems, given 
the climate change, and obviously, a climate crisis 
and we have to do all this in an integrated way. 
This makes it so important that we work together 
rather than having different groups act separately. 
The CGIAR has recognition from organizations 
including the United Nations, AGRA and 
individuals like Bill Gates and their statements 
affirm the importance of CGIAR. The vision 
of CGIAR is to have “a world with sustainable 
and resilient food, land and water systems 
that deliver diverse, healthy, safe, sufficient 
and affordable diets, and ensure improved 
livelihoods and greater social equality, within 
global and regional environmental boundaries.”
We want women and men working together in 
charity as we work through this CGIAR. So, we are 
creating a new organization and the centres are 
key parts of that. We have consolidated our work 
into four coherent groups. Three of these four 
groups developed globally and that is important. 
What it means is that you pick a particular theme 
such as “adaptation to climate change,” and this 
is recognized as a global challenge. Then we say 
let us develop this program as a global program, 
so it involves people from all over the world. 
However, some components of the program 
will be implemented locally in the countries. 
We have identified that in the work that we do, 
whether it is in the global initiative or within 
the regionally integrated initiative, we have to 
target several regions. CGIAR has chosen to 
work in six regions of the world. And the first 
one of these regions is CWANA, which is Central 
West Asia and North Africa. You know our 
North African brothers are much closer to the 
countries of central and west Asia, so they have 
one group. The rest are Southern Asia (SA); West 
and Central Africa (WCA); South East Asia and 
the Pacific (SEA and P); Eastern Southern Africa 
(ESA); and then Latin America Caribbean (LAC). 3. Thematic presentations

the six regions that the CGIAR is working in. The

A five -day training of trainers (ToT) workshop was implemented from November 7 to 
November 11, 2022, in Lusaka, Zambia by the International Research I nstitute for 
Climate and Society (IRI) in collaboration with the Zambia Meteorological Department 
(ZMD) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). The workshop, 
which was organized as part of the World Bank’s Accelerating the Impact of CGIAR 
Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project, brought together 18 participants from 
the Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD) alongside the Zambia Agriculture 
Research Institute (ZARI), the Ministry of Green Economy and Environment (MGEE), 
the Water Resou rces Management Authority (WARMA), the Ministry of Agriculture 
(MoA), the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), and the International 
Crops Research Institute for the Semi -Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) to be trained on ZMD’s 
existing suite of free onli ne ENACTS Maprooms. The major objective of the workshop 
was to ensure that each of these institutions that play an important role in promoting 
the use of climate information and services and broader resilience of the agricultural 
sector are aware of and ha ve the capacity to train users within Zambia on the best -
available climate information products for decision -making. The ENACTS maproom 
products, which are freely available through ZMD’s website, provide location -specific 
(4 km grid) historical, monitoring , and forecast information that is important for 
activities related to planning, monitoring, and response for the agricultural sector and 
wider food system.

launched an MSD in February 2022 to share ideas on how to scale climate -smart  
aquaculture (CSA) and climate information services (CIS). The workshop in Ma nsa was 
one in a series of meetings planned for the AICCRA Zambia CSA -CIS MSD platform. This 
particular MSD workshop focused on aquaculture, especially issues related to (i) 
financing for smallholder farmers and small - and medium -scale enterprises (SMEs) i n 
the face of climate change, (ii) benchmarking and credit worthiness of a smallholder 
fish farmers, and (iii) sharing practical experiences from integrated fish farms, the 
Aquaculture Development Association of Zambia (ADAZ) and banks. In addition, 
partic ipants also made a field visit to an integrated fish farm in Samfya District, Luapula 
Province.  
 
CSA -CIS training report for the aquaculture bundle.  Training on climate -smart 
aquaculture (CSA) and climate information systems (CIS) targeted small - and mediu m-
scale entrepreneurs (SMEs) offering aquaculture -related goods and services and 
fisheries extension officers. WorldFish hosted the training, with facilitators from the 
organization as well as Alliance Bioversity and the International Institute of Tropical  
Agriculture (CIAT). The main focus was on integrated aquaculture -agriculture systems 
(IAAS) under CSA Bundle 2 (integrated aquaculture systems) of the Accelerating the 
Impact of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa ( AICCRA Zambia) project. A total of 58 
part icipants, 34 percent of whom were women, took part in the CSA and CIS training.  
 
CSA training . The CSA training introduced participants to basic climate change 
concepts and also  adaptation and mitigation strategies in the face of climate change 
risks. It introduced climate -smart agriculture, especially climate -smart approaches in 
aquaculture. Experts from WorldFish introduced participants to IAAS under the 
auspices of climate cha nge. The training covered key concepts such as climate, 
weather, climate change, resilience, mitigation, vulnerability, gender, and the 
importance of IAAS. The training included climate change games and role -playing 
activities involving decision -making on site selection, fish species and integrated 
aquaculture. These games were used to help participants understand the concepts 
and make climate -related decisions on fishstocking, site selection, fish species and 
other crops based on the probability of receivi ng average rainfall, flooding or drought. 
Results of the games showed participants why access to CSA practices and CIS 
services is important since farmers without access make ill -informed decisions and 
suffer as a result of climate -related disasters.  
 
By the end of the training, SMEs and extension agents could define and differentiate 
climate, weather, climate change, adaptation, mitigation an d resilience, as well as other 
terms.  The participants appreciated this gameplay because it gave them a practical 
scenario of what they go through and called on the facilitators to carry on with their 
work of enhancing farmers' access to CIS and climate -smart agriculture technologies 
to improve water, food and energy security in the country. Furthermore, participants 
toured one farm practicing IAAS to expose them to CSA technologies discussed in the 
training sessions.   
 
CIS training . CIS training introduced  climate -information concepts and services 
related to aquaculture and agriculture value chains. The participants were given an 
opportunity to understand the value of weather and climate services to fish value 
chain actors. The session further provided an a nalysis of climate change, climate

involved reading weather pattern graphs that showed minimum and maximum 
temperatures, and calculating probabilities of various weather event s and their 
relevance to decision -making in agriculture and aquaculture. Data Art for Climate 
Action (DACA), a climate advisory tool accessible on Google Play for Android phones, 
was used as a practical example for accessing and reading climate information  for 
decision -making. DACA has various climate advisories, such as recommended bean 
variety for a particular place in any the coming season, the probability of exceeding 
the length of a given growing season, and the probability of exceeding a given 
seasona l rainfall total, as well as many others. At the end of the CIS session, 
participants could read and interpret climate change or climate variability graphs.   
 
Gender equality and social inclusion . The training also focused on GESI, in which the 
facilitator s introduced concepts so that SMEs could (i) understand what GESI is and 
can distinguish between gender and sex,  (ii) familiarize themselves with core GESI 
concepts and  (iii) become sensitized to power relations and to the marginalization 
different members  of society experience and how this could affect resilience and 
adaptation to climate change.  Emphasis was placed on SMEs and extension agents to 
ensure that CSA approaches and access to CIS do not exacerbate or perpetuate 
gender and other social dis parities and instead reduce disparities and empower 
women, girls and disadvantaged groups in society.

The report presents the survey results on WEF Nexus teaching in South African higher and tertiary education institutions. The main findings of the survey are that; there is general knowledge of the WEF Nexus in the country, some of the institutions have been involved in WEF Nexus 'training' for a while now, WEF Nexus activities are found mainly in water-related departments at most institutions, WEF Nexus related work is mainly embedded in MSc and PhD research programmes, the WEF Nexus covered are wide but focused mainly on concepts, frameworks and application of models and tools. Most believed WEF Nexus should be focused on postgraduate students, and their institutions would welcome WEF Nexus-related teaching and learning.
The deliverable also reports two WEF Nexus short course training undertaken in 2021 and 2022, initially virtually (due to Covid-19 restrictions) and then in person in 2022. The short courses were very well received, attracting more than 80 participants worldwide for the virtual versions and some 50 students for the in-person training. Details of the course contents of the training are presented in the report.

6 Executive Summary  
This is a report on  the s urvey of WEF Nexus teaching in selected higher education and tertiary 
institutions in South Africa , outcomes of the WEF Nexus short training programmes , and the 
development of  WEF Nexus teaching material . 
The report presents the survey results on WEF Nexus  teaching in South African higher and tertiary 
education institutions. The main findings of the survey are that; there is general knowledge of the 
WEF Nexus in the country, some of the institutions have been involved in WEF Nexus 'training' for a 
while now , WEF Nexus activities are found mainly in water -related departments at most institutions, 
WEF Nexus related work is mainly embedded in MSc and PhD research programmes, the WEF Nexus 
covered are wide but focused mainly on concepts, frameworks and applicati on of models and tools. 
Most believed WEF Nexus should be focused on postgraduate students, and their institutions would 
welcome WEF Nexus -related teaching and learning.  
The deliverable also reports two WEF Nexus short course training undertaken in 2021 and 2022, 
initially virtually (due to Covid -19 restrictions) and then in person in 2022. The short courses were 
very well received, attracting more than 80 participants worldwide for the virtual versions and some 
50 students for the in -person training . Details of the course contents of the training are presented in 
the report.

7 Introduction  
Background  
Rapid population and economic growth accelerated urbani sation , and changing lifestyles have led to 
the rising global demand for water, food, and energy. Meeting Sustainable Development Goal s (SDG) 
2 (zero hunger), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SGD  7 (Clean and affordable energy) will 
require greater efficiencies in agricultural production systems globally (using water and energy). 
During the late  2000s and early 2010s, the WEF Nexus  emerged as an integral approach to managing 
the three resource sectors of water, energy, and food. In theory, the WEF Nexus  means that water 
security, energy security and food security are ultimately linked, and resour ce use and availability 
rely heavily on each other (Pardoe et al ., 2018) . Hence, the goal of the WEF Nexus  is to approach 
resource management more holistically by utilising a multi - or poly -centric philosophy. The WEF 
Nexus  provides the oppo rtunity to move beyond the current sectoral approach to policymaking to 
highlight the interlinkages between the sectors and the need to implement system thinking to wards  
achiev ing the SDGs. The WEF Nexus  presents an opportunity for policymakers, researcher s, and 
development agencies to integrate the sectors to optimi se the use of the resource base, maximi se 
synergies and minimi se trade -offs and conflicts.   
Developing countries, particularly those experiencing significant trade -offs between water, energy, 
and food , such as South Africa, will benefit significantly from the integrated resource management 
approach that the WEF Nexus  provides. South Africa is currently facing many challenges concerning 
water, energy, and food security, making it imperat ive that future development is anchored in WEF 
Nexus  approaches. Thus, the operationali sation of the WEF Nexus  at various spatial and temporal 
scales within South Africa can address the challenges related to water, energy, and food resource 
insecurities (M abhaudhi et al., 2016a; Nhamo et al., 2018).  
Universities in South Africa have taken up the WEF Nexus  approach as  an integral part of research 
and are involved in projects to maximi se synergies between WEF sectors. Most of the existing 
projects have a focu s on conceptual and discourse -level WEF Nexus  applications. The University of 
Cape Town has a WRC -funded project focusing on generating evidence for the WEF Nexus  at a local 
scale. It focuses on catchment and household -level analyses. The University of Ste llenbosch has been 
developing WEF Nexus  proposals focusing on the Western Cape and Cape Town, particularly a city 
WEF Nexus  study. The University of KwaZulu -Natal (UKZN) has completed a WEF Nexus  assessment 
study for South Africa and is currently undertaki ng a new WRC -funded project and looking at WEF 
Nexus  research in food systems through the Sustainable and Healthy Food Systems (SHEFS) 
programme. UKZN also has a project called Rural and Urban Nexus for Resilient Cities (RUNRES), 
which focuses on applying nexus approaches to promote the transition to a circular approach. The 
UKZN -led projects concentrate on the WEF Nexus  analytical models and the operationali sation of 
the WEF Nexus . 
Purpose of this report  
It has been highlighted that the discussion on the WEF Nexus  needed to be broadened to include the 
participation of other sectors , not water -centric,  driven by water exper ts. It was noted that it has not 
yet been institutionali sed in the curriculum.  The objective of the report is  to describe the outcome of 
Page 10:
8 the survey conducted on a curriculum analysis of WEF Nexus teaching and learning at selected 
tertiary institutions (technical colleges and universities) in South Africa . The study looked at the  who, 
what and how much of the WEF Nexus  material is covered in the certificate, diploma, and degree 
programmes. The deliverable  also report s on the outcome of two training programmes (WEF Nexus 
winter school , conducted in person , and WEF Nexus Master Class, conducted virtually ) to 
demonstr ate the operationali sation of WEF Nexus  curricula . 
Literature  Review  
The Water -Energy -Food (WEF) Nexus  
The argument for the WEF Nexus  has, by now , been adequately articulated , given the background 
that by 2030 the global population will need at least 40% more water, 35% more food and 50% more 
energy. By 2050, a 70% increase in global food demand is predicted. Meeting the demand for food in 
sufficient quantities and acceptable n utritious quality underlines the importance of greater global 
efficiencies in agricultural production systems  (using water and energy). By 2025, 40% of the global 
population will be prone to severe physical and economic water stress . It is against this bac kground 
that the WEF Nexus  came to the fore as a viable decision support tool that , among other things , 
indicates the performance of resource utilisation and planning, establishes a quantitative 
relationship among interlinked resources, and indicates prior ity areas for intervention, aimed at 
establishing a balanced resource use and planning, and inclusive economic growth for sustainable 
development (Nhamo et al., 2020). Thus, the method catalyses  climate change adaptation and 
resilience -building by improvin g human well -being and attaining Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), particularly SDGs 2, 6, and 7 (Mabhaudhi et al., 2019).  
The WEF Nexus  has gained undivided attention in the agenda of research, policy dialogue and 
development (Bazilian et al., 2011; E ftelioglu et al., 2017). This has seen the WEF Nexus  being 
mainstreamed into thematic areas, strategies and policies by local, regional, and international 
institutions, governments, and organi sations (SADC, 2016; GWP -SA, 2019a; GWP -SA, 2019b). The 
nature a nd significance of interconnections between the WEF resources are context -specific, hence 
the need to explore and understand the interdependence of water, energy and food security and the 
natural resources that underpin their security (Liu et al., 2017; Sa lam et al., 2017). Despite the hype 
of the WEF Nexus  agenda, several authors concur that the actual translation of the theory into 
practice is lagging hence the need to investigate the limited uptake of the promising approach 
(Byers, 2015; Daher and Mohtar, 2015; Liu et al., 2017; Galaitsi et al., 2018; McG rane et al., 2019; 
Nhamo et al., 2020a; Naidoo et al., 2021).  
The Water -Energy -Food (WEF) Nexus Dimensions and its Uptake as a Practice  
Being a relat ively new concept (since about 2011) , the WEF Nexus  comes across with many 
definitions and conceptualisatio ns as it is understood differently by different users and its diverse 
utility. For example, t he WEF Nexus  has been called a conceptual framework, a concept, a discourse, 
an analytical tool, an innovation and , more recently , a practice. Worldwide the WEF Ne xus has been 
applied to a wide range of cases, both in space and time. Despite its popularity, as evidenced by the 
exponential growth in research publications to do with the WEF Nexus  (see Deliverables 1 and 3) , its 
wider uptake and application have remain ed relatively  low, both in South Africa and across the 
Page 11:
9 world . It has generally been applied only on a case study basis , and tools and models developed 
have also shown very limited application across space and time scales (Taguta et al., 2022) . There is 
no evidence of wholesale mainstreaming of the WEF Nexus  as a planning tool for natural resources 
management. As discussed in Deliverable 5 of this research, t he question that arises then is, why  is 
there no wholesale uptake and application of the WEF Nexus , especially in government departments 
mandated with natural resources management ? 
In formulating this research, pertinent questions were asked , and some of these include:  
▪ How best can the WEF Nexus  be applied in the context of South Africa's problems?  
▪ How ca n the WEF Nexus  move from theory to analysis to practice in South Africa?  
▪ How can the WEF Nexus  be packaged and applied to reali se SDGs 2, 6 and 7 in South Africa?  
▪ Are there any tertiary institutions teaching the WEF Nexus  in South Africa , as was the case 
with the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) concept and practice?  
The last question in the list above is particularly pertinent : Are any higher education and tertiary 
institutions in South Africa involved in teaching and learning  the WEF Nex us? To answer this 
question, a curriculum review needs to assess what is on the ground, what gaps exist, how these 
gaps can be filled, and  by who, how and when.  
Curriculum Development, Curriculum Review and Curriculum Reform 
Processes  
Simply put, the curri culum comprises  a course of study to be taken by students at a learning 
institution. Curriculum development , curriculum review and curriculum reform  are three  related but 
different processes. Curriculum development , by and large , implies the development of  a (new) 
curriculum or programme of teaching  and learning  from 'scratch ' answering the questions ""what will 
be taught, who will be taught, and how it will be taught "". On the other hand,  curriculum re view 
generally means a curriculum exists and is now being  re-looked to improve  it to serve a particular 
purpose : to enhance student learning, engagement, experience and outcomes  (Drummond et al ., 
1999) . Related to the two is c urriculum reform , which is a process of making changes to the 
curriculum to make  teaching and learning more meaningful and effective.  
There are several ways of undertaking curriculum development, curriculum review and curriculum 
reform, but all have some commonalities regarding  the steps to follow. The review's main purpose is 
to dete rmine  the depth of detail required for the individual steps. For example, one might be 
involved in a cursory review of certain aspects of a curriculum that will culminate in less than a 10% 
change to the curriculum . This can be compared to a detailed revie w of all aspects of a curriculum 
resulting in substantial changes to that curriculum. Below are the general steps followed in 
curriculum review, and these are not hard and fast but a guide.  They comprise the key steps of 
planning, content and methods devel opment, implementation, and evaluation.  
 
 
 
Page 12:
10 STEP 1 : Need for Curriculum Review : What is the need for curriculum review?  
STEP 2 : Form Curriculum Review Committee : Determine who will be involved in the curriculum 
process.  
STEP 3 : Terms of Reference (ToR) : Out line the ToR of the Curriculum Review Committee  and the 
timeline for the review . 
STEP 4 : Undertake Curriculum Review : Attend to the following issues:  
▪ What is the current curriculum?  
▪ Who are the key stakeholders?  
▪ Who are the target lea rners?  
▪ What are the target outcomes of the learning?  
▪ What are the teaching methods?  
▪ What are the assessment methods?  
▪ What are the gaps or required changes in the current curriculum?  
STEP 5 : Develop New/ Revised Curriculum : Based on STEP 4, develop a revised or new curriculum to 
meet the needs of learners and expected learning outcomes.  
STEP 6a: Recruit and/or Capacitate Teachers/Instructors : If needed, capacitate or recruit teachers 
or instructors required to teach the new  or revised curriculum.  
STEP 6b : Upgrade/Update Teaching Facilities/Resources : If needed, update or develop required 
resources, e.g., laboratories, libraries, etc.  
STEP 7 : Pilot New/Revised Curriculum : Pilot teach the new or revised curriculum and adjust i t as 
needed.  
STEP 8 : Implement New/Revised Curriculum : Implement the new or revised curriculum with 
capacitated teachers and upgraded facilities . 
STEP 9 : Monitor and Evaluate Implementation of New/Revised Curriculum : Monitor and evaluate 
the new or revised  curriculum implementation . 
STEP 10 : Go to STEP 1 : After an appropriate period and depending on developments, go to STEP 1.  
As pre viously stated, the above steps are generic and can be modified depending on the need for 
curriculum reform.  Concerning  the current WEF Nexus  teaching and learning in the context of South 
Africa, the above steps apply. This Deliverable touches on Steps 1 to 4 above , as reported in 
Section  3.

11 Embedding Water -Energy -Food (WEF) Nexus into Tertiary Institutions 
Curri culum  
In line with the above discussion, and as part of enhancing the uptake and practice of WEF Nexus  as 
a natural resource  planning and management approach in South Africa, it is expected that WEF 
Nexus  material will and should be included in the teachin g and learning in institutions of higher and 
tertiary learning. This can also be considered as part of deep -scaling the WF nexus in South Africa. A 
parallel equivalent is the IWRM concept which has been part of higher and tertiary education in 
South Africa  and the world to such an extent that it is now part and parcel of daily  operations in 
most departments dealing with water issues. The WEF Nexus  is better because it is not water -centric 
but gives equal weight to the three resources of water, energy and fo od, ensuring synergistic 
management of these.  
How can this be practically undertaken in South Africa , and over what timeline? Concerning  how it 
can be done, a survey of the WEF Nexus  curriculum in South Africa was undertaken and is reported 
in Section 3 of  this report.  In terms of the timeline, this will be after the end of this research project 
because it is acknowledged that curriculum review and change in South Africa take an inordinate 
amount of time , running up to 5 years from start to finish.

12 Survey  on Water -Energy -Food (WEF) Nexus 
Curriculum Analysis at Selected Tertiary 
Institutions in South Africa  
This section presents the results of a survey undertaken to analyse the teaching of WEF Nexus -
related material at some South African tertiary institutions.  
Methodology  
A questionnaire survey was administered to 28 institutions of higher learning in South A frica.  The 
questionnaire was administered online using Google Form s. The UKZN Humanities and Social 
Sciences Research Ethics Committee ethically reviewed and approved the survey as part of a more 
extensive WEF study (approval number HSS/1971/017D).  Data we re downloaded to Excel software. 
The analysis of the results, including graphs and frequencies, was done on Google Forms . Ten 
completed questionnaires , representing a 36% return,  were received and included in the analysis.   
Findings  
Respondent details  
The respondents represented a cross -section of disciplines found in academic and research 
institutions, i.e., s enior lecturers, professors, research chairs, and research directors of learning 
institutions. The respondents related to varying departments, most of which had an agriculture 
focus, environmental management centres, water,  and sanitation , built environment , and 
bioresources engineering . Eight respondents had been involved in reviewing and developing new 
curricula at the undergraduate or postgradua te level.  The remaining two were unrelated to 
curriculum development issues in the university system.  
General information on participating i nstitution  
Figure 1 shows the location of the institutions involved in the survey, spanning six of the country's 
nine provinces. All the institutions in clud ed in the study offer undergraduate , Master and PhD  
degree  programmes, whilst nine offer Diploma programmes, and only five provide Certificate 
courses.

Knowledge of WEF Nexus  
All respondents indicated that some members of their institutions were aware of WEF Nexus. Nine 
out of the ten respondents had been  involved in  WEF Nexus research. Nine of the ten respondents 
also indicated that their institutions were involved in the incorporation of Integrated Water 
Resources Management (IWRM) into teaching and research.  
WEF Nexus Teaching and Learning  
All respondents had been involved in aspects of WEF Nexus teaching and research for a period 
ranging from three to 20 years. This would suggest that there is a view that WEF teaching and 
research was initiated earlier than the last ten years when it was populari sed. Departments or 
centres involved in WEF Nexus teaching and learning in the various institutions were Environmental 
Management, Development Studies, Water Resources Management, Water and Sanitation 
Research, Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Science s, South African Renewable 
Technology Centre, Earth Sciences, Bioresources Engineering, Transformative Agriculture and Food 
Systems, and Water Resources Research. WEF Nexus training is being conducted primarily at the 
postgraduate level in all institutions . Three  institutions offer undergraduate -level  degrees , four at 
the diploma level, and two indicated that WEF Nexus training is conducted at the certificate level. 
Figure 2 shows that WEF Nexus is primarily embedded in the curriculum at the postgraduate le vel 
and less so at undergraduate , diploma and short courses.

Figure 3: Aspects of WEF Nexus covered in the curriculum  
 
 
Findings showed that only two institutions had specific modules  for WEF Nexus: An overview of the 
WEF Nexus  concepts, WEF Nexus Master Class and WEF Nexus Winter School. Two respondents 
indicated that they did not have stand -alone , precisely termed WEF Nexus, but they have modules 
with aspects of WEF Nexus in the curr iculum. Other institutions offer  modules such as Water 
Resources Assessment, Water Resources Management, Environmental Science, and Sustainable 
Development: Policy and Practice. One respondent indicated that while their institution offered no 
WEF Nexus -related module s, they only conduct ed research. Most respondents indicated that WEF 
Nexus is assessed through postgraduate dissertations and theses. At the same time, four 0 1 2 3 4Part of Diploma curriculumPart of Undergraduate curriculumPart of Honours curriculumPart of MSc curriculumPart of PhD curriculumAs a stand-alone regular short courseAs a stand-alone ad hoc short course

15 respondents  mentioned assessing  WEF Nexus as case studies, practical reports, or f ormal tests and 
examinations.  
All respondents believe there are gaps in the teaching and learning of WEF Nexus. Seven 
respondents indicated that WEF Nexus has always been part of their curriculum, but they do not 
refer to it as WEF Nexus. In this regard, they teach aspects of water, energy, and food separately, 
focusing primarily on water and food. They expressed that the link across the three elements of WEF 
Nexus is still missing in the curriculum, and there is no clarity on how the connection can be created. 
One respondent mentioned that although training on water was conducted across all faculties at 
their institution, it is taught only in the Faculty of Agriculture, and Energy is in the Faculty of 
Engineering. The gap lies in how best to incorporate WEF becau se curriculum development is costly 
and takes time. Other respondents indicated that there is very little content on WEF Nexus covered 
in undergraduate agricultural courses because there is inadequate space and time in the modules to 
have depth. One respon dent indicated that their institution did not cover operationali sation , 
systems dynamics modelling and social aspects of WEF Nexus.  
Findings showed that advocacy for incorporating aspects of WEF into the curriculum is needed to 
improve WEF Nexus teaching a nd learning. Respondents suggested various ways that can be applied 
to strengthen WEF Nexus teaching and learning . Summer schools and short courses were 
recommended for imparting WEF knowledge to students , conducting more research that can 
translate to teaching in the class , and including more WEF Nexus  content in undergraduate courses, 
particularly in the third or fourth -year undergraduate teaching and at the MSc by research. They also 
indicated the need to show the relevance of WEF to diff erent contexts and applications and embed 
the learning more strongly in climate change courses instead of just meeting SDG targets.  
Potential for WEF Nexus Expansion/Integration  
Findings showed that WEF Nexus awareness is generally required at various lear ning institutions 
across departments and research centres because few people are working on it. Without 
understanding, implementation will not gain traction. The reason is that academic teaching modules 
are reviewed every five years and end up missing out on topical issues within the five -year horizon. 
Awareness will also improve the understanding of the relevance of WEF to IWRM in a different 
context. Three respondents also menti oned that awareness of the  WEF Nexus approach is crucial 
because it accelerate s transdisciplinary research to provide sustainable solutions to complex 
problems that a single discipline cannot address. In addition,  all three  aspects of WEF Nexus  
represent a critical challenge in South Africa and many other countries and deserve urgen t attention 
on strategies to deal with the challenge.  
Most respondents recommended Agriculture and Environmental studies as the disciplines they 
recommended for housing WEF Nexus teaching. Although one respondent indicated Heath studies, 
and two others su ggested Architecture, Engineering and Construction or Applied Sciences as the 
recommended disciplines to incorporate WEF Nexus in their curricula. Most responses for the 
departments that should be targeted for WEF Nexus expansion or integration pointed to 
Agriculture and Environmental studies. A few respondents indicated Health Studies, Engineering, 
and centres for Water Studies.  Table 1 shows that most respondents view postgraduate studies 
as the targeted trainees for WEF Nexus expansion or integration.

Training of university academics  
Most respondents think there is a need for capacity building of WEF Nexus at their institutions 
because of poor awareness and knowledge among academics. Areas  where capacity building is 
required,  include the relevance of the WEF Nexus to different contexts, operationali sation of the 
approach, system dynamics modelling, WEF Nexus  and investment planning, and WEF Nexus  and the 
practicalities of SDGs. One respondent indicated they require collaboration with institutions  with 
more expertise and resources. Interestin gly, one respondent indicated that awareness across 
institutions is more crucial before capacity building because universities need to understand what is 
new in WEF Nexus and what is already b","7710"

Workshop on Gender and Climate Resilience and Adaptation for Khmer Youth   5 Executive summary  
Background  
Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam has been affected by global climate change. While the effect of 
climate change is global, its impact is unevenly distributed due to existing gender and social 
inequalities in the society. For example, ethnic minority farmers in the coastal area depend heavily on 
natural resources, experiencing greater impacts of climate change. However, their voices are rarely 
reflected in climate adaptation policies and agricul tural technology development.    
  
CGIAR Asian Mega -Deltas Initiative prioritizes co -production of knowledge and co -design of 
agricultural innovations based on varied needs and interests. In particular, the initiative seeks to 
incorporate voices of young pe ople, women farmers, and ethnic minorities.    
  
In this workshop, we invite young ethnic minority students at the Agriculture and Aquaculture School 
of Tra  Vinh University to join in this co -learning opportunity and share their ideas and opinions from 
the perspectives of their gender, ethnicity and generation .  
Objectives  
The four key objectives of this workshop are set as follows:  
1. Increase the awareness o f climate crisis and its impact on agriculture and aquaculture in the 
Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam.  
2. Understand the process of marginalization and exclusion by gender and ethnicity in climate 
policy and climate adaptation.  
3. Raise youth voices on climate cr isis. 
4. Exchange ideas on climate adaptation and innovation in agriculture and aquaculture.  
About participants  
30 Khmer students who are currently studying at Tra Vinh University joined this workshop. There were 
equal numbers of male and female participants .  Most of the students (22) are residents of Tra Vinh 
province, and a few are from Soc Trang, An Giang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau and Quang Tri provinces. 
Participants’ university majors are Biotechnology (27%), Aquaculture (23%), Agriculture (20%), Food 
Technolog y (17%), and Animal Medicine (13%).  Dr. Thach Thi Dan, Tra Vinh University Vice Rector 
provided an opening speech for the Workshop.  
Key outcomes  
The workshop was a great opportunity for the students to improve their awareness of the current 
situation of climate change in the Mekong delta and Tra Vinh. For most of them, it was their first 
exposure to the idea of gender and diversity in climate adapt ation, as well as global youth movement 
leaders such as Greta Thunberg and events such as COP27. They were also greatly inspired by the 
sustainable agribusiness model of Sokfarm, led by a Khmer woman.  
The group work activity encouraged the students to refl ect, form and exchange ideas on gender, 
diversity and how to cope with climate change. Four ideas were brainstormed with a primary focus on 
innovation and sustainability:

Session  1: Global youth movement on agriculture and climate 
change and why gender matters in climate change  
Presenter: Dr. Nozomi Kawarazuka  (CGIAR/CIP)  
08:35 – 09:00  
 
In the first session, Dr. Nozomi Kawarazuka gave a presentation on the current issues of agriculture 
and climate change, the importance of gender and diversity in the adaptation planning process, and 
the global youth movement to address the issues. She rai sed four important questions for the students 
to think about throughout the presentation:  
 
• What are climate adaptation strategies for agriculture in the Mekong region?  
• Whose opinions are missing in climate adaptation planning ?  
• Why are gender and diversit y important for climate adaptation planning?  
• Why do young people need to have good knowledge on climate change?  
 
First, Nozomi inform ed the audience of the context of climate change  in the Mekong region . The 
average temperature  is increasing , the sea level  is rising, while rainfall has been  increasingly  irregular, 
and extreme weather events have become more and more frequent.  At the worst scenario with 80cm 
sea level raise, more than half of the Mekong region will s ink into the sea , which may happ en around 
2050 . In Tra Vinh, a 40 cm sea level rise would  affect around 20% of the land , but with a  70cm sea 
level rise, more than half of the area will be affected.  
 
The government, universities and private companies are developing various climate change  
adaptation strategies . For example, in agriculture, these include shift ing from rice to other crops and 
Page 8:
 
Workshop on Gender and Climate Resilience and Adaptation for Khmer Youth   8 farming systems , developing  new rice varieties such as salt -resistant variet ies or short -maturity 
variet ies, crop insurance systems , and digital technologies  for weather forecast and flood warning. 
People  are also trying  to utilize available natural resources, such as wind energy and mangrove forest 
to protect coastal areas. Infrastructure is also important such  as hydropower and dams to control 
water level.  
 
However, Nozomi  pointed out that  current strategies were  developed by rich people and for rich 
people, as very poor farmers might not be able to afford these solutions, and the construction of wind 
turbines and hydropower would  affect the lives and incomes  of local poor people .  
 
Next, Nozomi  emphasized  and explained  the importance of  gender and diversity in climate adaptation 
planning. Often times, the voices of women, youth  and ethnic minorities are not included in the 
decision making and planning processes . Agricultural technologies were developed by men and for 
men. Nozomi demonstrated this by showing numerous  photos taken by Hmong farmers in Son La 
province , in which m en use d agricultural machines while women only had machines for housework 
such as sewing machines, rice cookers and water pipes . Women are also farmers abut they have to do 
manual work. This is evidence  that if women are not involved in technology design and development 
process, they cannot benefit from those. The same thing can happen for climate adaptation. If women, 
young people and ethnic minorities are not involved in adaptation planning, the y cannot benefit from 
the planning.  
 
Subsequently , Nozomi explained w hy young people need to have good knowledge on climate change . 
The reason is that p revious generations had plenty of natural resources and many countries have been 
developed by exploitin g the resources. The students’  generation is different. Old development 
business models do not work  anymore . Climate adaptation is a core part of any types of business. 
Knowledge is power. Without knowledge, they  will be left behind from on -going changes. All over the 
world, young people are learning about climate change and raising their voices to global leaders . 
Nozomi gave the examples of Greta Thunberg , and COP27,  where  young ethnic minority people 
participated actively .  
 
 
 
Upon completing the  presentation, Nozomi asked the students to  briefly discuss in small group s and 
answer the four key  questions  she asked them  at the beginning.  
 
Student answers:  
 
• Q: What are climate adaptation strategies for agriculture in the Mekong region?  
A: Current strategies include c hang ing from rice to other crops and aquaculture, salinity 
resistant varieties  and short -maturity varieties to avoid extreme weather , wind energy etc.  
Page 9:
 
Workshop on Gender and Climate Resilience and Adaptation for Khmer Youth   9 • Q: Whose opinions are missing in climate adaptation planning?  
A: The voices of w omen, young people, poor farmers, fishermen etc.  are missing in 
adaptation planning.  
• Q: Why are gender and diversity important for climate adaptation planning?  
A: It’s because t he climate crisis affects everyone, both men and women, and all ethnic 
groups, young and old . 
• Q: Why do young people need to have good knowledge on climate change?  
A: Because young people will bear the consequences of climate change  
 
Session 2: Women's situated knowledge of the climate change  
context  
Presenter: Dr. Ly Quoc Dang  
Mekong  Delta  Development  Research  Institute,  Can Tho University  
09:00 – 10:00  
 
In the second session, Dr. Ly Quoc Dang share d his understanding of “situated knowledge ” to the 
students. His presentation focuses on how local people use their knowledge to cope with local change s, 
the knowledge is accumulated from their experience in their everyday lives. That is scientific, local, 
tradition , and even modern  knowledge. In the context of climate change, local people use new 
knowledge in order to adapt to real and current situation, it is their situated knowledge. Men  and 
women have different experience s based on their  biological,  physical  and social characteri stics . 
Women are  suppose d to be special ac tors, their body has meaning and power, and they are closer to  
the environment  and natural resources. He believes that women have agency to change their 
situation s, they have already adapted to climate change very well thanks to  this special  knowledge  of 
nature.  Dang illustrated this  by examples of specific cases where women are more actively involved in 
environmental protection  activities , and how they use their  feminine strengths to protests against 
authority. He then provided a research framework on the roles of women in the context of climate 
change through situated knowledge .

framework through a case study of Mrs. Thum Choi, a farmer in Soc Trang province. He asked the 
students to read the story and identify the following:  
 
• Signs of cli mate change in the community  
• Knowledge system (5 categories: local, indigenous, modern, traditional , scientific) of Mrs.  
Choi . 
• Other knowledge (body, quality ). 
 
The students were given 5 minutes to read the story, and then  guided through the exercise  by Dang . 
 
Session 3 : Introducing an innovation in agriculture: Sok farm 
coconut nectar – A startup  from local natural resources  
Presenter:  Ms. Thach Thi Chal Thi  
SokFarm Co -Founder, Tieu Can district, Tra Vinh  
10:20  - 11:20  
 
Turning to the last presentation, Ms. Thach Thi Chal Thi presented her coconut nectar start -up 
business  to the students. Graduated with a Master's  degree in Food Technology from Ho Chi Minh 
City University of Technology, Ms. Chal Thi is the co-founder of Sokfarm.  Sokfarm means Happy 
Agriculture with the desire to raise  income  and improve livelihoods for coconut farmers in Tra Vinh, 
and bring health y products  to consumers.  
 
Coconut nectar is hand -collected from coconut blossoms, using  the traditional blossom massaging 
and nectar harvesting techniques of the Khmer in Tra Vinh.  The idea of producing products from 
coconut nectar was born in early 2018, when the price of dried coconuts in Tra Vinh province 
dropped dramatically . With a desire to help her own parents as well as the coconut farmers  in her 
community , Chal Thi conceived the idea of developing coconut nectar products from the second 
largest coconut region of Vietnam.  After three years of hard work and overcoming numerous 
challenges, SokFarm has achieved certain success and recognition in Vietnam as well as the wo rld. 
The startup currently employs 35 office staff and collaborates with 35 farmers with an area of 20 
hectares of coconut, and a processing factory of 500m2. SokFarm has a  wide range of products , 
many of which have been  exported to Cambodia, Japan and the  Netherlands . The model has created 
a new direction for Tra Vinh coconut industry, helping to increase the income  of farmers by 2 -3 
times, contributing to improving local livelihoods and producing high quality agricultural products  
from local natural resou rces. 
 
Chal Thi  believes that business must exist in harmony with the natural environment  and the 
community. At Sokfarm, raw materials are grown , harvested  and processed  under the principles of  
sustainability and environmental protectio n to minimize anthropogenic impacts on the climate.   
 
Chal Thi emphasized  innovation as the foundation  of the business , and happiness as its working  
culture , and  preservation and promotion of traditional skills and knowledge as one of its missions. 
With a focus on local economic development and, Sokfarm aims to support local Khmer farmers. 
Currently, 95% of workers at Sokfarm are  Khmer, of which more than 60% are f emale.   
Sokfarm’s innovation, success and contribution to local community has won the startup multiple 
awards, including social impact awards.

The presentation was followed by a Q&A session. The students were inspired by Ms. Chal Thi  and 
wanted to learn more about her journey. Ms. Chal Thi shared the difficulties she encountered at the 
beginning, and how she managed to overcome them by constant h ard work and perseverance. She 
encouraged the students to be confident and work hard to achieve their goals.  Two female Sokfarm 
employees were also invited to share their experience of working for Sokfarm  with the students . 
 
Student group work  
11:20 – 12:30  
Facilitators:  Nozomi Kawarazuka, Ly Quoc Dang , Trinh Ngoc Ai  
 
By the end of the workshop, we gave length of time to students to reflect on what they learn t from 
the three presenters by asking them to discuss in groups to answer four main  questions  as follows : 
 
1. Current climate change problems  in agriculture/aquaculture in Tra Vinh  
2. Local g ender norm  
3. Local t raditional culture  value   
4. Ideas to make agriculture /aquaculture more attractive to youth and more sustainable and 
adaptable to  climate change.  
 
Each group was then invited to present their discussion and ideas in front of the workshop, followed 
by the facilitators’ comments  and Q&A with the audience.

 Smallholder l ocal farmers grow crops such as  rice, coconut, chili, vegetable s 
etc. Currently,  rice farming system s are being  affected by saline water 
intrusion, flooding, and strong wind s. Coconuts  are being  affected by high 
saline water intrusion.  
The recent farming system s are not sustainable.  
Local farmers use different natural resources: earth/soil, water, air, light . 
However, the soil is affected by saline water, and polluted by pesticide s etc . 
Water sources  are also polluted by pesticide.

Workshop on Gender and Climate Resilience and Adaptation for Khmer Youth   12 Gender norms in Tra 
Vinh  
 - In our community, men  operate  machine s and  do heav y work , while 
women do  house hold chores  and light work.  
- Mostly, women are  involve d in chore s in the family such as tak ing care of 
children  and the  elder ly, clean ing the house  etc. 
- Elder family members usually go to the temple, especially women  because 
they ’re involve d mainly in family duties . 
- The husband’s  name is on the household’s  land ownership.  
- Many young people  migrate to other places because there are no stable 
jobs in the  community we live. In addition, they migrate because they want 
to bring back new knowledge to develop communities.  
Cultural Value in Tra 
Vinh  Khmer festivals: Chol Chmam Thmay, Dol -ta, Oc -om-bok, Kathina.  
Kinh people usually live near  market s, while  Khmer people live around  rice 
farming areas . 
Ideas in making 
agriculture/  
aquaculture more 
attractive to youth 
and more sustainable 
and adaptable to 
climate change  Our team proposes an idea of organic rice - crayfish (tôm càng xanh) 
farming system.  We propose this idea because we want to use less en the 
use of  chemical s (pesticide s and fertilizers ) which  create s problems to the 
soil, water, and air in our community. We think  that it is sustainable, and 
will contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation.  
Moreover , this idea will also contribute to protect ing local people’s health.

 Common  crops  grown by smallholder farmers : rice, coconut, orange, 
vegetables,...  
Negative impacts  of climate change : all crops are being affected by saline 
water intrusion, which delays their growth and eventually  kill the crops .  
Most of these farming systems are not sustainable.  
The resources farmers are using for these farming systems: soil/earth, 
water, light , air.  
Gender norms in Tra 
Vinh  
 - Men  do jobs such as farm ers, industrial workers, office  worke rs, labor ers. 
- Women  are involved in  household chore s such  as cooking, cleaning, 
housekeeping, and other jobs which need meticulous  skills .  
- Women  usually go to th e temple and offer meals to monks. Women  pray 
for “peace and luck"" for the family.  
- Many young people migrate to other places because they can find better 
jobs and high er income.

In order to do this, we have to have good  knowledge  about the plants,  such 
as plant s’ bio-phys iology  and other characteristics . Also, we need  good 
equipment and machines, and technology know -how that we can ap ply. We 
believe  that this idea will benefit farmers and youth.

Workshop on Gender and Climate Resilience and Adaptation for Khmer Youth   13 Group 3  5 male students   
Names of group 
members  Dong, Tai, Thuc, Tan, Vu  
Current problems in 
agriculture/  
aquaculture in Tra 
Vinh  Common  crops : rice, sweet potato, chili, coconut.  
In the climate change context, these plants are under stress, leading to 
decreas ed yield  and quality. These farming systems are not sustainable.  
These crops  use different resources: soil/earth, water, air, light . 
Recently, soil/earth and water are being affected by saline water intrusion 
and acid (phèn), and by pollution.  
Gender norms in Tra 
Vinh  - Men  in middle age are usually farmers, workers, business  owners . Men  in 
young age are usually  compan y/factory  workers , and students .  
- Women  in middle age do small business es, and household  chore s such as 
cooking, cleaning, housekeeping. Women  in young age are students and  
company/factory workers , some do  online business.  
- Normally, women  are the ones to cook , tak e care of children and the 
elders . 
- Women  in middle and elder age go to temple s very often because they 
understand the culture  well and they have more time.  
- Land is owned by the husband in the family.  
- More young people migrate to work in other places  because they can get 
high er income/salary. There are not many jobs in the local areas .  
Cultural Value in Tra 
Vinh  
 Khmer festivals: Chol Chmam Thmay, Dol -ta, Oc -om-bok, Kathina.  
Khmer people have a different language from  Kinh people . In addition, 
Khmer people have more festival events.  
Ideas in making 
agriculture/  
aquaculture more 
attractive to youth 
and more sustainable 
and adaptable to 
climate change  Our idea : use food waste from agri -aquacultur al activit ies to make/produce 
compo st. In order to do that, we have to build strong knowledge on 
agriculture and biotechnology . 
Those who can  benefit  from this idea include  shrimp farmers and other 
farmers . 
Group 4  7 female students  
Names of group 
members  Anh Thu, Ngoc Mai, Tu Mui, Thu Hong, Huyen, Khoa  
Current problems in 
agriculture/  
aquaculture in Tra 
Vinh  
 Some  crops  grown by local farmers : rice, vegetable s. In these farming 
system s, the farmers need water, earth/soil, air resources to cultivate  the 
crops .  
In the context of climate change, local people  are face d with  saline water 
intrusion, increasing temperature, storm s etc .  
The current farming systems are not sustainable because the farmers use a 
lot of  chemicals  in farming , so the soil/earth, water and air resources are 
polluted.

Workshop on Gender and Climate Resilience and Adaptation for Khmer Youth   14 Gender norms in Tra 
Vinh  
 - Men  work as  construction worker s, drivers.  
- Women  work as  farm ers, garment workers.  
- In the family, women  do chore s such as ho usekeeping, cleaning, washing, 
cooking.   
- Men  own land in most cases .  
- Usually, e lder women  go to temple, they pray for “peace” for the family.  
- Many young people migrate to work in other places because they do not 
have stable jobs in the community.  
Cultural Value in Tra 
Vinh  Khmer festi vals: Chol Chmam Thmay,  Oc -om-bok 
Khmer people have different language, culture, and food to Kinh people .  
Ideas in making 
agriculture/aquacultu
re more attractive to 
youth and more 
sustainable and 
adaptable to climate 
change  Our team proposes an idea of  VAC system  (V= garden, A= pond, and C= 
animal pen ). These systems  can support each other. And this is very 
sustainable. In the garden, we can grow fruit s and vegetables. In the  pond, 
we can rais e fish. And in the  animal  pens , we can raise duck, chicken or 
even pig and cows.  
The benefit s will go to local farmers, especially small holder  farmers .

Workshop on Gender and Climate Resilience and Adaptation for Khmer Youth   15 Conclusions  
At the beg inning  of the workshop , the students were shy and  quiet , but as the sessions went on , and 
encouraged by the facilitators,  they became  more active in answering as well as raising questions to 
the presenters.  At the end, they became confident and actively engaged  in the group discussions and 
presentations . The students enjoyed the interactiv e format of the workshop  and found it 
informative,  interesting and meanin gful, and hoped for opportunities to participate in similar 
activities in the future.  
 
We believe that the participants  have  gained new  knowledge and awareness about climate change 
and the importance of gender and diversity.  They were  inspired by Ms. Chal Thi, the co-founder of 
SokFarm as this startup  has its  foundation in climate change resilience. We believe  that the 
workshop has positive impacts on the student s, and that  it can  help  change their future 
perspectives.

The Product Design Team from Rwanda was a multidisciplinary group representing various stages of the potato value chain. During this event, discussions centered on why market segmentation, the process followed during segmentation, variables to be considered while segmenting a market, and for a given market segment what process needs to be followed to develop a Target Product Profile. The team was introduced to the template to be used with an explanation for each of the terms in the template. Capabilities for Market Segmentation and Target Product Profile development bring focus to breeding programs, resulting in better outcomes. This is an important step towards designing varieties with impact.

It serves as (i) a breeding unit for BSF larvae as an alternative rich protein source in feed formulation for fish and chicken, (ii) source of BSF frass for vegetable production, and (iii) a learning center for interested farmers and the private sector in the Greater Ahafo Ano area. Following this, a 5-day intensive training on the Biology and Benefits of BSF, Mass Rearing Process of BSF, Housing and Farm Management practices of BSF, Post Processing of BSF Larvae, and Residue and Compost Production was conducted to build capacity of 4 farmers and 2 agricultural extension agents. The farmers were supplied with larvae and BSF kits as a startup, supported through continual supervision and technical backstopping provided to ensure optimal production under good hygienic conditions.

The Yam team (all disciplines included) in Benin was trained on why segmentation, the process followed during segmentation, variables to be considered while segmenting a market, and for a given market segment what process needs to be followed to develop a Target Product Profile. The training also focused on the template to be used with an explanation for each of the terms in the template. Capabilities for Market Segmentation and Target profile Development bring focus to breeding programs and is vital in guiding breeding decisions, resulting in breeding programs delivering higher returns on investment. During the process of product development, understanding gendered differences is at the center of the product design team dialogue.

The training addressed why market segmentation, the process of segmentation, variables to be considered while segmenting a market and for a given market segment, what process needs to be followed to develop a Target Product Profile. Attention was paid on the template for Target Product Profiles with an explanation for each of the terms in the template. Capabilities for Market Segmentation and Target profile Development bring focus to breeding programs and, is vital to guiding breeding decisions, resulting in breeding programs delivering higher returns on investment. During the process of product development, understanding gendered differences is at the center of the product design team dialogue.

The primary focus of the meeting was to engage the team on refining the Matooke market segment to better align it with Uganda's specific requirements. Furthermore, the meeting's outcome is to create a target product profile for the Matooke market segment in Uganda. This is also an important step in designing varieties for impact. During the process of product development, understanding gendered differences is at the center of the product design team dialogue.

Identifying the scarcity of high-quality seeds as a crucial issue, Transforming Agrifood Systems for South Asia (TAFSSA) introduced the Small Farmers Large Field (SFLF) concept, addressing both seed supply and agronomic support. The SFLF model ensures seed access by aggregating demand, negotiating with seed suppliers, and promoting market linkages, especially for vegetables and tuber crops. Tackling water scarcity,  TAFSSA employs a participatory approach to develop water-efficient agricultural systems, conserving groundwater and improving food security. Collaborating with Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society (JEEViKA), TAFSSA diversifies local diets through women-led initiatives.

Page 2:
Five types of myths1.Half-truths and doubtful statistics2.Women as saviors, survivors and natural caretakers3.Women as helpless victims4.False solutions5.‘All women…’
Page 3:
Page 4:
Problems:•Not backed by sound evidence•Perpetuate misconceptions when repeated•Block us from understanding the real issues•Complicated because often hold ‘a kernel of truth’Half-truths and doubtful statistics
Solutions:•Use authoritative, recent scientific sources•Local > Global•‘Sniff test’
Page 5:
Page 6:
Problems:•burdens women with undue responsibility without corresponding awards•savior/survivor myths stalls global climate response•perpetuates ‘caretaker’ stereotype•makes men invisibleWomen as saviors, survivors and natural caretakers
Solutions:•Place responsibility where due (not ‘only with the women’)•Portray diversity of women•Include men
Page 7:
Page 8:
Problems:-harmful stereotypes hold women back, misrepresent their contributions and roles-ignores women’s agency, their preferences and priorities -reinforces a narrative of women as passive actors who ‘need to be helped’-demeaning to womenWomen as helpless victims
Solutions:•Break the cycle: portray women as leaders, investors, business owners and more•Acknowledge structural inequalities: •women drown during cyclones because they cannot swim àwomen drown during cyclones because cyclone shelters are not safe for them•Uphold human dignity•Finkbeinertest: would you say the same thing about a man?
Page 9:
Page 10:
Problems:-Overly simplistic-Often places responsibility with the individual (not systemic causes)-Satiates need for solutions, hampers much-needed innovationFalse solutions
Solutions:•Dig deeper for real solutions that address structural causes•Real impact or window dressing?•Beware of the ‘magic fix’
Page 11:
Page 12:
Problems:•Not all women face the same inequalities; not all men have the same privileges•Greater gender equality and social inclusion àbetter outcomes for all (not only women)•Ignores role of men (again)•Ignores structural barriers (again)Focus on ‘all women’
Solutions:•Include different voices and experiences, their different risks and opportunities•Individuals > groups•Avoid generalizing

2 IRC Climate Resiliency – Anticipatory Action Pilot•Program : To reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies  and support  
households  to build  resilience  against  climate  shocks  by providing  climate  risk 
reduction  payments  and early  warning  messaging  to smallholder  farmers .
•Research : To assess  the effectiveness  of use of early  warning  systems  and 
anticipatory  cash  transfers  versus  post-shock  cash  transfers  to mitigate  the 
level of shock  and stress  experienced  by small  holder  farmers  in the event  of a 
hazardous  climatic  event
•Outcome : Households  reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies,  improve  
food security  and income  and build  resilience  to climatic  shocks .Project Goals

Hypothesis, experiment and study area
Hypothesis
When  climate  vulnerable  communities  have  timely  access  to information  and the financial  
and social  resources  to act upon  that information,  they will avoid  negative  coping  strategies,  
build  more  diversified  and climate  resilient  livelihoods .
Experiment
•Provision  of information  – early  warning  messages  (flood  alert,  disaster  risk/emergency  
preparedness,  disaster  management  and CSA)
•Transfer  of a lump  sum cash  (₦195,000 (~400USD)  to 725 flood -prone  HHs when  triggered  
by the climate  data risk thresholds,  and same  No. HHs (‘control  group’)  received  equal  
amount  of cash  post shock .
Study  area
•Fufore  LGA,  Adamawa
Page 5:
Key outcomes
Outcome1: 
Increase in climate 
adaptive actions 
Page 6:
Key results and implications
•Pre-shock  cash  payment  had significant  impacts  on:
•Household’s  rCSI and LCSI . HH less likely  to employ  negative  coping  strategies  in 
response  to the flood  shocks
•Labor  re-allocation  decisions  including  migration  of household  members . Generate  
additional  income  to meet  household  needs .
•Number  of pre-emptive  actions  households  took in anticipation  of flood  shocks .
•Long-term investment  decisions  on productive  agric . assets  and productive  livestock . 
This could  enhance  HH’s  future  income  generating  capacity  and reduce  their 
vulnerability  to future  shocks . Hence,  support  long-term resilience .
•No significant  difference  between  anticipatory  & post-shock  cash recipient  households  on 
FCS,  crop diversification,  mixed  crop-livestock  production,  and post-shock  actions  taken . 
Page 7:
Recommendations
•Given  the generally  positive  findings  on climate  resilience  capacity  and investment,  we 
suggest   humanitarian  agencies  and governments  to consider  anticipatory  interventions  
(such  as pre-shock  cash  transfers)  as a mechanism  for both meeting  basic  needs  (i.e., 
food consumption)  and improving  climate  resilience  of households . 
•As climate  shocks  continue  to worsen  and humanitarian  funding  needs  remain  unmet,  
anticipatory  interventions  may be critical  to meeting  the needs  of climate - and conflict -
affected  households .

2
•Conflict  remains  a major  driver  of poverty  in Africa   and conflicts  and political  
instabilities  have been increasing . 
•Explore  the relationship  between  violent  conflicts ; and farmers’  crop land; the share  of 
area planted  and harvested . 
•Implications  of conflict  on household’s  crop choices  and land allocation  decisions . 
•Explore  whether  conflict  shocks  influence  a shift from  high-investment  activities  to 
subsistence  activities .
•The relationship  between  violent  conflicts  and access  to community  services
Page 11:
www.cgiar.orgThe Data
•Geocoded  longitudinal  dataset  based  on an agricultural  survey  administered  in 
Nigeria  across  the three -wave  LSMS -ISA panel  survey . 
•Measured  conflicts  exposure  using  the number  of fatalities  associated  with incidents .
•Farmer’s  land allocation  was measured  using  the share  of area planted  in major  
crops  to total land area cultivated
•Based  on this measure,  we estimate  the effect  of violent  conflicts  on several  crop 
choice  and sales decisions . 
    
Page 12:
www.cgiar.orgKey Descriptive Findings
•Most  of the households  (70%) were  into cereals  production,  38% produced  legumes,  38% 
produced  roots,  while  very few (7%) produced  trees. 
•High  conflict  states : lower  percentage  of hired  labor  and lower  percentage  of purchase  of 
agricultural  inputs
•Land  area planted  with cereals  was higher  in high than in the low conflict  states .
•Area  covered  by roots  and trees is higher  in low than in high conflict  states . 
•HHs in low conflict  states  are more  likely  to engage  in wage  employment  & higher  market  
flexibility . 
Page 13:
www.cgiar.orgKey Empirical Findings
•Conflicts  reduced  land area dedicated  to longer -term crops  but increase  the share  of land 
area dedicated  to short -term crops  such as cereals . 
•Conflicts  reduced  the shares  of land area covered  with crops . Prolonged  conflict  may 
push HHs to exploit  a lower  % of their land for productive  activities
•Significantly  reduce  the shares  of agricultural  land harvested . 
•Conflicts  has a negative  significant  effect  on farmers  access  to market  and cooperatives .
•Negative  direct  effect  on investment  (area  planted,  area harvested)  and indirect  
(destruction  and disruption  of community  services)  
Page 14:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions
Violent conflicts affect land 
allocation patterns and cropping 
patterns, reducing land area 
allocated to longer -term crops 
such as trees and legumes that 
are amenable to longer -term soil 
management practices. 
Violent conflicts reduce market 
participation and hence induces 
production -oriented to satisfy 
own consumption.

Evaluation Questions
1.What is the productivity change gain for PBR cowpea compared to a conventional 
variety?
2.What is the effect of PBR cowpea on insecticide applications?
3.Does reduction in pesticide application translate to better health indicators for farmers 
and their families? 
4.Does the cultivation of PBR cowpea change household consumption of cowpea and/or 
increase cowpea surpluses? 
5.What are the heterogeneous impacts of PBR cowpea adoption by gender, age, and 
other household characteristics?

What is WEAGov ?
-WEAGov  – the Women’s Empowerment in Agrifood Governance 
tool – is an assessment framework to measure women’s voice in 
the agrifood policy process
-Developed by International Food Policy Research Institute 
(IFPRI) researchers and piloted in Nigeria by APRNet
-How can WEAGov  be used?
1.Measure women’s voice across different parts of the policy 
process
2.Identify entry points for raising women’s voice in different 
parts of the policy process
3.Track progress in women’s empowerment in agrifood policy 
process over time
Page 24:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
Page 25:

Women make up only 22%  of 
members of parliament

… and only 16%  of 
cabinet secretaries
Page 26:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
-Gender equality within agrifood systems is essential to meeting 
SDGs, yet it is difficult to measure and track
-There is a need to identify specific windows and opportunities to 
raise women’s voice in the agrifood policy process in order to 
achieve meaningful progress
Page 27:
WEAGov  covers 3 stages of the policy 
process
Agenda setting, 
Policy design, and 
Policy adoption 
Policy

reformAgenda setting, Policy design, 
and Policy adoption : 
•Why certain social and 
economic problems emerge 
as topics for policy debate
•How policy solutions are

•Which policy solutions are 
ultimately adopted
Policy implementation
•How policies are implemented 
in practice, including 
budgetary outlays, 
organizational strategies, and 
delivery of servicesPolicy evaluation & reform
•How policies are assessed 
against their objectives to 
know if changes are needed

How is WEAGov data collected? 
5 key measurement steps
▪Agrifood policy & stakeholder mapping → policy content analysis on gender 
integration and analysis of organizations involved in agrifood policy process
▪Desk review of objective, quantitative indicators of women’s empowerment in 
agrifood governance 
-e.g., # women ministers of agrifood agencies
▪Organization survey 
-Quantitative, objective data on staffing, gender strategies, gender activities of agrifood 
organizations
-Survey given to organizations involved in agrifood policy process – public sector (federal 
and state), private sector, and civil society organizations 
▪Expert survey 
-Perceptions and beliefs of key in -country stakeholders in the sector
-e.g., are opportunities for women’s participation well -known and utilized by key civil 
society actors  
-Survey given to leaders and experts in organizations in the agrifood policy process 
▪Technical panels or focus group discussions  
-Deliberate on measurement and validity with country experts

www.cgiar.orgIntroduction
•Government policies affect everyone, yet 
women are underrepresented in policymaking 
(Duflo 2012; Lawless 2015)
•Women’s participation in politics and civic life 
remains comparatively low (Iversen and 
Rosenbluth 2006)
•Reasons may include a lack of relevant skills and 
training, or norms that proscribe such behavior
•Worrisome as:
•Women’s unique policy needs may not be met if they lack voice and agency
•Women’s voice and agency in their community also help support women’s livelihoods

The Role of Spatial Inequalities on Youth Migration 
Decisions: Empirical Evidence from Nigeria
Mulubrhan Amare 
(with Kibrom A. Abay and Jordan Chamberlin )
Page 47:
www.cgiar.orgMotivation 
•The spatial  flow of labor  within  countries  responds  and contributes  to the geographical  
distribution  of economic  activity  and opportunity .
•Understanding  migration  decisions,  destination  and duration  helps  inform  our 
understanding  of the potential  outcomes  of alternative  regional  development  strategies . 
•How  different  types  of migrants  respond  to differences  in amenities,  resources,  and 
economic  activity,  to design  effective  policies  for migration,  
•Destination  perspective  to understanding  potential  pull factors  for various  forms  of 
migration
•Examine  how the attributes  of potential  destinations,  both in absolute  terms  as well as 
relative  to origins  of migration .
Page 48:
www.cgiar.orgObjectives
▪W e study youth migrants’ responses to observable characteristics of potential destinations 
and how these responses vary across various forms of migration.
▪Examine the role of observable attributes of potential destinations, both in absolute terms as 
well as relative to origin of migration.
▪Explore potential heterogeneity in the impacts of observable characteristics of potential 
destinations across various types of migrants. 
▪Understand pull factors of youth migration, a country characterized by relatively high rates 
of internal youth migration
▪Dyadic comparison of destinations and origins underscores the analytical importance of 
relative distributions of endowments.

•There are 3,140 youth migrants to each state. 
•Each of the migrants has chosen to move to one potential destination; and has therefore 
chosen not to move to the 36 remaining destinations. 
•Interested in explaining why each individual migrated to each actual destination and not to 
the remaining 36 states.

Destination choice of migrants by destination characteristics 
Page 51:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions and Implications 
•Migrants  respond  differently  to observable  characteristics  depending  on migration  pattern,  
duration,  and socioeconomic  status .
•Migrants  prefer  destinations  with higher  relative  welfare  and lower  cost of living .
•Rural -rural  migrants  are responsive  to agricultural  productivity  and land availability .
•Rural -urban  and urban -urban  youth  migrants  focus  on welfare  and urban  intensity .
•Permanent  migrants  prioritize  cost of living  but non-poor migrants  prioritize  welfare
•Policy  makers  can encourage  rural -rural  migration  by improving  agricultural  production  
potential  to reduce  youth  unemployment  and social  tensions  in urban  areas .

Experiments to accelerate 
adoption of improved 
varieties and quality seeds

Market Intelligence Initiative 
WP3 on Behavioral Intelligence team 
Page 53:
What drives farmers, consumers and private sector decisions to 
adopt new varieties and related products?
The problem: New varieties (even if the best ones) are 
often not adopted because of behavioral barriers and 
processes. Examples:
•Benefits from drought -tolerant varieties only 
experienced when there is a drought
•Improved nutritional value: Difficult to observe
With these barriers, how to accelerate varietal 
turnover?
Limited or unpredictable demand will limit private sector 
interest in promoting new varieties and related products.
•How to get private sector to promote new products?
Page 54:
Research Question 1 – How can we accelerate varietal turnover?Main Investment: A behavioral multi -country multi -crop randomized trial
•Six experiments (5 countries) 
•Coordinated experimental designs – common interventions
•Quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, and the same outcome variables.
•Nigeria: Baseline survey completed and seed trial minipack distribution started 
Sites and crops: 
•Nigeria: cowpea, maize
•Ethiopia: teff and wheat
•India: green gram, groundnut, rice
•Kenya: maize, beans, cowpea, green 
gram, sorghum
•Uganda: maize, sweet potato (2 sites)
Page 55:
Study site: Bauchi and Kaduna states, Nigeria 
Sample size: 2,016 households in 252 villages surveyed at baseline
Constraints to adoption of newer 
varieties: 
•Lack of information about new 
varieties
•Farmers are cautious to try out new 
varieties
•Lack of access to improved seeds
•Poor management practices
•Gender -based constraints
❖Women have low access to information, 
improved seeds, inputs, mobility
❖Women lack decision -making in varietal 
selection and farmingInterventions being

•Assess the associations between the quantity of  certified 
seeds produced and the spatial variations from where they 
are produced and,
•Spatial variations in the use of  certified seeds and/or 
improved varieties, yields, and output, and their relationship 
with agroclimatic and socioeconomic conditions

www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
4•Yield responses from certified seeds vary depending on the nature of  the farmland 
•When certified seeds are available, both yield and use increase. When it hits its peak, 
the effect of  the increase begins to diminish. 
•There are variations in the yields from certified seed which could be a result of  
climatic conditions and farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics.
•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
Page 64:
www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
5•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
•Farmers in close proximity to certified seed use it and improve their yields and 
outputs. This effect diminishes at the margin due to two factors
1.Yields from certified seeds vary considerably within each state, suggesting either 
quality issues in the supply chain or farmers not using complementary inputs or 
management practices when using quality seed.
2.As certified seed becomes more available to farmers, its use may spread from 
higher -return farms to lower -return farms, thereby diminishing the gains on the 
extensive margin.
Page 65:
www.cgiar.orgPolicy recommendations 
6•Revisit seed certification target in Nigeria
•Prioritize spatially the seed certification expansion effort if  it 
is still of  policy importance
•Promote more decentralized systems, like QDS / community 
seed schemes for rice, cowpeas, and OPV maize (as in various 
Eastern and Southern African countries)

Page 67:
Introduction to SAM
➢SAM  is a systematic  tool for economy -wide  analysis  and policy  prioritization,  used  to 
prioritize  the most  appropriate  investments  and suitable  policies  that can transform  the 
Nigerian  agricultural  food  market  and system .
➢SAM  is a national  accounting  framework  that captures  the circular  flow  of receipts  and 
payments  between  agents  and markets . 
➢SAM  provides  a complete  and consistent  dataset  of all economic  transactions  that takes  
place  within  the socio -economic  system .
➢Some  of the data  source  include : National  accounts  (NBS),  government  financial  statistics  
(Ministry  of Finance,  CBN),  Balance  of Payment  (IMF)  Household  expenditures,  and Labour  
Force  Surveys  etc.
Page 68:
Basic Structure of SAM
➢It sheds  light  on the activities  of the different  
economic  agents  by describing  the 
interrelationship  between  firms,  farms,  
households,  investors  and the external  sector .
➢The flow  of economic  activities  in monetary  terms  
from  expenditure/outflow  (col)  to income/inflow  
(row)
➢Activities  are domestic  firms  that  produce  goods  
and services  (commodities) . Factors  (labour , 
capital  and land)  are important  to produce  
activities . The activities  pay owners/suppliers  of 
factors  (households  – wages  and rents),  
government  (profits,  direct  tax),  and the rest of 
the world  (import,  debt  repayments)

Participants represented government organizations, private companies, producer associations, research centers, universities, and international cooperation organizations. Eleven national and international experts presented topics relevant to the pests 'Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia' (one of the possible causal agents of Punta Morada in Ecuador), Bactericera cockerelli (the potato psyllid), and 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (the causal agent of internal browning in potatoes). Presentations covered biology, ecology, economic importance, management, diagnosis, global and local situations in Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. Participants had the opportunity to observe field issues caused by Punta Morada in potatoes and other solanaceous plants, morphologically identify the psyllid, and engage in rapid diagnostic practices (LAMP), showing interest in applying this methodology in each country.

1. Introduc ción 
El complejo punta morada de la papa es uno de los principales problemas fitosanitarios que está 
afectando  al sistema de producción de papa en el norte de Perú . Actualmente  la PMP está asociada  a 
la presencia del psílido  de la papa B actericera cockerelli  (Mora et al., 2021; Pérez et al.,  2021)  un 
insecto polífago que afecta a solanáceas de importancia económica como la papa ( Solanum 
tuberosum ), el tomate ( Solanum lycopersicum ), la berenjena ( Solanum melongena), el tabaco 
(Nicotiana tabacum ) y otras solanáceas silvestres (CABI, 2022). El daño directo que causa el insecto se 
produce por la alimentación de las ninfas y adultos que, al succionar la savia, segregan toxinas que 
afectan a la planta. Además , las excretas que dejan en las hojas pueden dar origen al crecimiento de 
hongos saprófitos que limitan la capacidad fotosintética de la planta (CABI, 2022) . El daño indirecto  se 
produce al ser vector transmisor de  dos patógenos : dos tipos de fitoplasmas , Candidatus Phytoplasma 
aurentifolia (grupo 16SrII) (Caicedo et al., 2015) y otros fitoplasmas de los grupos 16SrI -F (Castillo et 
al., 2018) y 16SrXVIII (Castillo et al., 2022). Estos microorganismos son parásitos obligados localizados en el floema de la planta, parecidos a las bacterias y son transmitidos por insectos vectores.  (Caicedo 
et al., 2015; Ca stillo  et al ., 2018) y la bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter solanasearum (CLso)  causal d el 
manchado interno de los tubérculos o “ zebra chip (Munyaneza, 2012;  Pérez et al ., 2021 ; Caicedo  et 
al., 2020) .  Se estima que los daños causados por PMP pueden alcanzar pérdidas de hasta el 100% 
(Cuesta et al.,  2021)  siendo  uno de los principales problemas que afectan al cultivo de papa en Estados 
Unidos, México, Centroamérica, Nueva Zelanda y Ecuador (Cuesta et al., 2021) . Por lo tanto, el 
complejo punta morada se ha convertido en el problema fitosanitario de mayor importancia económica de la papa y otras solanáceas cultivadas, en los países donde han sido reportados y son considerados plagas cuarentenarias (Castillo &  Llumiquinga, 2021 ; Wenninger et al ., 2024). 
 La PMP producen síntomas similares en el follaje de la papa, incluyendo una decoloración  purpura y  
amarilla de los foliolos superiores, marchitez de las hojas, rizado apical de las hojas, tubérculos aéreos 
y senescencia precoz después de la floración, proliferación de yemas axilares, nudos hinchados, 
Page 7:
6 decoloración vascular y abarcamiento de las hojas (Sengoda et al., 2010; Pérez et al., 2021; Navarrete 
et al., 2023 ). El manchado interno produce una decoloración interna de color marrón en los tubérculos 
cuando se cortan y rayas oscuras cuando se fríen ( Munyaneza , 2012; Pérez et al., 2021 ; Wenninger et 
al., 2024).  
A nivel regional, el psílido de la papa Bactericera cockerelli ha sido reportado oficialmente en México, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Ecuador, Colombia y Perú (CABI, 2022 ; Wenninger et 
al., 2024); en tanto que el manchado interno ha sido reportado oficialmente en México, Honduras, 
Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador  y Ecuador.  
La PMP resurgió en Ecuador en los años 2012 -2013 en la provincia de Carchi. Dos brotes serios de la 
enfermedad ocurrieron en 2015 -2016 y en 2018 -2019 (Navarrete, et al., 202 3).  En 2019, las provincias 
de Imbabura y Cotopaxi tenían la mayoría de sus campos de papa (81% y 67% respectivamente) infestados con el psílido de la papa (Navarrete et al., 2023). En diciembre del 2021, el psílido de la 
papa fue reportada en el Perú por SENASA en la provincia de Huancabamba, departamento de Piura. 
Monitoreos conjuntos  realizados por el SENASA y el Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP) han 
encontrado la presencia del psílido en otras zonas como Tumbes y Cajamarca afectando papa y otras solanáceas como tomate, pepino  (Solanum muricatum ), ají ( Capsicum annuum) , pimiento  (Capsicum 
annuum
) y camote  (Ipomoea batata)  (Gamarra et al.,  2022) . En Colombia, el IICA reportó la presencia 
de B. cockerelli  en la zona de Nariño en abril del 2021 (IICA, 2021).  
Con base en estos antecedentes, y considerando el daño que puede causar B. cocker elli y la zebra chip 
a la industria de la papa de los países latinoamericanos, se desarrolló el presente taller internacional con el objetivo general de intercambiar trabajos y experiencias generadas en cuanto a la identificación, monitoreo y manejo integrado del complejo punta morada ( Bactericera cockerelli , fitoplasmas y CLso).   
Los objetivos específicos del taller fueron :  
• Compartir información sobre los avances alcanzados en el complejo PMP en papa y en otros 
cultivos de solanáceas entre los países latinoamericanos.  
• Capacitar a los técnicos asistentes al taller en la identificación del complejo punta morada y 
sus implicancias en otras solanáceas.  
• Formar alianzas estratégicas entre los países participantes y generar una hoja de ruta para la formulación de posibles proyectos para el manejo del complejo de punta morada.

La Agencia de Regulación y Control Fito y Zoosanitario, a través de la Coordinación General de Sanidad 
Vegetal, mediante el sistema de Vigilancia Fitosanitaria ha realizado el seguimiento mediante el 
monitoreo para la detección del psílido de la papa ( Bactericera cockerelli), punta morada y Candidatus  
Liberibacter solanacearum. La  Agencia juntamente con  el Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones 
Agropecuarias (INIAP), se dio seguimiento a partir de los brotes detectados en la provincia de Carchi 
en el 2014, t erritorio en el que,  mediante campañas de manejo como uso de semilla sana, eliminación 
de cultivos abandonados, evitar la movilidad de semilla de zonas afectadas, se redujo su presencia. Sin embargo, la movilidad del insecto en restos de material vegetal, semilla contaminada se dispersó 
a las zonas cercanas de producción, los primeros reportes en la provincia de Pichincha fueron en 2017, a partir de ese año, la movilidad de semilla afectada, la falta de medidas de bioseguridad permitió que 
la plaga se disemine por el callejón interandino llegando hasta la provincia de Loja en el año 2021. El 
monitoreo por parte de la Agencia se ha realizado de forma ininterrumpida a nivel de las zonas productoras a fin de establecer su distribución, incidencia y severidad, en todas las zonas de producción de solanáceas como son Carchi, Imbabura, Pichincha, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, Bolívar, 
Tungurahua, Cañar, Azuay y Loja, además se reportó los primeros reportes de Candidatus  Liberibacter 
solanacearum (Clso) en las provincias de Carchi, Pichincha, Cotopaxi y Chimborazo desde el 2020.  
Page 9:
8 A partir del aparecimiento de estos problemas la Agencia realiza el muestreo de semilla certificada 
por INIAP, con el propósito de comercializar semilla libre de punta morada y Clso.  Actualmente, de los 
resultados obtenidos de las prospecciones realizadas se ha evidenciado la presencia de síntomas de punta morada y Clso en cultivos como uvilla ( Physalis peruviana) , tomate de árbol ( Solanum 
betaceum ), pimiento y ají.

Los factores que afectan la incidencia del psílido de la papa ( Bactericera cockerelli ) y la punta morada 
en centros de origen y diversificación de solanáceas se desconocen. Así, esta investigación buscó responder ¿Cómo el año, la altitud y porcentaje de solanáceas en el Ecuador afectan a la incidencia del psílido y la punta morada? Para ello, se creó una base de datos que contenía información de incidencia del psílido (n = 951 campos monitoreados), fecha de vigilancia sanitaria, altitud de los campos, y el porcentaje de solanáceas por parroquia en los mismos años de vigilancia. La misma base 
de datos se construyó para la incidencia de punta morada (n = 248 campos monitoreados). Se 
realizaron análisis de regresión logística para identificar la influencia del año de recolección de datos, 
la altitud de los campos y el porcentaje de solanáceas por parroquia en la incidencia del psílido y la punta morada. Los resultados indicaron que la presencia del psílido se ve afectada por la interacción entre el año, la altitud de los campos y el porcentaje de solanáceas por parroquia. Por ejemplo, se observó que a mayores altitudes existe una mayor probabilidad de encontrar campos con baja incidencia del psílido, aunque varió por año. Posiblemente debido a las preferencias del psílido por otros hospederos en el paisaje y los cambios en el paisaje agrícola. Los modelos también mostraron que el promedio de psílidos por parroquia y el porcentaje de solanáceas influyen en el nivel de incidencia de punta morada. A mayor presencia de psílidos, aumenta la probabilidad de encontrar campos con mayor incidencia de punta morada. Además, se encontró que a mayor presencia de 
solanáceas cultivables en el paisaje, hay una mayor probabilidad de encontrar campos con baja 
incidencia de punta mor ada. Estos resultados muestran la importancia de los diferentes factores 
temporales y agroecológicos en la diseminación del psílido y la punta morada.  
 
Identificación morfológica y molecular del psílido de la papa

Morfológicamente, a Bactericera cockerelli  se lo identifica por la presencia de tres bandas blancas  en 
el abdomen, observables a simple vista. La primera banda se localiza en el primer segmento abdominal. La segunda banda se encuentra a lo largo del abdomen, y la tercera en el último segmento abdominal en forma de “V” invertida. Además, posee varias líneas blancas con un patrón definido en la cabeza y 
tórax  que se las observa con lentes de aumento ( Figura 1). 
Las siguientes características son importantes para diferenciar a B. cockerelli  de otras especies de 
psílidos. La venación del ala anterior es clave para la identificación  (Figura 2). La vena R+M+Cu 
presenta una trifurcación cerca de la base del ala, característica de las especies de la familia Triozidae. La vena M se bifurca en la parte distal y el vértice del ala queda dentro de la bifurcación. Posee tres 
marcas en el borde inferior del ala que están dentro de las celdas formadas por las nervaduras. Las 
alas son trasparentes. El anillo rhinarium se encuentra en el cuarto segmento antenal. La terminalia de la hembra es corta y en forma de cuña. El proctíger del macho tiene lóbulos posteriores triangulares. 
Page 10:
  
 
 
9 Los parameres son lamelares con una punta apical esclerotizada.Es importante observar el 
comportamiento de los adultos en las plantas ya que tienden a saltar cuando son molestados, de ahí 
su nombre común de piojo saltarín de las plantas. De esta manera se los puede diferenciar de otros 
insectos como dípteros o pulgones. Una forma indirecta de identificar la presencia de los psílidos en 
el campo es observar los residuos de sus excrementos que se solidifican y quedan sobre las hojas de las plantas hospederas,  como pequeñas partículas blancas, de esto se deriva su otro nombre común 
que es salerillo (Figura 3). En el campo, el observar las oviposturas amarillas/anaranjadas (semejantes a un grano de polen) puede ser más fácil para detectar la presencia del insect o en las plantas (Figura 
4). La identificación molecular se basa los protocolos de Crosslin et al. , 2011 y 2013, y en Swisher et 
al., 2012.

Se tomaron muestras  sintomáticas  de cultivos de papa, tomate de árbol, uvilla, naranjilla, pimiento y 
ají de Carchi, Imbabura, Pichincha y Cotopaxi  para la detección de los agentes causales de PMP: 
fitoplasmas y CLso . Para la detección de estos agentes causales se realizó una extracción de ADN, 
luego amplificó el ADN mediante PCR anidada para fitoplasmas y PCR punto final para CLso.  
Se extrajo el ADN de nervaduras de hojas, tubérculos aéreos y brotes de tubérculos semilla (papa) y semillas sexuales (tomate de árbol) y de psílidos asociados a estos cultivos. Las extracciones de ADN se realizaron con protocolos de Frost (2011) y Morillo  y Miño (20 02). Además,  se utilizaron tres kits 
comerciales.  
Las amplificaciones para fitoplasmas se realizaron mediante PCR anidada para los ADN aislados de papa, tomate de árbol y naranjilla con los marcadores R16F2n y R16R2 seguido de fU5 y rU3 ( G. 
Gliacaglia, comunicación personal., Gundersen et al 1996; Lorenz et al 1995). En ambos casos no existió amplificaciones positivas con los ADN extraídos , solamente con cuatro controles positivos de 
fitoplasma de papa provenientes de investigaciones internacionales.Para CLso, se realizó PCR punto final con los tres sets d e marcadores del gen ribosomal 16S (OA2 y OI2c; CLIPO y OI2c; LSOF y OI2c) y 
proteínas ribosomales (rpIJ y rpIL). Se obtuvo amplificaciones positivas para los cultivos evaluados, con diferentes frecuencias de detección que pudieron variar según la distribu ción del patógeno en la 
planta. En papa, se obtuvieron resultados positivos provenientes de diferentes partes de las plantas, así como del vector; pero los más consistentes fueron los ADN de tubérculo de papa e insectos.   
Al observar que los protocolos de PCR son consistentes respecto a las amplificaciones de controles 
positivos para fitoplasmas y CLso, se considera evaluar y/o mejorar protocolos de extracción de ADN , 
así como , las estrategias de muestreo de las plantas afectadas por estos patógenos.

En Ecuador, el complejo PMP , es una de las principales enfermedades que afecta a los cultivos de papa 
desde el 2013 . El avance de esta enfermedad fue muy rápido, ya que , hasta el año 2020  cubrió toda 
la zona papera del país, que se ubica en la región serrana del país . 
Los agentes  causales  reportados en Ecuador son: Fitoplasmas de los grupos 16Srll, 16Srl- F y 16SrXVIII 
que son transmitidos por insectos  vectores ( cicadélidos, saltones de hoja). Otro agente causal del es 
la bacteria Candidatus  Liberibacter solanacearum o CaLso, conocido como “papa manchada”, “papa 
rayada” o “zebra chip”, cuyo vector es el psílido Bactericera cockerelli  
El complejo PMP, puede afectar  a todas  las variedades  de papa , tanto mejoradas  como  nativas . Los 
efectos que causa son variados:  reduce la producción , puede ocasionar  pérdidas  económicas del 50 -
100%, ha propiciado  el uso indiscriminado agroquímicos; incrementado los  costos de producción; ha 
generado  impacto ambiental negativo .  Los peores efectos son causados cuando los agricultores  
abandonan los  lotes contaminados e infestados, ya que estos lotes se transforman  en criaderos del  
psílido.  
Es importante mencionar que esta enfermedad afecta a otros cultivos  de solanáceas como : tomate, 
uvilla, pimiento,  tomate de árbol.  Los síntomas en las plantas pueden ser:  achaparramiento o 
enanismo, tallos y ramas elongadas, hojas encrespadas, enrollamiento de hojas, hojas amarillentas y 
moradas, tallos en zigzag, entrenudos cortos y engrosados, filodias en estructuras florales, tubérculos aéreos y muerte temprana de la plan ta. Estos síntomas aparecen de dos a tres  semanas posteriores a 
Page 13:
12 la transmisión . El síntoma en los tubérculos  en el pardeamiento  vascular ; también,  al freír se puede 
observar  manchas rayadas  en las hojuelas , así mismo al cocinar los tubérculos pueden tener un  sabor 
“dulzón ” o se pueden presentar partes cristalizadas o endurecidas.  Los tubérculos para semilla pueden 
presentar  brotes  ahilados, o en otros casos, lo tubérculos no brotan.  
El INIAP propuso una estrategia de manejo cuyos componentes son: genético, cultural, químico, 
biológico y legal. El objetivo del m anejo integrado  del complejo de punta morada de la papa (MI– CPMP ) 
es disminuir la diseminación de la enfermedad con semilla enferma; así como manejar/controlar al 
vector para disminuir la transmisión de la enfermedad.   
Los principios del MI- CPMP son:  
1) Semilla sana: usar semilla certificada, o de procedencia conocida. Se recomienda utilizar 
variedades precoces ( -120 días) o semitardías ( -150 días) . 
2) Detección y monitoreo del insecto vector.  Detección en trampas para determinar la 
presencia y cuantificar la población de adultos. Monitoreo en plantas para cuantificar las 
poblaciones en sus diversos estados: ninfas, huevos y adultos. Esta actividad debe realizarse semanalmente.  
3) Prácticas culturales:  preparación adecuada del suelo, aumento de la distancia de siembra 
entre surcos, fertilización balanceada y fraccionada, control de malezas, eliminación de plantas enfermas, defoliación precosecha y rotación de cultivos.  
4) Control químico al vector: al detectar la presencia de adultos se debe realizar una 
intervención inmediata. Se deben rotar insecticidas en función de su grupo químico, modo y mecanismo de acción; considerando el estado insecto y la fase de cultivo. El uso de agroquímicos segun  las dosis, mezclas y cantidad agua recomendadas por los fabricantes. Las 
aplicaciones de agroquímicos deben realizarse con equipos calibrados, presión (nebulización). 
Las aplicaciones deben  dirigirse  al envés de hojas medias y bajas, que es el lugar donde se 
encuentran preferentemente los insectos. Es importante la consulta y guía para la aplicación 
de esta estrategia.  
Para enfrenar el problema del CPMP, el INIAP implementó algunas acciones como: La creación de un 
comité técnico interno permanente, un comité interinstitucional a nivel nacional, así como el 
desarrollo de proyectos y  actividades de investigación básica, aplicada y adaptativa. Así mismo s e 
implementó una estrategia de manejo de la enfermedad en los procesos de producción de semillas de categorías altas. Realizó un fuerte proceso de capacitación a técnicos, productores, estudiantes a 
nivel nacional. Además , regularizó  algunas publicaciones técnicas y científicas.

Para reducir los efectos de la introducción y dispersión de zebra chip ( Candidatus  Liberibacter 
solanacearum) y el psílido de la papa ( Bactericera cockerelli ), plagas de importancia en papa y otras 
solanáceas, en Perú se han venido implementando la vigilancia fitosanitaria específica, control, capacitaciones e investigaciones.  
Desde el 2019, el SENASA ejecuta la vigilancia específica de B. cockerelli en Tumbes, Piura, Cajamarca, 
Amazonas, La Libertad y Lambayeque, realizándose prospección de detección mediante trampas 
amarillas pegantes y la inspección visual de plantas. En octubre 2021, en la provincia de Huancabamba, Piura se detectó al insecto en el cultivo de papa y capulí cimarrón ( Nicandra physalodes ); 
Page 14:
  
  
13 posteriormente, mediante capturas en trampas amarillas pegantes, instaladas en predios de  
solanáceas  fue report ado la presencia del insecto  en Tumbes y Cajamarca. 
La vigilancia específica de zebra chip, se viene realizando en los departamentos antes señalados, descartándose su presencia desde muestras de hojas y tubérculos de papa y adultos de B. cockerelli . 
A nivel de país, B. cockerelli  tiene la condición de plaga presente bajo control oficial; en Huancabamba, 
plaga establecida; en Tumbes y Cajamarca, posterior a las primeras detecciones y medidas de control implementadas, no se tienen nuevas detecciones. Zebra chip mantiene la condición  de plaga 
cuarentenaria ausente.  
Además de vigilancia, el SENASA ha venido capacitando a su personal y a los productores, realiza comisos y destrucción de hospedantes en frontera, implementa acciones de control en predios infestadas, ejecuta actividades de investigación en manejo integrad o y control biológico. Se han 
realizado acciones de capacitación e investigación junto con el CIP, el gobierno regional de Piura y/o el INIA.

The Nature-Positive Solutions initiative aims to promote sustainable agricultural practices among small and medium farmers. One crucial aspect of this initiative is the effective management of agro-waste through resource recovery and reuse. Based on scoping studies and stakeholder engagements, lack of awareness about circular bioeconomy solutions is one of the major gaps in adoption of these solutions. To address this, based on training need assessments and in collaboration with national partners, training of trainers (ToTs), practical capacity building workshops are organized in the different target countries involving women, youth, farmers, informal businesses and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in target countries.

 PART ONE:  INTRODUCTION  
 
1. TRAINING OVER VIEW  
 
The TRANSFO RM Work Package team and the AgWise team of the Excellence in Agronomy (EiA)  
Initiative of One  CGIAR organized a 3-day training course for Use Case teams and their demand 
partners to enhance  their knowledge on EiA data management tools and especially AgWise.  
The course was held at the Mercure  Hotel  and Residence , Nairobi, Kenya  from 1st to 3rd November 
2023 . The training was als o broadcast  online to allow participation of people who were not able to 
travel , with 3 -4 participants attending online  each day .  
Specifically, the course aimed  to equip participants with:  
• Knowledge of the AgWise decision support framework and how Use Cases could engage 
with it , 
• An u nderstanding of EiA data management tool s and solutions, including how and what was 
needed to use them,  
• An understanding of protocols and SoPs for Use Cases to consistently validate and assess 
performance of their MVPs in the field,  
• An overview of Human -Centered Design, including its importance in the work Use Cases do,  
• Possibilities for Use Cases to disseminate and sustain their products more effectively . 
Agronomic decision -making and evidence -driven advisories require high -quality data from field  trials 
and experiments . These data  need to be in tegrated and combined with other sources for input to 
analytical models and decision support tools to improve predictive capacity and generate improved 
management options that enhance crop productivity and agronomic gains. Collaborative efforts and 
data sharing across stakeholders generate insights by leveraging data pools including location -
specific and multivariate data sources.  
However , for this to happen, data must be  shared and conform  to the same commu nity-agreed 
standards . This enables  reuse across the data life cycle and accelerates  innovation , and the ability to 
derive  insig hts. It allows easier and faster development of management options for stakeholders , 
includ ing the ultimate beneficiaries – who are often poor farmers.   
EiA aims at developing and delivering locally relevant and demand -driven agronomic solutions at 
scale based increasingly on standardized data . Demand is  formulated and operationalized around 
Use Cases  that develop  Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) . Development of such MVPs requires data

 collected data adhere s to the FAIR Principles1 and can be easily found and reused from  a global  
agronomy database.  TRANSFORM also houses the AgWise generalized decision support framework, 
allowing the development of fertilizer, planting date and other recommendations for farmers. Use 
Case MVP efforts both contribute to and use AgWise routines. Further, the Work Package has 
developed field validation protocols to support  Use Cases consistently and robustly assess 
performance of the MVPs they develop . 
This training focused on  build ing awareness about  the data management tools available to Use 
Cases , current advances in the  AgWise  decision support framework, validation protocols, MVP 
dissemination and sustainability, and the importance of Human Centered Design in Use Case MVP 
development.

 PART TWO : TRAINING DESCRIPTION  
 
1. TRAINING  CONTENT  AND METHODOLOGY  
 
The training  was dedicated to interactions with Use Cases focusing  on the tools, protocols, 
analytical/predictive solutions, and general support offered by the  TRANSFORM  Work P ackage , and 
on addressing Use Case challenges.  
 
The first day w as focused on the  AgWise  decision support fram ework:  learning what it is, how it can 
help Use Cases and what are the minimum requirements in terms of data to use it.  AKILIMO  was also 
presented as a success story and precursor of AgWise.  
 
The second day w as about dissemination and sustainability  of tools and products developed by the 
Use Cases. Partners like Ignitia , the AKILIMO Association  and Digital Green shared thoughts on 
effective  product  dissemination and sustainability. Exercises in small groups  allow ed partic ipants to 
reflect on  the challenges and gaps related to MVP dissemination and sustainability  their Use Case. A 
session w as also dedicated to explaining  what Human Centered  Design  is and how to include it in the 
development of the MVP.  
 
The last day w as dedicated to data management tools supported by EiA: DataScribe , AgroFIMS , 
FAIRscribe , ONA , and the agronomy database, or DataPool . These tools allow Use Cases to improve 
data collection, and the standardized  data collected renders it easy  for TRANSFORM  developers to 
create  the impact dashboard . 
 
The last  session describ ed the field v alidation exercises  that each Use Ca se employs  to assess MVP 
performance , and the tools designed by TRANSFORM  Work Package  to support Use Cases in this .  
 
The training  agenda  is available  in Annex  2. 
 
The training includ ed a variety of learning t echniques from  lectures  (Figure 2 ), individual and team 
reflection  exercise s (Figure 3), feedback on experience from external partners, quizzes , question  and 
answer , and plenary discussions.  Most exercise s were reported  online  via shared docu ment s by 
participants  to allow engagement  of both on-site and onlin e participants .

 2. EXERCISE  RESULTS  
 
2.1. AgWise 
On the first day, after a detailed  presentation  of AgWise  and its use , each Use Case  team  listed the 
opportunities  and gaps that A gWise  coul d help  overcom e. The results are available here: 
EiA_UC_DSTs_gaps_2023 -11-01.docx . 
 
2.2. Minimum Viable Product  Dissemination  
On day 2, Use Case team s were ta sked to a group exercise to reflect on the  dissemination -related 
gaps  and challenges on their Use Case . 
  
The resul ts show that the main dissemination partners of all EiA Use Cases are private organizations 
such as fertilizers suppliers, OLAM, Digital Green,  or RAB. Some  Use Cases also partner with public 
organizations like the national extension services (Ethio pia), government agencies (Cambodia and 
Vietnam), University (Planting S outh Asia) and farmers cooperatives.   
  
All Use Cases plan to use digital dissemination tools. Six Use Cases will use a Chatbot , 7 will employ  
SMS, 6 will design a mobile application, 6 will use social media, 4 will develop  an API, others will 
have IVR (3), a website (2), video (1), dashboard  (1). Among the Use Case s who use analog tools, 4 
will use a lookup table, and 9 will use printed documents (guide, banner,  or map ) (Table ). 
 
The main dissemination -related gaps  that Use Cases face are: improving  their MVP, inclu ding  social 
sciences in their work and scaling their MVP.  
 
The main dissemination -related challenges  (defined as  actions Use Cases  are taking  but could 
improve ) were articulated as : improv ing their MVP, the fact that the MVP does not respond  to 
targeted users, and the lack of funds.   
 
Inputs  from Use C ases can be found here : EiA_UC_Dissemination_GapsChallenges_2023 -11-02.docx  
 
2.3. Minimum Viable Product  Sustainability  
The next exercise  was for the Use Case team s to reflect on the top 2 -4 longer -term (post -
project/initiative) sustainability -related  gaps and challenges  for their  Use Case . 
  
The report fro m the team s show s that a ll Use Cases present in the workshop have a sustainability 
model that is budget dependen t (except for  the GAIP Ghana  Use Case ). 
 
The major sustainability -related challenges Use Cases face are: lack of funding, keeping private 
partners engaged, developing a  business model  and lack of training for staff or end users.  
 
The main sustainability -related gaps Use Cases deal with  are: government  involvement , capacity of 
end users and staff, developing strong partnership s, and improving their MVP s.

2.4. Human Centered Design  (HCD)  
The principles of Human Centered Design were presented to particip ants prior to an exerc ise where 
Use C ase teams had to reflect on the questions  below : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The inputs from Use Cases can be found here:  EiA_UC_HumanCenteredDesign _Exercise  
 
After the session, Anna Mueller , Human Center Design expert , provided the synopsis  below:  
➢ Use Cases address a variety of direct and indirect users. Most Use Cases have their users not 
clearly profiled and target very generic direct and indirect  user s.  
➢ Use Cases deal with a variety of stakeholders and indirect users that pose different demands 
on the design of the  solutio n.   
 
 
 • Who engages with your solution and who has an interest in your solution? 
Who are your users? Think particularly about your stakeholders.  
• What are your excitements and worries when you think about using  HCD in 
your Use Case / country acti vities?  
• What are your current barriers and pain points for learning from users and 
integrating these insights into the design of your solution?

 Current  barriers to learning from users and 
stakeholders and integrating their insights 
into the design of  the MVP i nclude : 
 
• No or little  capacit y and resources  within the 
team to generate user insights and translate 
them into design decisions, this includes 
availability (or knowledge of)  tools. 
• Accessing users  is difficult .  
• Time pressure  to deliver results hinde rs 
iterative and user focused  approac h.  
• Power dynamics  within the use cases (whose 
voice is heard and considered in the design )  
 Areas of excitement about HCD in relation to 
your Use Case : 
 
• Enhanced user understanding and tailoring 
solutions : HCD enables a deeper 
understanding of user needs and preferences, 
allowing for the development of tailored 
solutions that are more likely to be adopted 
and used effectively .  
• Improved chances of scaling impact : HCD 
helps to ensure that solutions are designed 
for sca lability, allowing for broader reach and 
greater impact across a wider user base .  
• Continuous improvement and iterative 
process : HCD  promotes a continuous learnin g 
allowing for the identification of potential 
bottlenecks and the ongoing refinement of 
solutions based on user feedback .  
Top concerns about HCD in your Use Case : 
 
• Balancing HCD principles with competing 
priorities and existing systems : HCD may 
need to be carefully integrated with existing 
systems and priorities, particularly in 
scenarios where government policies or 
timelines may not fully align with HCD 
principles .  
• Addressing the diversity of user needs and 
contexts : HCD needs to effectively account 
for the diverse needs, preferences, and 
contexts of different user groups, particularly 
in a region like Latin America where 
agricultural practices and cultural norms vary 
across countries and regions .  
• Resource constraints and limited scalability : 
HCD may  requir e additiona l resources,  
expertis e, and time investment, which could  
impac t the overall feasibility of implementing 
HCD in resource -constrained settings. 
Additionally, scaling HCD solutions to a wider 
audienc e may pose challenges, especially if 
these solutions need to be adapted to local 
languages and context s. roundtable 
discussions to  identif y and address  common 
challenge s and opportunities in HCD 
implementation .  To a pply HCD Use Case  teams  miss : 
 
• Effective stakeholder engagement : Identif y 
and engage  appropriate partner s who can 
connect with the target user  groups an d 
collaborate with sociologists to gain deeper 
insights into user be havior, motivations, and 
cultural contexts .  
• Streamlined HCD processes : Develop 
standardized feedback collection methods, 
simplify existing HCD formats, and create a 
comprehensive playbook or set of guideline s 
to provid e a step -by-step framework for HCD 
implementatio n in EiA.   
• Proactiv e HCD integration : Deliberately 
incorporate HCD as an integral part of project 
planning and implementation, incorporate 
HCD into budgeting, and design and budget 
for the HCD process .  
• HCD training and support : Provid e capacit y 
building for team members through training 
and development  programs, an d organize 
regional training programs to disseminate 
HCD knowledge and practices among partners 
and stakeholders . 
• Continuous feedback loops : Establis h a 
mechanism for regularly sharing user 
feedback and insights .

 2.5. Data management  tools in EiA  
 
During day 3, the different  data mana gement tools  available through  the TRANSFO RM Work Package 
were presented . After the presentation , Use Cases s hared their interest  in tools that may help them 
in MVP development . 
Use Cases are interested in using the following EiA data management tools, in order of importance : 
DataScribe, ONA, FAIR scribe, Carob, AgroFIMS and the DataPool  (Table 3Error! Reference source not 
found. ).  
Use cases are interested in using EiA data management tools to better standardize their data, to 
easily aggregate data, and acc ess to data monitoring tools.    
The actions that TRANSFORM could take to improve data management within the Use Case s are: 
building more  capacity and awareness on the tools available, ensuring data  quality , developing 
incentive s to share data, provid ing better access to data and develop ing guidelines on data sharing 
at the CGIAR level.

3. GRAPHIC  NOTES  
 
A graphic designer assisted  throughout the training  to capture  information  and lessons learn ed in 
highly graphic format . These visual notes  are a powerful  tool to summarize t he training  content. The 
3 figures (Figs 4, 5, 6) could  be seen as a single panoramic figure  were participants  start  their 
learning journey in a dry land and end in a green landscape  thank s to the knowledge  and tools 
(represented by  the back pack)  they have  accumulated  during the training .

 PART THREE:  TRAINING  EVALUATION  
 
1. Evaluation of participant  progress  
 
A quiz was given to participants  before the tools were presented and again after , to assess lessons  
learned by participants . The questions were different on th e 2 quizzes . Mentime ter wa s used to 
ensure private responses and encourage participation  and fun. Table 4 below present s the summary 
of the results.  The detailed  results are available here: EiA_TR_AgWise_UC_workshop  
Table 4: Quiz r esults regarding  knowle dge of tools . 
Knowledge   
of % of good answer   
Start of training  End of training  Progress  
AgWise  Not asked  67%  / 
DataScribe  60%  65%  5% 
AgroFIMS  44%  73%  29%  
ONA  47%  84%  37%  
FAIRscribe  36%  38%  2% 
DataPool  43%  21%  -22%  
Carob  64%  76%  12%  
  
Participants  increased their knowledge of all EiA tools  during this  traini ng. The table seemingly 
indic ates  a decrease  of knowledge  for the DataPool. However, t his result  is du e to the complexity of 
the “after” question , which quizzed participants  on the difference between  a database and a 
repository  (Figure 7). Participants  knew the purpose of the DataPool but did not remember the 
definitions of a r epository  vs a database .

 2. Lessons  learn ed for trainers  
 
The training provided an invaluable chance  for the organizers  to take  home some learning s: 
• Ask participants  to share their exercise results  in an online document : This allow s 
participants  to share their  thoughts  in detail and  make s it easy for organizer s to gather 
feedback .  
• Quizzes keep participants engaged and are a good way to evaluate knowledge.  
• Few Use Case leads were aware of EiA tools and what each of them can provide. One 
solution could be to s hare a written description of the tools at EiA level (on EiA website) . 
 
3. Conclusion s 
 
In con clusion, t he training was a success  as it brough t Use Case  members  to know about the tool s 
available  in EiA  to help them manage data , and to reflect on the dissemination  and sustainable  
challenges  they are facing as well as  know ing about Human Center Design principles.

 What are EiA’s aspirations, particularly those  relating to data and 
analytics ? 
Overall objective of EiA:  EiA aims to deliver  an increase in productivity  and quality per unit of input 
(agronomic gain) for millions of smallholder farming households in prioritized farming systems by 2030.   
The TRANSFORM Work Package  
deals with data & analytics to  
help achieve this objective .  
 
 
 
TRANSFORM’s data and analytics outcome:  At least 20 research and scaling partners use and share 
common, open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and r euseable) data, tools and analytics to 
support the co -creation of locally relevant agronomic solutions integrating climate -smart, inclusivity and 
sustainability dimensions and assessing their performance using standardized protocols.   
The TRANSFORM Work Package houses technical  experts to  help Use Case teams and other EiA activities 
with data management,  analytics and  decision  support. TRANSFORM has developed data management 
tools and analytical solutions to help achieve EiA goals – including commitment to BMG F regarding  Open 
and FAIR data.   
What are the expectations re gardin g EiA’s Use Case s concerning data?  
1. Sign the Data Sharing Agreement  and adhere to its terms and condition  
2. Use EiA questionnaires , surveys and protocols for key data collection stages  (e.g., validation, 
piloting, MELIA)  and activities (e.g., add -on survey ), changing only what is essential to reflect the 
nature and focus of the Use Case . 
3. Collect data that is FAIR1 and make old datasets FAIR  in conform ance with  accepted  standards  
(also per CGIAR Open and FAIR Data Assets Policy2). There are several tools available to do this – 
open to all – and the default should be that these are used.

 4. Use ONA – EiA’s data management system – OR – ensure that Use Case’s data management 
systems provide data to TRANSFORM.   
5. Make data open  (also per CGIAR Open and FAIR Data Assets Policy) : Upload cleaned, processed 
data in near real -time to EiA ’s agronomy  database . NOTE: If another database is in use, it must 
have an API and EiA must be able to  pull data into the EiA database in near real -time.  
6. Help test tools, provide feedback on if and how they could be improved.  
7. standardized protocols, trial designs (e.g., for MVP Follow validation).  
Why must I live up to these expectations?   
1. Our funders expect Open and FAIR data, available in near -real time.  
2. We need to comply with CGIAR’s public goods mandates, its Open and FAIR Data Assets Policy, 
and increasing calls for Open Science.   
3. There is a moral imperative to find rapid, reliable solutions for pressing global agricultural 
challenges – and these rely on Open and FAIR data.  
4. The need for high -quality Open and FAIR data, particularly from developing countries, is 
particularly urgent with the increasing interest in and applications of Artificial Intelligence in 
agriculture. Lack of data from appropriate agroecologies can result in analytical bias and 
inaccurate results.  
 
 
 
 
 
Keeping d ata to yourself  might allow you to publish 
a few papers for personal advancement – but 
publishing Open and FAIR data (as a data paper and 
in an open database) will enable analysis over large 
data aggregations and allow accelerated research 
and deeper, broader insights .

What exactly is Open and FAIR data?  
Open Data : Data assets  can be freely  used,  reused  (modified) and redistributed (shared) by  anyone.  
FAIR data:  Data assets that are  Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable , as defined in Fig. 1 . 
Data that are fully findable and accessible (downloadable by all) are fully open...BU T not all open data are 
fully interoperable or reusable.  EiA and BMGF stipulate data must be Open AND FAIR  to accelerate 
research & innovation.

2 IRC Climate Resiliency – Anticipatory Action Pilot•Program : To reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies  and support  
households  to build  resilience  against  climate  shocks  by providing  climate  risk 
reduction  payments  and early  warning  messaging  to smallholder  farmers .
•Research : To assess  the effectiveness  of use of early  warning  systems  and 
anticipatory  cash  transfers  versus  post-shock  cash  transfers  to mitigate  the 
level of shock  and stress  experienced  by small  holder  farmers  in the event  of a 
hazardous  climatic  event
•Outcome : Households  reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies,  improve  
food security  and income  and build  resilience  to climatic  shocks .Project Goals

Hypothesis, experiment and study area
Hypothesis
When  climate  vulnerable  communities  have  timely  access  to information  and the financial  
and social  resources  to act upon  that information,  they will avoid  negative  coping  strategies,  
build  more  diversified  and climate  resilient  livelihoods .
Experiment
•Provision  of information  – early  warning  messages  (flood  alert,  disaster  risk/emergency  
preparedness,  disaster  management  and CSA)
•Transfer  of a lump  sum cash  (₦195,000 (~400USD)  to 725 flood -prone  HHs when  triggered  
by the climate  data risk thresholds,  and same  No. HHs (‘control  group’)  received  equal  
amount  of cash  post shock .
Study  area
•Fufore  LGA,  Adamawa

Key outcomes
Outcome1: 
Increase in climate 
adaptive actions 
Page 6:
Key results and implications
•Pre-shock  cash  payment  had significant  impacts  on:
•Household’s  rCSI and LCSI . HH less likely  to employ  negative  coping  strategies  in 
response  to the flood  shocks
•Labor  re-allocation  decisions  including  migration  of household  members . Generate  
additional  income  to meet  household  needs .
•Number  of pre-emptive  actions  households  took in anticipation  of flood  shocks .
•Long-term investment  decisions  on productive  agric . assets  and productive  livestock . 
This could  enhance  HH’s  future  income  generating  capacity  and reduce  their 
vulnerability  to future  shocks . Hence,  support  long-term resilience .
•No significant  difference  between  anticipatory  & post-shock  cash recipient  households  on 
FCS,  crop diversification,  mixed  crop-livestock  production,  and post-shock  actions  taken . 
Page 7:
Recommendations
•Given  the generally  positive  findings  on climate  resilience  capacity  and investment,  we 
suggest   humanitarian  agencies  and governments  to consider  anticipatory  interventions  
(such  as pre-shock  cash  transfers)  as a mechanism  for both meeting  basic  needs  (i.e., 
food consumption)  and improving  climate  resilience  of households . 
•As climate  shocks  continue  to worsen  and humanitarian  funding  needs  remain  unmet,  
anticipatory  interventions  may be critical  to meeting  the needs  of climate - and conflict -
affected  households .

2
•Conflict  remains  a major  driver  of poverty  in Africa   and conflicts  and political  
instabilities  have been increasing . 
•Explore  the relationship  between  violent  conflicts ; and farmers’  crop land; the share  of 
area planted  and harvested . 
•Implications  of conflict  on household’s  crop choices  and land allocation  decisions . 
•Explore  whether  conflict  shocks  influence  a shift from  high-investment  activities  to 
subsistence  activities .
•The relationship  between  violent  conflicts  and access  to community  services
Page 11:
www.cgiar.orgThe Data
•Geocoded  longitudinal  dataset  based  on an agricultural  survey  administered  in 
Nigeria  across  the three -wave  LSMS -ISA panel  survey . 
•Measured  conflicts  exposure  using  the number  of fatalities  associated  with incidents .
•Farmer’s  land allocation  was measured  using  the share  of area planted  in major  
crops  to total land area cultivated
•Based  on this measure,  we estimate  the effect  of violent  conflicts  on several  crop 
choice  and sales decisions . 
    
Page 12:
www.cgiar.orgKey Descriptive Findings
•Most  of the households  (70%) were  into cereals  production,  38% produced  legumes,  38% 
produced  roots,  while  very few (7%) produced  trees. 
•High  conflict  states : lower  percentage  of hired  labor  and lower  percentage  of purchase  of 
agricultural  inputs
•Land  area planted  with cereals  was higher  in high than in the low conflict  states .
•Area  covered  by roots  and trees is higher  in low than in high conflict  states . 
•HHs in low conflict  states  are more  likely  to engage  in wage  employment  & higher  market  
flexibility . 
Page 13:
www.cgiar.orgKey Empirical Findings
•Conflicts  reduced  land area dedicated  to longer -term crops  but increase  the share  of land 
area dedicated  to short -term crops  such as cereals . 
•Conflicts  reduced  the shares  of land area covered  with crops . Prolonged  conflict  may 
push HHs to exploit  a lower  % of their land for productive  activities
•Significantly  reduce  the shares  of agricultural  land harvested . 
•Conflicts  has a negative  significant  effect  on farmers  access  to market  and cooperatives .
•Negative  direct  effect  on investment  (area  planted,  area harvested)  and indirect  
(destruction  and disruption  of community  services)  
Page 14:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions
Violent conflicts affect land 
allocation patterns and cropping 
patterns, reducing land area 
allocated to longer -term crops 
such as trees and legumes that 
are amenable to longer -term soil 
management practices. 
Violent conflicts reduce market 
participation and hence induces 
production -oriented to satisfy 
own consumption.

Evaluation Questions
1.What is the productivity change gain for PBR cowpea compared to a conventional 
variety?
2.What is the effect of PBR cowpea on insecticide applications?
3.Does reduction in pesticide application translate to better health indicators for farmers 
and their families? 
4.Does the cultivation of PBR cowpea change household consumption of cowpea and/or 
increase cowpea surpluses? 
5.What are the heterogeneous impacts of PBR cowpea adoption by gender, age, and 
other household characteristics?

What is WEAGov ?
-WEAGov  – the Women’s Empowerment in Agrifood Governance 
tool – is an assessment framework to measure women’s voice in 
the agrifood policy process
-Developed by International Food Policy Research Institute 
(IFPRI) researchers and piloted in Nigeria by APRNet
-How can WEAGov  be used?
1.Measure women’s voice across different parts of the policy 
process
2.Identify entry points for raising women’s voice in different 
parts of the policy process
3.Track progress in women’s empowerment in agrifood policy 
process over time
Page 24:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
Page 25:
3
Women make up only 22%  of 
members of parliament 
worldwide…
… and only 16%  of 
cabinet secretaries
Page 26:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
-Gender equality within agrifood systems is essential to meeting 
SDGs, yet it is difficult to measure and track
-There is a need to identify specific windows and opportunities to 
raise women’s voice in the agrifood policy process in order to 
achieve meaningful progress
Page 27:
WEAGov  covers 3 stages of the policy 
process
Agenda setting, 
Policy design, and 
Policy adoption 
Policy

reformAgenda setting, Policy design, 
and Policy adoption : 
•Why certain social and

Policy implementation
•How policies are implemented 
in practice, including 
budgetary outlays,

•How policies are assessed 
against their objectives to 
know if changes are needed
Page 28:

How is WEAGov data collected? 
5 key measurement steps
▪Agrifood policy & stakeholder mapping → policy content analysis on gender 
integration and analysis of organizations involved in agrifood policy process
▪Desk review of objective, quantitative indicators of women’s empowerment in 
agrifood governance 
-e.g., # women ministers of agrifood agencies
▪Organization survey 
-Quantitative, objective data on staffing, gender strategies, gender activities of agrifood 
organizations
-Survey given to organizations involved in agrifood policy process – public sector (federal 
and state), private sector, and civil society organizations 
▪Expert survey 
-Perceptions and beliefs of key in -country stakeholders in the sector
-e.g., are opportunities for women’s participation well -known and utilized by key civil 
society actors  
-Survey given to leaders and experts in organizations in the agrifood policy process 
▪Technical panels or focus group discussions  
-Deliberate on measurement and validity with country experts

www.cgiar.orgIntroduction
•Government policies affect everyone, yet 
women are underrepresented in policymaking 
(Duflo 2012; Lawless 2015)
•Women’s participation in politics and civic life 
remains comparatively low (Iversen and 
Rosenbluth 2006)
•Reasons may include a lack of relevant skills and 
training, or norms that proscribe such behavior
•Worrisome as:
•Women’s unique policy needs may not be met if they lack voice and agency
•Women’s voice and agency in their community also help support women’s livelihoods

The Role of Spatial Inequalities on Youth Migration 
Decisions: Empirical Evidence from Nigeria
Mulubrhan Amare 
(with Kibrom A. Abay and Jordan Chamberlin )
Page 47:
www.cgiar.orgMotivation 
•The spatial  flow of labor  within  countries  responds  and contributes  to the geographical  
distribution  of economic  activity  and opportunity .
•Understanding  migration  decisions,  destination  and duration  helps  inform  our 
understanding  of the potential  outcomes  of alternative  regional  development  strategies . 
•How  different  types  of migrants  respond  to differences  in amenities,  resources,  and 
economic  activity,  to design  effective  policies  for migration,  
•Destination  perspective  to understanding  potential  pull factors  for various  forms  of 
migration
•Examine  how the attributes  of potential  destinations,  both in absolute  terms  as well as 
relative  to origins  of migration .
Page 48:
www.cgiar.orgObjectives
▪W e study youth migrants’ responses to observable characteristics of potential destinations 
and how these responses vary across various forms of migration.
▪Examine the role of observable attributes of potential destinations, both in absolute terms as 
well as relative to origin of migration.
▪Explore potential heterogeneity in the impacts of observable characteristics of potential 
destinations across various types of migrants. 
▪Understand pull factors of youth migration, a country characterized by relatively high rates 
of internal youth migration
▪Dyadic comparison of destinations and origins underscores the analytical importance of 
relative distributions of endowments.

•There are 3,140 youth migrants to each state. 
•Each of the migrants has chosen to move to one potential destination; and has therefore 
chosen not to move to the 36 remaining destinations. 
•Interested in explaining why each individual migrated to each actual destination and not to 
the remaining 36 states.

Destination choice of migrants by destination characteristics 
Page 51:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions and Implications 
•Migrants  respond  differently  to observable  characteristics  depending  on migration  pattern,  
duration,  and socioeconomic  status .
•Migrants  prefer  destinations  with higher  relative  welfare  and lower  cost of living .
•Rural -rural  migrants  are responsive  to agricultural  productivity  and land availability .
•Rural -urban  and urban -urban  youth  migrants  focus  on welfare  and urban  intensity .
•Permanent  migrants  prioritize  cost of living  but non-poor migrants  prioritize  welfare
•Policy  makers  can encourage  rural -rural  migration  by improving  agricultural  production  
potential  to reduce  youth  unemployment  and social  tensions  in urban  areas .

Experiments to accelerate 
adoption of improved 
varieties and quality seeds

Page 53:
What drives farmers, consumers and private sector decisions to 
adopt new varieties and related products?
The problem: New varieties (even if the best ones) are 
often not adopted because of behavioral barriers and 
processes. Examples:
•Benefits from drought -tolerant varieties only 
experienced when there is a drought
•Improved nutritional value: Difficult to observe
With these barriers, how to accelerate varietal 
turnover?
Limited or unpredictable demand will limit private sector 
interest in promoting new varieties and related products.
•How to get private sector to promote new products?
Page 54:
Research Question 1 – How can we accelerate varietal turnover?Main Investment: A behavioral multi -country multi -crop randomized trial
•Six experiments (5 countries) 
•Coordinated experimental designs – common interventions
•Quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, and the same outcome variables.
•Nigeria: Baseline survey completed and seed trial minipack distribution started 
Sites and crops: 
•Nigeria: cowpea, maize
•Ethiopia: teff and wheat
•India: green gram, groundnut, rice
•Kenya: maize, beans, cowpea, green 
gram, sorghum
•Uganda: maize, sweet potato (2 sites)
Page 55:
Study site: Bauchi and Kaduna states, Nigeria 
Sample size: 2,016 households in 252 villages surveyed at baseline
Constraints to adoption of newer 
varieties: 
•Lack of information about new 
varieties
•Farmers are cautious to try out new 
varieties
•Lack of access to improved seeds
•Poor management practices
•Gender -based constraints
❖Women have low access to information, 
improved seeds, inputs, mobility
❖Women lack decision -making in varietal 
selection and farmingInterventions being

1•This study explores the value of  quality assurance systems 
with an analysis of  certified seed production and 
distribution in Nigeria.
•Assess the associations between the quantity of  certified 
seeds produced and the spatial variations from where they 
are produced and,
•Spatial variations in the use of  certified seeds and/or 
improved varieties, yields, and output, and their relationship 
with agroclimatic and socioeconomic conditions

www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
4•Yield responses from certified seeds vary depending on the nature of  the farmland 
•When certified seeds are available, both yield and use increase. When it hits its peak, 
the effect of  the increase begins to diminish. 
•There are variations in the yields from certified seed which could be a result of  
climatic conditions and farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics.
•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
Page 64:
www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
5•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
•Farmers in close proximity to certified seed use it and improve their yields and 
outputs. This effect diminishes at the margin due to two factors
1.Yields from certified seeds vary considerably within each state, suggesting either 
quality issues in the supply chain or farmers not using complementary inputs or 
management practices when using quality seed.
2.As certified seed becomes more available to farmers, its use may spread from 
higher -return farms to lower -return farms, thereby diminishing the gains on the 
extensive margin.
Page 65:
www.cgiar.orgPolicy recommendations 
6•Revisit seed certification target in Nigeria
•Prioritize spatially the seed certification expansion effort if  it 
is still of  policy importance
•Promote more decentralized systems, like QDS / community 
seed schemes for rice, cowpeas, and OPV maize (as in various 
Eastern and Southern African countries)

Introduction to SAM
➢SAM  is a systematic  tool for economy -wide  analysis  and policy  prioritization,  used  to 
prioritize  the most  appropriate  investments  and suitable  policies  that can transform  the 
Nigerian  agricultural  food  market  and system .
➢SAM  is a national  accounting  framework  that captures  the circular  flow  of receipts  and 
payments  between  agents  and markets . 
➢SAM  provides  a complete  and consistent  dataset  of all economic  transactions  that takes  
place  within  the socio -economic  system .
➢Some  of the data  source  include : National  accounts  (NBS),  government  financial  statistics  
(Ministry  of Finance,  CBN),  Balance  of Payment  (IMF)  Household  expenditures,  and Labour  
Force  Surveys  etc.
Page 68:
Basic Structure of SAM
➢It sheds  light  on the activities  of the different  
economic  agents  by describing  the 
interrelationship  between  firms,  farms,  
households,  investors  and the external  sector .
➢The flow  of economic  activities  in monetary  terms  
from  expenditure/outflow  (col)  to income/inflow  
(row)
➢Activities  are domestic  firms  that  produce  goods  
and services  (commodities) . Factors  (labour , 
capital  and land)  are important  to produce  
activities . The activities  pay owners/suppliers  of 
factors  (households  – wages  and rents),  
government  (profits,  direct  tax),  and the rest of 
the world  (import,  debt  repayments)

The primary objective was to train them in collecting quality data within coffee-based farming systems in North Kivu and South Kivu provinces. This data collection is crucial for characterizing coffee farms and segmenting coffee farmers in DR Congo.

On the first day, enumerators learned about gathering household-level data, including socio-economic information, agricultural practices, and gender and youth-specific data. This encompassed household demographics, crop production, input management, food security, off-farm income, farm labor, access to inputs and machinery, market access, and attitudes towards innovation in coffee farming.

The second day focused on training enumerators in using the ODK application for questionnaire implementation.This comprehensive training aimed to equip enumerators with the skills to effectively gather data on various aspects of coffee farming practices, including plot management, pest control, and soil sampling.

Stakeholders of the workshop worked out four main pathways to address these compounding challenges. These are resource access and availability, livelihood and food security, disaster and conflict displacement and negative social behavior. Responding to the compounded challenges posed by the intersecting impacts of climate change with conflict and peace dynamics would only be possible by building a strong evidence base, as well as overcoming some of the constraints faced by the humanitarian,
development, and peace community. These two broader topics were addressed during the workshop and the key takeaways emerging from the discussions are presented in a corresponding key messages brief. These key takeaways are the basis of the recommendations proffered for the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and COP28.

RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL
1. Foster collaboration and partnerships around climate security through  
relevant multi-stakeholder platforms within different levels of regional, national 
and sub-national work and between international, governmental and non-
governmental actors to address the multidimensional challenges of climate 
security.
2. Mainstream a gender lens in programming not only as a component of 
projects but throughout the programming on climate action and climate 
security, ensuring the inclusivity of most vulnerable groups and sensitivity 
towards diverse exposure of individuals to climate and conflict impacts.
3. Increase the capacity of peacebuilders to address climate change issues,  
as well as their interaction with peace and conflict dynamics on climate 
change, including concepts and terminology, as well as identifying climate-
related risks to peace and security, and in turn how to address them by 
leveraging opportunities for synergy between peacebuilding and climate  
change responses.
4. Implement risk-informed programming along the Humananitarian 
Development Peace nexus through integrated approaches of humanitarian, 
development and peace programming to respond to the compounding 
challenges within conflict-affected areas exposed to climate impacts. 
5. Ensure conflict-sensitivity to climate action and climate finance to avoid 
maladaptation and mal-mitigation of climate action programming by adopting 
a peace-positive approach, aiming at co-benefits of climate resilience and social 
cohesion, and ensuring that catalytic climate finance is channelled into conflict-
affected areas. 
Towards a Common Vision of Climate, 
Peace, Security & Migration in

Climate and displacement-related 
peace and security pathways
Based on initial research by the CGIAR 
FOCUS Climate Security team, which 
was discussed in working groups during 
the workshop, four main pathways 
were identified, outlining the possible 
dynamics of interaction between 
climate and displacement-related risks 
Resource Availability  
and Access:  
Climate variability impacts 
the availability and access 
to resources. Changes in 
resources such as land, 
water and fish contribute 
to competition and affect 
local power relations. Weak 
governance of natural 
resources increases the 
risk of conflict.Livelihood and Food 
Insecurity:  
Climate change adversely 
impacts agricultural 
production and eroding 
rural livelihoods. Losing 
livelihoods induces 
poverty, inequality and 
food insecurity, inflaming 
instability, livelihood-
related grievances and 
conflicts. Disaster and Conflict 
Displacement: 
Climate and conflict 
dynamics interlink with 
displacement in complex, 
dynamic and non-linear 
ways. Climatic and social 
stressors intersect with 
livelihood and resource 
fragility, which affect 
the security and spatial 
and temporal realities of 
displaced communities.  Negative Social 
Behaviour:  
Climate change interacts 
with conflict dynamics 
and ongoing hostilities, 
impacting social tensions 
and negative social 
behaviours, including the 
strategies and tactics of 
armed groups. Negative 
social behaviour due to 
climate-related grievances 
damages social cohesion 
and increases the risk of 
tension and conflict.
CLIMATE SECURITY PATHWAYS IN MOZAMBIQUEWorkshop takeawaysContext 
The recommendations proffered 
are based on deliberation from a 
multistakeholder workshop titled 
“Towards a Common Vision of 
Climate, Peace, Security and 
Migration” held in Maputo on the 
20th and 21st of September 2023 that 
was co-convened by the CGIAR, in 
collaboration with the Ministry of 
Land and Environment, the Belgian Embassy, the Swiss Embassy and 
UNHCR. The workshop was attended 
by donors, CSOs, INGOs, UN agencies, 
and government departments. It 
sought to understand how stressors 
and shocks related to the increasing 
co-occurrence of climate change, 
conflict, displacement and fragility in 
Mozambique interact and reinforce 
each other to shape peace and security outcomes. The need for advancing 
a responsive and evidence-based 
approach to these compounding 
challenges has been stressed by 
the Permanent Representative of 
Mozambique to the United Nations 
(UN), ranking the climate, peace, and 
security agenda as one of the  
top priorities of the Mozambique non-
permanent membership in the UN 
Security Council (UNSC).

Mozambique. These climate security 
pathways were as below.
Although these pathways intersect 
in many ways, it is evident that 
each pathways contains a set of 
overlapping and unique drivers that 
help us understand the climate security landscape. Key underlying drivers and 
elements relevant to each pathway 
were identified through collaboration 
and discussion across sectors, building 
the evidence base of the current and 
foreseen climate-related risks to peace 
and security in Mozambique.

Main findings
Responding to the compounded 
challenges posed by the intersecting 
impacts of climate change with conflict 
and peace dynamics would only be 
possible by building a strong evidence 
base, as well as overcoming some of the 
constraints faced by the humanitarian, 
development, and peace community. 
These two broader topics were addressed 
during the workshop and the key 
takeaways emerging from the discussions 
are presented below. These key takeaways 
are the basis of the recommendations 
proffered for the UNSC and COP28. 
• Climate change’s impacts on food, 
land and water systems interact 
with causes and drivers of conflict 
to increase insecurity and violence: 
Nearly all agriculture in the country 
consists of small-scale rainfed farming, 
the livelihoods and food security of 
rural households are highly susceptible 
to climate and extreme weather 
events. This, combined with land 
grabbing, displacement dynamics and 
the ongoing conflict in Cabo Delgado, 
affects access to and availability of 
land. Maladaptive behaviour of most 
vulnerable groups is contributing 
to environmental degradation (e.g., 
deforestation), as well as recruitment 
into armed groups of marginalized 
people with grievances against the 
state. 
• Climate extreme events occurring 
in fragile and conflict-affected 
areas are compounding conflict 
dynamics, with devastating effects 
on human security. After impacts of 
Cyclones Kenneth and Idai in 2019, the 
humanitarian situation in northern 
Cabo Delgado severely worsened, 
due to the compounding impacts of 
conflict and disaster. The subsequent 
food and livelihood insecurity 
contributed to violence in the 
aftermath of the cyclone. One reason 
being that disrupted humanitarian 
assistance after cyclones in conflict-
affected areas provide an opportunity 
for armed insurgents group to gain 
ground and support among vulnerable 
populations.• The risks of disaster-induced 
displacement and conflict dynamics 
mutually reinforce each other over 
short, as well as long term effects, 
that need to be considered in 
resettlement projects. Displaced 
populations are among the most 
vulnerable towards climate impacts 
of slow onset and extreme events on 
the areas they are staying, as well as 
the routes they are taking. Although 
host communities have often been 
welcoming, the increasing influx of 
people, as well as further climate 
impacts on the natural resource base, 
has increased social tensions and 
competition with IDP populations. 
• While gender and cultural identity 
shape the power and capacity of 
different social groups to adapt and 
respond to climate and conflict-
related shocks and crises, such a 
lens has yet to be meaningfully 
integrated into policies and 
interventions. Discussions around the 
topic reduce gender to women, lacking 
a holistic approach to understanding 
both men's and women’s experiences 
of and needs in displacement and 
crisis times. Although driven by historic 
gender imbalances, caution must be 
taken to avoid further skewing the 
scales at the expense of men and the 
boy child.
• Mineral extraction of rare earths 
can have negative impacts on 
local communities, contributing to 
displacement through evictions, 
as well as insecurity by increasing 
grievances. The extraction of rare 
earth within mines of resource-
rich Cabo Delgado has altered land 
use changes that affect vegetation 
and local livelihoods. Flawed 
governance and evictions are thereby 
compounding conflict dynamics in 
the area. Moreover, emerging climate-
smart land politics with biofuel 
projects, like in Massingir, have also 
contributed to inter-community 
conflicts over scarce resources.• More localized data on the current 
and future impacts of climate change 
on food, land and water systems are 
needed to inform the design and 
implementation of preventive and 
anticipatory action measures based 
on worst-case scenarios. There is a 
lack of harmonised tools for research 
and coordination and communication 
of findings in Mozambique. Ministries 
and non-governmental organization 
are working with outdated climate data 
that poses challenges to their response 
in climate action programming 
directed to increase the resilience of 
communities. The level of early warning 
systems crucially dictates the impacts 
extreme events have on exposed 
communities. Communities in areas 
of Mozambique prone to cyclones 
had been relatively well prepared, but 
recent cyclones affected new areas 
of the country, hitting unprepared 
communities.
• Working in silos and 
compartmentalising efforts,  
finances and interventions to 
address problems of climate, 
climate and development often 
prevent more holistic and integrated 
solutions. In most instances, 
actors with the HDP nexus pioneer 
interventions that take siloed and 
uncoordinated approaches where 
projects address narrow elements 
of a complex system of vulnerability 
and challenges, significantly reducing 
their potential impact. Limited 
understanding of diverse needs and 
contextual dynamics can lead to 
conflict-insensitive humanitarian and 
development responses. There is a 
general lack of data on issues related 
to climate change, peace, security, 
forced displacement, migration and 
response to the impacts of climate 
change on the HDP nexus. Thus, 
researchers and research institutions 
should work towards generating 
robust and holistic data that will 
deepen the understanding of the 
phenomenon of climate change and 
its compounding effects on social 
cohesion and stability and inform 
programming along the HDP nexus.

The process
Page 13:
Scope:In this phase you will learn how to phrase a design challenge as a starting point for our HCD process and how to understand all aspects of this challenge.Explore:Here you’ll learn how to better understand people and their contexts. You will observe their lives, hear their hopes and desires, and make sense of all insights that you’ve collected.Methods per Phase
Create:Now you’ll use different approaches to generate a ton of ideas, identify opportunities for design, and built prototypes that you will test and refine iteratively.Validate:This is where you’ll bring your concept idea to life. You will learn how to systematically gather user requirements, how to design User Interfaces and Experiences and how to run a proof of concept with user testing, live-prototypes and field pilots to ensure optimal user adoption.Scale:When rolling out your solution into new countries, or to new user groups you can apply the same phases and methods as for your initial design process.

Web accesibilityThe Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are technical standards on web accessibility developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The guidelines represent a shared, international standard developed by many different stakeholders, including industry, disability organizations, government, and accessibility research organizations. WCAG isn’t a legal requirement, but a set of globally adopted standards. The guidelines aim to make websites, apps, electronic documents, and other digital assets accessible to people with a broad range of disabilities, including sensory, intellectual, learning and physical disabilities.The according website is here:https://wcag.comWith the practical tips for example here:https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/Guidelines from the US government: https://digital.gov/resources/best-practices-for-writing-for-accessible/

South Asia's rice-based farming systems, particularly the rice-wheat (RW) system in the Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP), are vital for regional food security and socio-economic stability. This system contributes 69% of the total food output in the country, encompassing 84% wheat and 54% rice, playing a pivotal role in India's food security. However, sustainability concerns have emerged in the post-green revolution era, with challenges such as soil degradation, declining land and water productivity, climate change, high input costs, and stagnating or decreasing yields. Issues like faulty irrigation, imbalanced fertilizer use, nutrient deficiencies, salinity, and crop residue burning exacerbate these challenges. To address these issues, a collaborative research team, including scientists from CCSHAU, ICAR-CSSRI, KVKs, and CIMMYT, conducted strategic trials in three Haryana districts (Ambala, Kurukshetra, and Karnal). The research aims to analyze cropping systems using a multi-criteria approach, contributing to sustainable agriculture and food systems in the region.  ","395"

boost crop productivity and agronomic benefits, these need to be integrated and combined with data
from various sources for input into analytical models and decision support systems. By leveraging data
pools, georeferenced datasets, and multivariate data sources, collaborative activities and data sharing

research techniques and contexts by utilizing digital tools that enable researchers to develop and
share digital data sets that are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable). When data is
shared in accordance with the same community-agreed-upon standards, it is easier to reuse it
throughout the data life cycle, and innovation is accelerated, as is the ability to deliver insights and
management options to stakeholders, including the ultimate beneficiaries, who are often poor
farmers. While the culture of data sharing is expanding, agriculture continues to lag in terms of making
data interoperable and reusable, necessitating a significant investment to integrate and demonstrate
the value of data that complies with the FAIR concept. Author ORCID identifiers Attaher, S.

Background:  
Agronomy research and development can improve yield, yield quality, and profitability; yield stability 
and risk reduction; utilization of resources efficiency (nutrients, water, and labor); and soil health. To 
boost crop productivity and agronomic benefits, these need to be integrated and combined with data 
from various sources for input into analytical models and decision support systems. By leveraging data 
pools, georeferenced datasets, and multivariate data sources, collaborative activities and data sharing 
across stakeholders provide insights efficiently. In this sense, it is critical to improve agronomic 
research techniques and contexts by utilizing digital tools that enable researchers to develop and 
share digital data sets that are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable). When data is 
shared in accordance with the same community-agreed-upon standards, it is easier to reuse it 
throughout the data life cycle, and innovation is accelerated, as is the ability to deliver insights and 
management options to stakeholders, including the ultimate beneficiaries, who are often poor 
farmers. While the culture of data sharing is expanding, agriculture continues to lag in terms of making 
data interoperable and reusable, necessitating a significant investment to integrate and demonstrate 
the value of data that complies with the FAIR concept. 
Excellence in Agronomy (EiA) and Fragility to Resilience in Central and West Asia and North 
Africa (F2R-CWANA) are “One CGIAR” Initiatives that aim for sustainable intensification and climate 
change adaptation in addition to building resilient agrifood systems in the region to support 
smallholder farmers by providing evidence-based data-driven agronomy solutions, while also having 
a positive impact on the CGIAR's impact targets of nutrition, health, and food security; poverty 
reduction, livelihood, and jobs; gender equality, youth, and social inclusion; climate adaptation and 
mitigation.  
ICARDA collaborates with sister CGIAR centers to support the implementation of EiA activities, 
with two use cases in Egypt and Morocco representing irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems in 
the arid region, respectively. The two use cases are being developed in partnership with national 
research institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), governments, and the private sector, 
with the goal of improving scientific knowledge, shaping practices, and informing policy.   
In the framework of EiA and CWANA regional initiative, ICARDA in partnership with EiA transferred 
team has organized a four-day capacity development in-person training course involving fourteen 
participants from Egypt. The main focus of the training was on the concepts and tools that can assist 
agricultural researchers in improving agronomic data development and management, as well as 
developing datasets that comply with the FAIR concept to meet the requirements of data-driven 
decision support solutions. working on agronomic research from different agricultural centres.  
 
Objectives: The main objective of the training was to transfer knowledge about ""open data"" and 
""FAIR"" principles, as well as their applications and tools for agronomic data production and 
management life-cycle. the major topics covered in the course were: 
 
 
- Open-data & FAIR principles, 
- Lifecycle of the data from agricultural experiments, 
- Tools for data collection/acquisition from controlled field experiments, 
- Tools for surveys,  
- Basic data cleaning, processing, and analysis. 
- Data visualization.

Training Outcome 
Enhance the participant's knowledge of the available tools to use in every step of the data life cycle in 
the agricultural research, provide enough resources on where and how to start exploring and using 
opine and FAIR data and tools to enhance research work efficiency, and improve the scientific quality 
of the participants’ produced reports and delivered services.  
 
Curriculum Development 
The curriculum was developed by Layal Atassi, Khaled Al-Shamaa, and Samar from ICARDA (Detailed 
curriculum/course program is attached as Annex 1). The course applies a mixture of different 
methods of implementation that includes lectures, and practical exercises accounting for around 
60% of the training time using appropriate software, tools, and apps. The training lectures were 
delivered in Arabic to overcome language barriers and simplify the training process. As a constant 
move toward digital transformation, no handouts were printed, and all course materials, including 
presentations dataset samples, and resources were supplied in English in digital forms, uploaded to 
cloud storage, and made available to participants to download and practice on their own. 
 
Course Management 
The in-person training course was held from 3 to 6 September 2023. The course was attended by 14 
young and mid-career researchers (50% females, 50% males) from the Agriculture Research Centre 
(ARC) of Egypt (List of participants is attached as Annex 2). The participants were nominated by the 
ARC president after direct communications with the ICARDA-Cairo office. The course venue was the 
Agricultural Genetic Engineering Research Institute (AGERI), which is located in the ARC complex in 
Giza-Egypt. ICARDA supported the engagement of five participants from outside Cairo and Giza by 
covering their accommodation logistics and costs during the training period. 
    
An invitation letter was sent to each participant with all the information related to the training, 
including the training flyer (Annex 3) and agenda, in addition to a registration form that was prepared 
using Google Forms. A Zero final assessment digital form was prepared and provided to the 
participants at the beginning and end of the training, and the overall course evaluation digital forms 
were prepared and provided to the participants at the end of the training. By the end of the training 
course, a certificate of completion has been sent to the participants who joined the training. 
 
Course Evaluation 
After completion of four days of training, participants were asked to evaluate the course providing 
well structure questionnaire for different course.  
This course used two levels of evaluation: 1) evaluating participant satisfaction (Course Evaluation by 
Participants), and 2) evaluating learning of participants (Evaluation of Participants by ICARDA). 
 
Evaluation Method 
The Course Evaluation by Participants was divided into two steps. The first was the topic evaluation, 
which was conducted at the end of every subject, and the second was the overall evaluation, which 
was conducted on the last day of the course.

The Evaluation of Participants (evaluation by ICARDA the Zero final assessment) was conducted 
by utilizing a pre/post-test, which was developed by instructors to assess participants’ knowledge of 
each subject. The pre-test was conducted on the first day of the course (3 Sep 2023), and the post-
test was conducted on the last day of the course (6 Sep 2023).

Recommendations for future cooperation 
The in-person training was a good activity to introduce the different agronomic data collection and 
management tools and provided the participants with enough knowledge and resources to explore on 
their own any of the provided tools that interest them the most and are sufficient for their work. It 
was interesting to monitor the real activity of the participants and the level of improvement while the 
participants showed a high level of engagement and tried to reflect the gained knowledge on their 
own work cases during the interactive discussions and hands-on training. By the end of the training, 
the participants raised the need to apply for more intense and longer courses covering the topics of 
agriculture data management and analysis, which enables more hands-on training and activities.

real-world space equipped with the latest technology.  An In-situ monitoring system  based 
on the establishment of a digital agricultural  plot in Guatemala represents a testing ground 
for automated agricultural . Located in the region's challenging dry corridor . This innovative 
plot, supported by CGIAR, CUNORI University, and the CGIAR initiatives on Digital 
Innovation and AgriLac, is designed to enhance decision -making and efficiency for small -
scale farmers. It achieves this through advanced in situ sensors and technologies that 
deliver precise data on climate and soil conditions. The plot functions as a laboratory, 
testing techno logies that are apt for the unique challenges of the dry corridor, with a focus 
on social, environmental, and economic efficiency, while also addressing the needs of the 
regional community. Conducting user research is crucial, serving as a compass to guide  our 
actions. This pioneering laboratory aims to optimize agri -food systems and expand the 
model, benefiting farmers in Guatemala and potentially in other countries, through the

 Introduc tion  
The Digital Agricultural Plot is an innovative concept that originated in early 2023, 
immediately after the graduation of 26 professionals from the “Digital Agriculture” diploma 
program at the Centro Universitario de Oriente (CUNORI) in the region and muni cipality of 
Chiquimula, in the dry corridor of Guatemala. Throughout the development of this diploma 
program, the need for an area equipped with technology for monitoring agroclimatic 
variables became evident, aiming to support decision -making in the agric ultural and 
environmental sectors.   
Therefore, this diploma, in addition to strengthening the technical capacity of the 
participants, also served as the starting point for an innovative idea that, over time, 
transformed into a tangible reality thanks to the digital innovation initiative of C GIAR. This 
initiative successfully established a space for the generation of information and learning, 
equipped with various types of technology at CUNORI university. This university plays a 
crucial role in the region as a significant contributor to the ed ucation of professionals in the 
agricultural and environmental sectors.    
 
This municipality of Chiquimula is situated within the Central American Dry Corridor, which, 
according to reports from INSIVUMEH1 , falls under the Eastern Valleys Climatic Region at 
the national level. Its primary characteristic is a rainfall deficit, making it the driest region in 
the country, with an annual rainfall average ranging between 700 to 1300 mm. In this 
context, the integr ation of the digital plot adds to the efforts aimed at generating local 
agroclimatic information. The main goal is to support decision -making and achieve 
adaptation to climate change, especially for small -scale producers of basic grains in this 
region. The se producers have been adversely affected by the rainfall deficit, resulting in 
reduced crop yields or even total loss, posing a threat to the food security of the region. In 
this context, the establishment of the digital plot adds to the efforts aimed at generating 
local agroclimatic information with the purpose of supporting decision -making and 
achieving adaptation to climate change.

What is Digital Agricultural Plot?    
The Digital Agricultura Plot is an in -situ monitoring system located at the facilities of the 
Centro Universitario de Oriente -CUNORI -. This Plot serves as a strategic space to promote 
and explore the use of sensors and advanced technologies in agriculture. It acts as a 
laboratory to test how field sensing technologies can benefit small -scale agric ulture and 
how the generated information can support decision -makers in the sector. Established in 
2023, this learning space incorporates innovative technologies focused on agroclimatic 
variables, along with agronomic practices aimed at achieving adaptatio n to climatic 
variability in the region of Guatemala. Among these practices, the use of biofortified and 
drought -resistant varieties of staple crops is highlighted.    
Another key practice being assessed for the food security of the region is moisture retention 
in the soil when crop residues are left. This information is crucial in the dry corridor, where 
heatwaves can impact the food security of the region (see  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WgmgUmm -iY&t=1s ).  in the assessment of crop 
residue management, including crop residue, the physical, chemical, and biological 
characteristics of the soil also evaluated using sensors for moisture, temperature, salinity, 
and macroelements.    
 
In addition to these sensors, the digital plot also features specialized equipment for 
measuring the water requirements of plants (lysimeters), as well as weather stations that 
measure variables such as precipitation, temperature, ambient humidity, and win d speed.   
In this way, the Digital Agricultural Plot incorporates the implementation of climate -smart 
agronomic practices, digital equipment such as lysimeters unique in Guatemala, and the 
use of drones to facilitate agronomic management activities in the crops.    
 
Finally, it is important to note that some sensors and weather stations are currently in the 
calibration phase for their respective validation. Successful calibration will provide tools for 
the generation of real -time agroclimatic information to support de cision -making for 
students, professors, researchers, members of agroclimatic technical committees, field 
technicians, farmers, and others.

usuarios antes de idear innovaciones destinadas a satisfacer sus necesidades. En última 
instancia, se buscó mejorar la alineación entre el grupo objetivo y el proyecto  que se estaba 
desarrollando. La investigación de usuarios, en particular, requirió la recopilación e 
interpretación de datos a través de entrevistas con el objetivo de entender el 
comportamiento, las necesidades, la experiencia y las motivaciones de los f uturos usuarios 
durante la fase de diseño. Los resultados de estas entrevistas proporcionaron información 
importante sobre cada uno de los usuarios, como se detalla en las figuras 4, 5, 6, 7 y 8  
información que se resume en la figura 3  al analizar sus metas, frustraciones, intereses y 
obstáculos en común, haciendo énfasis especialmente en temas de agricultura y clima, 
entre otros.

 Descarga de aprendizajes  
En esta etapa, el objetivo fue recapitular lo que se sabe, “dónde estamos” y “hacia dónde 
vamos”, dando respuesta a la siguiente interrogante: ""¿Tenemos todo lo que necesitamos?""  
Debido a que el trabajo en equipo es tan importante para DCH, por medio de este se 
incentiva compartir los aprendizajes individuales al resto del equipo.  
La sesión de descarga de aprendizajes permitió comprender los problemas y dudas que 
tenían los miembros del equipo de trabajo  (figura 9 ). Tener este ejercicio para abordar las 
dudas y reflexionar sobre lo que se había hecho como proyecto abrió un diálogo más 
preciso con los demás.  
Realizar este ejercicio, ayudó a apropiarse del proyecto, saber a quién preguntar, visualizar 
qué iba bien para continuar, pausar lo que ya estaba en progreso y priorizar algunos pasos 
para avanzar.

 Fase de creación – brief insight  
Tormenta de ideas  
En el transcurso del proyecto, se identificaron algunos obstáculos o simplemente decisiones 
que tomar, esta herramienta es una buena forma para buscar las formas más creativas de 
solucionar. Este ejercicio puede realizarse no solo con el equipo de diseño, sino también 
con los socios y las personas para las que está diseñando.  
Así pues, se realizó la primera tormenta de ideas compartiendo un formulario de Google a 
los visitantes de la Parcela Digital durante una visita el 14 de septiembre de 2023. Estas 
opiniones fueron clasificadas dentro de lo que está considerado a realizar d entro de la 
parcela digital, lo posible a realizar y lo interesante, tal como se observa en la figura 10 y 11 . 
También se tuvo oportunidad de preguntar si alguno de los visitantes había estado en un 
espacio similar a la parcela digital, a lo cual la totalidad de los visitantes respondieron no 
haber estado antes en un espacio de investigación como el de la parcela d igital.

Storyboards  
Son un prototipo rápido y de baja resolución. Este método no solo ayuda a refinar 
cómo se está estructurando el proyecto, sino que también puede ayudar a 
comprender quién lo usará, cuándo y cómo. Como todos los prototipos, la idea aquí 
es hacer algo realme nte ás  pero como una forma de ayuda para repensar los 
procesos de comunicación, implementación y diseño. En este caso, en las figuras 12 ,

 Fase de validación  
Reflexiones  
Un hito crucial en este proceso fue el escaneo profundo que realizamos para identificar a 
todas las partes interesadas y usuarios que están involucrados o estarán involucrados con 
la Parcela. Este análisis exhaustivo nos dio una comprensión completa de qui énes son los 
actores clave, cómo interactúan con nuestra iniciativa y, lo que es más importante, cómo 
podemos alinear sus intereses con nuestros objetivos.  
En resumen, el enfoque HCD no solo ha mejorado las interacciones con la Parcela, sino que 
ha transformado la dinámica de nuestro equipo y la gestión del proyecto. Ha sido la brújula 
que nos ha mantenido anclados en la realidad, ha facilitado la toma de dec isiones 
estratégicas y ha permitido un análisis profundo para identificar y comprender a todos 
aquellos que dan forma y serán parte integral de nuestro camino hacia el éxito. Este 
enfoque no es solo una metodología, sino una filosofía que ha elevado nuestr o proyecto a 
nuevas alturas

5  Concept of International Certificate Course in Digital Agriculture Information and communications (ICT) have touched many sectors and have proved beneficial in times. However, the agriculture sector is still in transition to figure and reap the benefits of ICTs. Although many ICT initiatives are going on in various forms all over the world, ICT use in agriculture is still to be fully explored in terms of use and impactful implementation. ICTs are used today in various steps and dimensions in agri-food systems, such as data collection, monitoring, deployment, and dissemination of information (N Serbulova et al. 2019). This data and information are used for decision-making in agri-food systems. Digital innovations, technologies, tools, and methods such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellites, global positioning system (GPS), Internet of Things (IoTs), on-site remote sensors, smart devices, voice and text messages, robots, unmanned ground vehicles etc. have opened a new domain of research in various agricultural applications (K H Coble et al. 2018, N N Misra et al. 2022). Further, advancement in software development, Big Data, predictive analytics, blockchain developments are proving to be successful in agriculture fields (A Kamilaris et al. 2019). Apart from all the aforementioned developments in the field of Digital Agriculture, the training and education of these tools among the agricultural professionals, students remain a strong complimentary necessity. Keeping in view of the changing and fast-growing sector of digital agriculture it is important to educate and expose the agriculture faculty to recent developments. The CGIAR is a network of international agriculture research centers that has been at the forefront of agriculture research on food-land-water systems for the past 50 years. The CGIAR is currently also undertaking inter-disciplinary research on digitalization trends in agriculture through the One CGIAR Digital Innovation Initiative (DI). One of the core research themes of the DI Initiative is capacity building to enhance the digital literacy and capabilities of women and youth and empower them in food, water, land systems.  CGIAR’s ‘International Rice Research Institute’ (IRRI) along with Sri Sri University conducted an online weekend diploma course over the period of seven weeks (40 hours including assignments) for the agricultural students and professionals in digital agriculture. The course aimed to strengthen the technical capacity of technicians, students, and agricultural professionals in the current field and allow them to make more informed decisions regarding agri-food systems.  This was a unique diploma course on Digital Agriculture conducted all over India as it gave the participants the flexibility to attend the course over weekend in an online mode from the comfort of their homes.

6  Objectives of the course The major objectives of this online digital agriculture course were: ● to bridge the gap between creating skilled agricultural professionals and to become to become progressive and practicing farmers/ agricultural professionals. ● act as platform to encourage partnerships and collaborations between students seeking professional career in Digital Agriculture and the experienced digital agriculture professionals. ● encouraging students to generate technologies and/or provide services to promote agriculture is directly in line with the course aims.  ● reach out to diverse groups of students who seek knowledge in digital agriculture. This course was attended by agricultural students who (i) are not familiar with digital tools, (ii) have limited knowledge on interpreting data and (iii) lack a vision beyond sustainable crop production and an entrepreneurial spirit. The course was designed to benefit the students who have basic prior knowledge of statistics, ideally with knowledge of quantitative and analytical methods, ability to communicate orally and in writing, technical background on agri-food, food safety, and environment sectors may participate in the diploma course.   The graduates of this diploma course are expected to develop competencies in use of digital technologies, apply the user-centered design principles and application of management and data analytics, use of ICTs to create more inclusive digital systems, interpret the information available to solve problems associated with agri-food, agri-businesses, and environmental systems, manage data, apply analytical techniques, and have a better understanding of how digital technologies can be scaled. The course also aimed at fostering partnerships and collaborations between like-minded people who had similar kinds of areas of expertise and gave the students a chance to establish contacts with teams and individuals who work in the field of Digital Agriculture for future projects or guidance.

Fair distribution of the benefits of climate-resilient agriculture matters given that some people, and communities, are more vulnerable to risk than others. Agricultural systems are at particular risk from climate change. As evidence shows, poor and vulnerable people disproportionately experience the worst climate impacts. Smallholder farmers, especially women and young people, are particularly vulnerable given structural inequalities that limit their access to resources, services, and agency, which ultimately limits their capacity to build resilience. If climate-smart and climate-resilient interventions do not adequately take gender differences into account, they might exacerbate gender inequalities in food systems.

Priority Goals
This provides opportunities to showcase and promote nature-based solutions (NBS) informed by
indigenous peoples' beliefs, value systems, and ways of knowing. This is critical because food security
and human rights of indigenous peoples, including pastoralist, forest, and fisher communities must be
protected, promoted, and always enjoyed and all places. the food systems approach provides a
comprehensive and holistic perspective on agriculture and food security in line with paragraph 14 (a) of
the SSJW on the implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security which underscores
that the joint work should aim at “promoting a holistic approach to addressing issues related to
agriculture and food security”. This  workshop provided a platform for indigenous peoples’ representatives to outline their priority
needs to input into Third National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP, 2023-27) that is led by the
Ministry of Environment and Forestry through the Climate Change Directorate. An accelerated
programme of the finalisation has targeted the government launch of the NCCAP 2023-2027 at the
Africa Climate Summit, in Kenya, in September 2023. 
The representatives of indigenous peoples, who included a representation of women, youth, and
persons with disabilities, at the meeting for 3rd and 4th August 2023, discussed their experiences
about environmental justice and its cross-cutting aspects within the 7 sectors. This discussion is
geared towards generating data that will inform the development of the NCCAP 2023-27 and influence
policy positions including the upcoming Africa Climate Summit, the UNFCCC processes and the
national climate change policies and initiatives. This meeting provided opportunities for translating
constitutional & policy gains in recognition of indigenous knowledge systems and practices related to
climate change into meaningful programs and actions at the county and country levels.
The NCCAP 2023-2027 provides a welcome opportunity to mainstream ownership and access rights
for indigenous communities, for them to effectively engage in sustainable livelihoods. This will
contribute to the country being able to meet other rights like the right to food, across a bigger section
of the population, considering that indigenous peoples are more than 20% of Kenya’s population.
Indigenous Peoples interventions seek to contribute to the four-year Sharm el-Sheikh Joint Work
(SSJW) on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security, especially by pushing for
the food systems approach, ensuring sustainability and hence deliver food security and nutrition for all
(especially indigenous peoples, including the disadvantaged gender groups), without compromising the
welfare of future generations through harmful economic, social, and environmental practices.

BACKGROUND
Intervention Summary
Indigenous People with disabilities at the NCCAP workshop
Page 3:
Indigenous peoples’ organised participation in the on-going development of the National Climate Change Action
Plan 2023-27 is of critical importance. These communities occupy areas that are most sensitive to climate change,
and being totally natural resource dependent for their livelihood, they are disproportionately affected by climate
change impacts. This is because climate change presents an added burden to them as they already disadvantaged
socially, politically, and economically by the fact that they are marginalised. Comprising of about 20% of the
Kenyan population, according to the most recent 2019 census, it is, therefore, imperative that any planned
decision likely to affect their livelihoods should include their priorities, views, dreams, and aspirations. Climate
change response is one such decision
The objectives
Ensure placeholders and anchors for the
promotion and application of indigenous
knowledge in climate change programming and
actions are integrated into the NCCAP 2023 - 27
Contribute towards operationalisation of
constitutionally guaranteed rights and affirmative
action principles in access to climate finance for
IPs ... ensuring those with the least Carbon
footprint, most negatively impacted by climate
change are safeguarded against further impact
and support for enhanced resilience/adaptation.  
Ensuring the legislative and policy gains with
respect to indigenous peoples’ representation and
consultation in decision-making arrangements
related to climate change include in the National
Climate Change Council, national oversight board
for REDD+, IPs action plan in REDD+ and FPIC are
integrated into the NCCAP.1.

Expected Output 
The output for this workshop is the Draft National
Climate Change Action Plan with inputs from the
indigenous communities. 
Expected Outcomes 
Indigenous people should with deep understanding of their roles
Voice out IP concerns through a public participation in the NCCAP process
An engagement for climate information, engagement,, and inclusion 
A partnership between the Kenya Human Rights Commission with CEMIRIDE Importance of indigenous peoples in the NCCAP process. 
Their participation is also envisaged under the
Constitution of Kenya 2010 as well as the Climate
Change Act of 2016. Indigenous people’s voices are,
therefore, critical in ensuring success of intervention
measures as well the needs, perspectives and
experiences they bring on board through their
indigenous and local knowledge.
“Indigenous peoples’ voices
are critical in revitalizing
traditional knowledge and
technologies in agriculture ,
bio diversity conversation,
and natural resource
management, which is key
to attaining climate
resilience” Nyang’ori
Ohenjo, CEMIRIDE

action through NCCAP to secure Indigenous Peoples'
Livelihoods- StellaMaris Mulaeh(Fasternaktion)
Key message
Indigenous Peoples' interaction with food systems,
has proved a dynamic innovator and co-creator for
knowledge for all humanity. Indigenous peoples
generate hundreds of food items from the
environment without depleting natural resources
and achieve high levels of self-sufficiency.
Enhance, protect and restore indigenous food ways
Continuous updating of knowledge on traditions, cultural systems and practices, including
rotational farming, gathering, fishing, trapping, food gardens and cultivation.Pastoralism and biodiversity
 Genetic Level: Pastoralists often rely on locally adapted livestock breeds and crop varieties that can resist
disease outbreaks, drought, and other pressures, including climate change.
Species Level:  By retaining species and management practices that have evolved in parallel with the local
environment, pastoralists retain important species interactions (e.g. herbivory, host-parasite, and nutrient
cycling), which benefit many wild species of plants, birds, and insects.
Ecosystem Level:  Many ecosystems have evolved because of interactions with grazers. For example,
pastoralism maintains a patchwork of habitats including open areas, which are important for nesting birds.
Furthermore, livestock are important contributors to food cycles.
 Traditional migratory and cross-border pastoralism: conservation of grazing territories and their utilisation
for meat, milk, fibre, fuel, and others
Core Principles in Climate Justice
• Self-determination
• Collective rights
• Gender equality
• Participation and inclusion
• Cultural rights
• Rights over lands and other natural resources

The Importance of Indigenous Voices in Climate Change Policy –
Nyang’ori Ohenjo 
Nyang’ori Ohenjo using the Voices for Change video explained why it was important to use documented
voices of indigenous peoples and their practices to influence policy discussions and negotiations in climate
change.
He noted that CEMIRIDE has partnered with CGIAR through IRRI, in its
Climber project to document the voices of pastoralists and forest peoples
on climate change, food security, and human rights, and these stories
were being used to communicate with policymakers. 
This was an interesting strategy since it provided the avenue for
communities to communicate more authentically, and with unadulterated
content to policymakers, drawing a more real picture of the situation,
especially where good practices that could be scaled up were concerned.
A video by Jane Chepkwony, on how she and her family navigated the
challenges of prolonged drought was shared. This story provides valuable
lessons about how indigenous knowledge and technology around
pastoralism can be adapted to design indigenous peoples' friendly
climate change adaptation programmes like pasture. He explained that in the current context where the impacts of climate change on IPs were intensifying, IPs
need to strengthen and diversify the strategies that they were using to reach out to critical audiences, to
secure their livelihoods (pastoralism, fisheries, and forest livelihood practices like beekeeping). 
Participants strongly related their experiences with the story of Jane. During the plenary discussion, many
participants expressed similarities between intensifying drought and reducing land spaces hence the need to
save the indigenous pasture seed and adapt other technologies like drought-resistant crops for enhancing
resilience to climate change impacts.

Climate Change Impacts
Kenya’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions represent less than
1% of total global emissions. 
Kenya's Economy is heavily dependent on climate-sensitive
sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, tourism, wildlife,
and health that are heavily impacted by climate change. 
The Economic Survey for 2017 reports that the economic cost
of droughts is estimated to create an average long-term fiscal
liability equivalent to 3% of GDP (equivalent to KES 230
billion per annum).
The floods in early 2018 claimed lives and displaced hundreds
of thousands. 
The flood was preceded by the 2014-18 droughts which were
declared a national emergency in February 2017 and affected

 Introduction  
The Reflection and Review , Work Package (WP) 3 Workshop took place on July 7, 
2023, at the ILRI Campus in Addis Ababa. The event was a ttended by thirty -five 
stakeholders, including NARS researchers, policymakers, government and extension 
officers, university representatives, SI -MFS staff and consultants, and delegates from 
Ethiopian farmer organizations .  
The MFS team aimed to ensure that their current research and in terventions  of 
ICARDA were in harmony with local interests and would aid in the creation of 
sustainable and robust farming systems in Ethiopia. This engagement was pivotal in 
grasping the requirements and viewpoints of local farmers, researchers, 
policymakers, and other key participants in Ethiopia's agricultural sector. The 
understanding gained was essential for developing customized interventions that 
effectively address the distinct challenge s and opportunities inherent in each 
farming system.  The presenters used case studies and real -life examples to illustrate 
the key concepts and engage the participants. The session was interactive; 
participants could ask questions and share their perspectives. This information 
helped to set the stage for the reflection and review process and provided a 
common understanding for workshop participants.  
 
The objectives were : 
• To facilitate the interaction between the SI -MFS Work Package 3 Lead, Aymen 
Frija, and stakeholders in Ethiopia.  
• To gain a deeper understanding of the farming systems in Ethiopia that are of 
particular interest to the SI -MFS Initiative.  
• To reflect on and review the activities of SI -MFS Work Package 3 and the 
International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas  (ICARDA) in 
Ethiopia.

 Workshop Sessions  
The Workshop for Reflection and Review consisted of five sessions, which featured 
an icebreaker activity, oral presentations to set the scene  for the workshop , oral 
presentations,  and poster tour s of ICARDA MFS  activities in Ethiopia , a training 
presentation on Systems Approach, and group work  on System  Mapping , Sketching  
& Readiness for sustainable intensification and integration across components . 
 
Session 1: Icebreaker activity  
The ""pair up""  activity  facilitate d participants in acquainting themselves with one 
another and fostering connections. It entailed forming pairs with a different person 
for three rounds, each lasting five minutes, guided by distinct questions. During 
these sessions, participants introduced themselves and discussed what they take 
pride in regarding their work. This inquiry prompted them to contemplate their 
accomplishments and strengths in sustainable intensification and mixed farming 
systems.  
 
Furthermore, participants recounted a successfu l experience in mixed farming 
systems, including the elements that contributed to this success. This part of the 
activity emphasized exemplary cases of sustainable intensification in mixed farming, 
pinpointing key factors of success that could be useful for future projects.  
Lastly, participants expressed their expectations from the meeting, allowing them to 
ponder over their objectives for the workshop and pinpoint mutual interests or 
concerns. This question was designed to help participants clarify their g oals and 
aspirations for the event . 
 
 
Session 2: Scene setting  
Scene -setting focused on the overview of the MFS initiative and involved a 
presentation by Aymen Frija  (MFS WP 3 Lead ; Fig. 1 ), in providing context and 
background information on the initiative, the theory of change for W P 3, and the 
plan of outputs for 2023. The overview of the initiative introduced the initiative's 
overall goals, objectives, and strategies. This included a discussion of the challenges 
facing smallholder farmers in Ethiopia  and the need for sustainable intensification 
and diversified farming systems to improve livelihoods, food security, and 
environmental sustainability.  
 
The Theory of Change (ToC) presentation focused on the specific goals, outcomes, 
and activities of WW to promote sustainable intensification and diversification of 
mixed farming systems in Vietnam. The T oC outlined the key assumptions, risks, and 
strategies for achieving the desired outcomes and the indicators and targets for 
measuring progress . 
 
The presenters used case studies and real -life examples to illustrate the key 
concepts and engage the participants. The session was interactive; participants 
could ask questions and share their perspectives. This information helped to set the 
Page 8:

Session 3: Oral presentation s and poster tour s of ICARDA MFS  
activities in Ethiopia  
To foster collaboration and teamwork, the facilitators employed interactive methods 
such as group exercises , poster walkthroughs  and oral presentations in this session . 
These approaches enabled attendees to actively engage with the posters on display , 
facilitating discussions and exchange of ideas among them.  Additionally, the session 
incorp orated a question -and-answer segment, giving the participants a chance to 
inquire and seek clarifications on the research work.  
 
In Muluken Zeleke's oral presentation  (Fig. 2 ), four distinct Sustainable Intensification 
(SI) initiatives were highlighted. These encompassed: 1) sheep fattening as a means 
for economic upliftment of youth and women via better feeding methods; 2) 
advancement of food -feed characteristics and value chain assessment for barley in 
animal husbandry; 3) improving sheep fattening proce sses using community radio; 
and 4) promoting feed mechanization led by youth for balanced diets and 
commercialization in sustainable livestock management.  
Dina Nijjar ’s presentation on participatory action research aimed at transforming 
gender norms and empowering women and youth in Ethiopia’s mixed barley -
livestock systems. This presentation offered valuable perspectives on the obstacles 
encountered by women and youth in these farming systems, as well as the methods 
employed to tackle these issues through  participatory research and empowerment 
efforts . 
Yetsedaw Ayenew presented the participatory co -design of MFS with evidence -

Session 4: The System Approach  
The presentation by Aymen offered a comprehensive summary of essentia l ideas 
and definitions connected to systems thinking  for creating scenarios in agricultural 
systems. The presentation (Fig. 3) described a five -step iterative protocol  for creating 
scenarios in agricultural systems  which offer a systematic framework to develop 
scenarios that aid in understanding and planning for the future of agriculture.   
 
 
Figure 3: Dr. Aymen Frija presenting the protocol to derive scenarios applied to an 
agricultural system . Photo Credit: Apollo Habtamu.  
 
The protocol begins with pro blem framing, identifying key challenges and issues in 
the agricultural system. It then moves to scenario design, generating various 
plausible future scenarios based on driving forces and uncertainties. The next step  
involve s scenario quantification, evaluating the performance of each scenario using 
specific indicators, and scenario evaluation, comparing and analysing the quantified 
Page 10:
5 
 scenarios to identify strengths, weaknesses, and trade -offs. The final step is scenario 
implementation, utilizing the selected  scenarios to inform decision -making and 
policy development. The iterative nature of the protocol ensures its adaptability as 
new information emerges. Overall, this protocol provides a structured approach, 
enabling informed decision -making and future planning for agricultural systems . 
 
During the presentation, Aymen  discussed a socio -technical innovation called 'multi -
stakeholder knowledge hubs' as an example  (Fig. 4). He emphasized the practical 
protocols involved in implementing knowledge and scaling hubs . He highlighted 
the benefits of these hubs, such as their ability to engage project beneficiaries and 
facilitate a self -sustaining scaling process effectively . He also mentioned the 'four -
wheels approach' of partnership for scaling innovations. According to Aymen , 
integrating agricultural innovation with knowledge hubs would promote learning 
and instill  confidence in stakeholders regarding the innovation. Additionally, this 
approach would facilitate the dissemination of innovations to a broader network of 
partners who can further contribute to scaling the technology.

transformative technologies (source: Frija & Idoudi, 2020).   
 
 
After presenting the key concepts, Aymen facilitated an activity where participants 
could put these ideas into practice. The task required splitting participants into 
smaller teams to create a system diagram for a particular farming system in 
Ethiopia . The objective was to produce diagrams highl ighting the various elements 
of the system, illustrating the flow  of resources and information among these 
elements, and pinpointing the feedback mechanisms influencing system behaviour . 
The purpose of this exercise was to help participants understand how d ifferent parts 
of the farming system are interconnected and to pinpoint areas where interventions 
could lead to improvements . 
 
Page 11:

 Session 5: Groupwork  
The Groupwork Sketch System activity was conducted by splitting participants into 
two groups from the  two d ifferent I CARDA  intervention locations , Basona  Worena 
and Doyogen,  in Ethiopia . The task for each group was to draw a system diagram 
representing a particular farming system at their respective site. The purpose of this 
task was to monitor how the system functions in relation to M FS activities and 
pinpoint areas that could be enhanced.  To steer this activity, facilitators handed out 
instructions that outlined a methodical way to create the system diagram. These 
instructions aided the participants in recogni zing various elements of the farming 
system, understanding how res ources and information circulate among these 
elements, and identifying the feedback loops that influence the behavior of the 
system . 
 
The guidelines included the following steps:  
▪ Determine the elements of the agricultural system, which may encompass 
aspects such as crops, livestock, soil, water, labor, markets, and other pertinent 
factors.  
▪ Ascertain the dynamics of resource and information exchange among these 
elements. This involves tracking  the movement of nutrients from soil to crops, 
the distribution of water from irrigation systems to crops, the allocation of 
labor from farmers to livestock, and the transmission of market intelligence 
from buyers to farmers.  
▪ Identify the feedback mechanisms that influence the system's behavior. This 
includes recognizing positive feedback mechanisms that amplify certain 
behaviors or outcomes, like increased livestock production leading to more 
manure for soil fertility, and negative feedback mechanisms that  mitigate or 
regulate certain behaviors or outcomes, such as soil degradation caused by 
overgrazing . 
 
Phase  1: Mapping  the system  
Basona Worena  (Fig. 5)  and Doyogena groups  mapped the existing mixed farming 
system during the group work, aiming to understand its different components, 
drivers, and dynamics. Initially, they outlined the primary and secondary crops, 
livestock, households, and other economic units involved in the system. 
Subsequently, they grouped the key system processes, identifying the compon ents' 
relationships and representing the system's essential actions and flows. The groups 
sketched how these processes are managed, controlled, and interconnected by 
mappin g the drivers, inputs, and outputs. Special attention was given to key 
structural variables and variables that could be utilized to depict typologies, 
providing valuable insights into the functioning of the farming system.

Phase 2: Assessing System Readiness for S ustainable Intensification and 
Integration across Components  
Following the comprehensive sketching of the farming systems in both locations, 
the group identified and examined the key components within these systems, 
considering their interconnectedness. A ranking system from 0 to 9 evaluated  each 
component's readiness level. This subjective assessment provided valuable insights 
into the degree of integration between the components and highlighted areas 
requiring improvement , (Fig. 6) . For instance, in the f arming systems of Ba sona, the 
integration of livestock and input components was ranked at level 2, indicating the 
potential for further integration by addressing the constraints related to input 
interventions. Recognizing the significance of input availability for system 
performance, this assessment facilitated a deeper understanding of the areas where 
interventions and enhancements are most needed.  
 
After examining the system diagrams, participants pinpointed regions where 
strategic actions could enhance t he system's performance. Such  actions may involve 
initiatives to boost soil quality, strengthen crop -livestock synergy, advance market 
connectivity, and augment water management, among other areas.

Participants, after examining the system diagram s, pinpointed regions where 
strategic actions could enhance the system's performance. These actions may 
involve initi atives to boost soil quality, strengthen crop -livestock synergy, advance 
market connectivity, and augment water management, among other areas.  
 
 
Phase 3: Identifying Specific Challenges and SIAF Indicators  
The application of the Sustainable Intensification Assessment Framework (SIAF) 
offers a robust methodology for evaluating the current state of the farming system, 
envisioning desired transformations, and strategically identifying entry points and 
innovations for sustainable intensification. Through a syst ematic and integrated 
approach, this step ensures a comprehensive and context -specific assessment, 
laying the foundation for impactful interventions in agricultural sustainability.  
 
During Step 3 of the group work, a thorough examination of specific challenges and 
SIAF indicators was conducted to assess the current state of the farming system and 
explore its potential for transformation. SIAF indicators, encompassing various 
dimensions, were employed to evaluate the system's performance. These indicators 
were further divided into sub -indicators, including productivity (crop yield, animal 
production, production variability), economic aspects (profitability, profit variability, 
labor req uirements), environmental factors (biodiversity, water quality, soil quality), 
human considerations (nutrition, food security, health), and social aspects (gender 
equity, social cohesion, collective action).  
Page 14:

The assessment was conducted under Business as Usual (BAU) conditions and 
normative scenarios, envisioning potential tran sformations through Sustainable 
Intensification (SI). The indicators were evaluated on a scale of 0 to 5, enabling a 
nuanced understanding of the system's current state  (BAU scenario) and the 
potential future state (Normative Scenario). This process helped participants identify 
the current qualification levels of SIAF indicators within the BAU system and  
envision target scores for a more performance -oriented and sustainable farming 
system , (Fig. 7).

Phase 4: Identifying Entry Points and Core Innovations  
Advancing to Step 4 within the group work, the primary focus revolved around 
pinpointing the entry points for Sustainable Intensification (SI) and core innovations 
necessary to catalyze the desired changes in the farming systems. This phase 
involved conducting a comprehensive analysis of the relationships  which facilitated 
the identification of key areas where interventions could hav e the most significant 
impact  as indicated in the figure 6 and 7.  
Page 15:
10 
 The entry points for SI were determined based on the frequency and importance of 
these relationships, offering valuable clues for subsequent actions. Components 
consistently appearing  in critical relationships were deemed key entry points for 
sustainable intensification, suggesting that interventions in these areas would yield 
substantial benefits.  The desired changes identified in these tables served as guiding 
principles for selecting  core  innovations, ensuring alignment with the overarching 
goal of susta inable intensification. By strategically identifying entry points and core 
innovations, the group aimed to pave the way for transformative changes that 
would enhance the sustainability and productivity of the farming systems.  
 
 
Phase 5: Linkages with WP3 and System Readiness (SR) Insights  
The group exercise yielded valuable insights that held particular significance for 
Work Package 3 (WP3) and the assessment of System Readiness (SR) in gene ral. In 
Step 5 of the Sustainable Intensification Assessment Framework (SIAF), the focus 
shifted towards establishing meaningful connections with WP3 and leveraging the 
insights gained from System Readiness to enhance the overall effectiveness of the 
assessment process.  
This step provided crucial inputs for WP3, aiding in developing or validating farming 
typologies. The detailed analysis of relationships, key innovations, and entry points 
conducted in Step 4 generated valuable data and information that can help identify 
specific gaps and knowledge requirements in system research. The findings and 
insights derived from the SIAF exercise formed a solid foundation for informed 
discussions and dialogues with system researchers, policymakers, and organizations 
involved in farmi ng systems.  
By establishing linkages with WP3 and leveraging the System Readiness insights, 
the group aimed to foster collaboration and exchange of knowledge, ultimately 
contributing to the advancement of sustainable intensification efforts.  This 
integration of findings and collaboration across different domains ensured a holistic 
approach to address the challenges farming systems face, encouraging effective 
decision -making and policy formulation.

 3. Lessons Learnt  
The session on discussions/ lessons Learnt/ emerging Issues involved participants 
engaging in a reflective and interactive dialogue, focusing on new challenges and 
acquired insights, and exploring future directions for the MFS initiative in Ethiopia . 
They pinpointed three key issues to be addressed by the  MFS  team, chiefly 
concerning the difficulties smallholder farmers face, including climate change, soil 
degradation, and market accessibility.  
Moreover, participants explored critical questions for  MFS  teams advancing the 
initiative, concerning its overarching objectives and tactics. These considerations 
included strategies for sustaining interventions, scaling successful practices, and 
ensuring the engagement and empowerment of women and youth.  
The discussion also covered possible st rategies for the MFS  initiative's progression in 
Ethiopia , involving collaboration with various local stakeholders, continuous research 
and monitoring, and interaction with policymakers and key decision -makers .

CGIAR  Initiative  on Climate  Resilience  
The CGIAR Initiative on Climate Resilience, also known as ClimBeR, aims to transform the 
climate adaptation capacity of food, land, and water systems and ultimately increase the 
resilience  of smallholder  production  systems  to better  adapt  to climate  extremes.  Its goal  
is to tackle vulnerability  to climate  change  at its roots  and support  countries  and local  
and indigenous communities  in six low-and middle -income  countries  to better  adapt  and 
build  equitable  and sustainable futures.

6  BACKGROUND  
 
Given its vulnerability to a range of natural hazards, Sri Lanka finds itself at heightened risk of 
encountering both flood and landslide disasters. These occurrences are notably exacerbated 
during the monsoon seasons, which transpire from May to September and October to January, 
contingent upon the specific region. Recognizing  the need for  effective disaster management, it 
becomes imperative to prioritize proactive approaches over traditional reactive measures in 
order to mitigate and curtail the impact of these disasters. This strategic shift is crucial for 
enhancing the country's resilienc e and responsiveness to the challenges posed by floods and 
landslides.  
Anticipatory Action refers to a proactive approach taken to mitigate the impact of impending 
disasters or crises  before they occur. This strategy involves identifying potential risks or threats, 
monitoring early warning signals, and implementing measures to reduce the vulnerability of 
communities  and systems.  The goal is to take  preventive  actions  in advance,  based  on forecasted 
events or indicators, to minimize the severity of the impact and enhance overall preparedness.  
World Vision Lanka (WVL) is presently executing an Anticipatory Action for Disaster Mitigation 
Project, receiving  support  from  key stakeholders  such  as the Disaster  Management  Centre 
and the National Building Research Organization. The project's implementation spans the 
Ambagamuwa and Nuwara Eliya Divisional Secretariats in the Nuwara Eliya District. This initiative 
is an integral component of a larger pilot project conducted by World Visi on International across 
six countries in the Asia Pacific Region. Fun ding for this broader effort is provided by Aktion 
Deutschland Hilft (ADH) Germany.  
Furthermore,  WVL  and IWMI  have  established  a collaborative  partnership  to pilot  this approach 
in a drought -prone area and integrate the framework into the ""AWARE"" platform. This  platform, 
functioning as an early warning to early action and finance dashboard, facilitates enhanced 
coordination and accountability for anticipatory action coordination. The joint efforts of WVL and 
IWMI aim to contribute meaningfully to disaster mitigat ion and community resilience  in the 
specified regions.  
 
 
Workshop  objectives  
The primary aim of this national workshop is to formally present and acquaint participants with 
the ongoing  activities  of the Anticipatory  Action  Project  within  the Thalawakale Divisional  
Secretariat  Division.  The workshop  serves  as a platform  to comprehensively  introduce the  various  
aspects,  objectives,  and progress  of the project,  fostering  a deeper understanding  among 
stakeholders regarding its implementation and impact within the specified geographic area.

Training of smallholder farmers and livestock experts on improved chicken management practices at SAPLING sites in Ethiopia. Nairobi, Kenya: International Livestock Research Institute.      About SAPLING CGIAR’s Sustainable Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender inclusion (SAPLING) is working in seven countries focusing on livestock value chains to package and scale out tried-and-tested, as well as new, innovations in livestock health, genetics, feed and market systems. SAPLING aims to demonstrate that improvements in livestock productivity can offer a triple win: generating improved livelihoods and nutritional outcomes; contributing to women’s empowerment; and reducing impacts on climate and the environment. Its seven focus countries are Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Nepal, Tanzania, Uganda and Vietnam.  Acknowledgements This work was conducted as part of the CGIAR Initiative on Sustainable Animal Productivity. CGIAR research is supported by contributions to the CGIAR Trust Fund. CGIAR is a global research partnership for a food-secure future dedicated to transforming food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis.

 2 Background to training  The aim of CGIAR’s Sustainable Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender inclusion (SAPLING) chicken value chain activities in Ethiopia is to test and avail high-producing, farmer-preferred chicken genotypes to enhance smallholder chicken productivity (in terms of eggs and meat yield). Three genetically improved candidate chicken strains (Sasso, Koekoek and Bovans Brown) have been identified for performance evaluation and scaling under on-farm conditions. The TPGS team at ILRI, agricultural research institutions, and bureaus in Amhara, Oromia, South Ethiopia, and Central Ethiopia regions have partnered to implement these activities. Doyogena performance testing site (PTS) falls in the Central Ethiopia Region, while another PTS at Konso falls within South Ethiopia Region. The two PTSs in Amhara Region are located at Bahir Dar Zuria and Menz Gera. Within Oromia Region, the SAPLING chicken interventions are implemented at Welmera and Berek. In total, SAPLING chicken value chain activities are being implemented in six districts across four regions of Ethiopia.   Target farmers lack the skills needed to keep improved chicken strains and desired levels of productivity and positive changes on livelihoods cannot be achieved unless they receive training prior to project intervention.  The trainings organized for farmers and reported in this document are linked with planned activities of SAPLING in work package (WP)1 — Technologies and practices for sustainable livestock productivity and WP4 — Competitive and inclusive livestock value chains; and WP5 — Evidence, decisions, and scaling.  In WP1, they contribute to identification and promotion of productive and tropically-adapted chicken breeds and help integrate genetics with flock health and feeds. Regarding to WP4, key stakeholders and value chain actors were invited, and opportunities and challenges discussed at community level. Discussions were held with value chain actors as a preliminary step to the scaling process. Training on type of breeds that will be disseminated to farmers and their production requirements, improved chicken housing construction and management, improved feed formulation and feeding practices, chicken health management and market linkages was given to on-farm participating farmers in each PTS. Location and modality Selected participants from the four regions of Ethiopia attended the trainings. The participants included district livestock extension and chicken health experts, community leaders, input supplies and service providers, and village administration. Each performance testing site comprised participants from three SAPLING villages (kebeles). The trainings were provided face-to-face. They targeted farmers who take part in on-farm chicken performance testing of improved breeds, and the livestock experts who provide them support services in the project areas. In total 984 participants, including 700 farmers from 6 SAPLING PTSs (constituting 18 target villages) attended the training. Dates of trainings The trainings were organized at different times across performance testing sites in the four regions. In Amhara Region, the trainings were provided between 24–26 February at Menz Gera; and 7–9 March at Bahir Dar Zuria in the year 2023. In Oromia Region, the trainings were provided between 27 April and 30 May at Welmera; and 30 April and 5 May at Berek. In Central Ethiopia Region, the training was provided between 26 and 30 March 2023 at Doyogena. In South Ethiopia, the training was conducted between 21 and 24 May 2023 at Konso.

 3 Who conducted the training The training was given by researchers from the national research system and chicken experts at district offices of agriculture. Partnering institutions included Andassa Livestock Research Centre (ALRC) of the Amhara Region Agricultural Research Institute (ARARI), Holetta Agricultural Research Centre (HARC) of Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR), and Arba Minch and Areka Agricultural Research Centres of Southern Agricultural Research Institute (SARI). Objectives of the training The objectives of these trainings were to build the capacity of smallholder farmers on improved chicken management and production practices and to engage chicken value chain actors. Training agenda  Training of farmers and agricultural experts The trainings aimed at improving the knowledge of farmers on improved chicken husbandry and creating awareness to key chicken value chain actors in program intervention areas about planned chicken interventions. The value chain actors received orientation about SAPLING activities.   The training agendas included the design of the on-farm chicken performance test and expectations from key actors, chicken breeding, feeding, health and housing. After training the participant farmers acquired the skill needed to construct new chicken houses or renovate existing ones and learned how to formulate feeds from locally available resources to supplement their chickens. The chicken health training focused on hygienic practices and ways to prevent diseases.   The content of the training is presented below.  • Chicken housing: design, construction of walls and floor, ventilation, equipment to be fulfilled in the chicken house (e.g., feeders, waterers, laying nest), protection of chickens from predators. • Chicken feeds and feeding management: feed formulation from locally available resources, nutrient requirements for growth and egg production, managing costs. • Chicken health: biosecurity, prevention, and control of diseases. • Participating in SAPLING chicken interventions: design of the present research and development intervention, selection of sites and farmers, roles and responsibilities of actors (farmers, enumerators, agricultural experts, researchers), linkage with input and service providers.  Training of farmers and agricultural experts in Amhara Region Farmers, livestock experts, input, and support service providers from Bahir Dar Zuria and Menz Gera districts (chicken performance testing sites) of Amhara Region attended the training organized at their respective districts.   A total of 432 farmers, 6 kebele administrators, 12 kebele livestock experts , 6 kebele animal health experts, 10 district livestock officers (process owners, breeding experts, feed and nutrition experts and health experts), 2 district agricultural and rural development officers, and 6 enumerators participated in the training. From the total participants 46.6% of them were females (Table 1).

Unfortunately, the excessive exploitation of these lands, involving overgrazing and wood cutting, has resulted in their deterioration and diminished productivity. Acknowledging the imperative for rehabilitation, the General Directorate of Forests (DGF) and the Office of Livestock and Pastures (OEP) are actively involved in restoration projects. Nonetheless, persistent challenges, particularly concerning the availability and quality of indigenous plant seeds and seedlings in public nurseries, pose obstacles to successful implementation. In response, the Livestock and Climate OneCGIAR initiative, specifically through its Work Package Three (WP3), is dedicated to enhancing the capacity of partners. To this end, ICARDA has organized a training course aimed at bolstering the skills and capacities of stakeholders engaged in rangeland rehabilitation. The course, covering seed management, nursery operations, and field visits, employs a participatory approach and collaborative learning, with the ultimate objective of empowering participants to adeptly handle indigenous plant seeds and cultivate healthy seedlings. The target beneficiaries encompass staff from DGF, OEP, and other development agencies, along with researchers and community-based organizations. Facilitated by Dr. Azaiez Ouled Belgacem, Dr. Sawsan Hassan, and Dr. Mounir Louhaichi, the training successfully engaged 33 participants, fostering a cohesive and knowledgeable team by the program's conclusion.

1. Background  
Pastoral and silvopastoral lands are one of the most important natural resources in Tunisia, covering a 
significant area and contributing significantly to the livestock feed requirements, which amount to around 
30% in a normal year.  However, overexploitation of rangelands (overgrazing, early grazing, wood cutting, 
etc.) has led to their deterioration and low productivity. Both the General Directorate of Forests (DGF) and 
Office of Livestock and Pastures (OEP) have therefore prioritized actions geared at rehabilitation, 
development, and sustainable management  of the rangelands . 
To reach this goal, many rangeland restoration rehabilitation projects and programs are underway. While 
public nurseries play a crucial role in providing access to a diverse range of plant species , the availability of 
seeds and seedlings of indigenous species in these nurseries, combined with concerns about the quality of 
seedlings, presents a significant challenge in efforts implementation. This situation hinders endeavors to 
promote local ecosystems and their associated benefits and has resulted in the failur e of many rangeland 
rehabilitation projects. This failure often stems from the use of exotic species, such as Acacia saligna  (syn. 
cyanophylla ) due to their high ecological demands and often their competitive behavior in addition to their 
either low palata bility or nutritive value. This requires a reliable supply of native range shrub and tree seeds 
and seedlings and calls for capacity for seed collection, processing, storage, transportation, and the 
production of healthy seedlings. Recognizing that the qua lity of seeds and seedlings serves as the 
cornerstone of rehabilitation programs, determining successful post -planting survival and development, 
underscores the significance of prioritizing these aspects in our restoration initiatives. Effectively 
addressi ng this gap needs a comprehensive approach, involving collaboration between nurseries, 
conservation organizations, and local communities.  
To produce quality seeds and seedlings, Tunisia requires manpower with the necessary knowledge and 
skills.  To address this need, ICARDA organized a course within the framework of Work Package Three (WP3) 
Page 5:
 
Capacity Development Report  
5 | P a g e  of the Livestock and Climate OneCGIAR initiative (LCSR). WP3 focuses on system -level research and 
interventions aimed at building resilient, low -emission livestock production systems. Specifically, the work 
package prioritizes the development of climate -related resilience in livestock agrifood systems. This 
involves promoting resilient, socially inclusive governance of land and natural resources, ensuring the 
engagement of all relevant stakeholders in land -use planning. Activities such as regenerative lives tock 
practices and initiatives to enhance the effective integration of trees play a pivotal role in reversing 
degradation and restoring land, particularly in rangelands. The approach places a strong emphasis on 
strengthening the appropriate integration of trees throughout the entire process. The course, designed to 
strengthen the capacity of development agencies at both national and local levels, aligns with this broader 
goal by contributing to rangeland rehabilitation efforts. Its focus is on building the capacity to effectively 
manage indigenous plant seeds and produce healthy seedlings.

9.1.2.  Presentation session  
Dr. Azaiez initiated the session by addressing the challenges and opportunities surrounding Indigenous 
rangeland and silvopastoral seeds in the MENA region, emphasizing their pivotal role. He underscored 
these areas as fundamental fodder sources for livest ock, vital contributors to pastoral community income, 
and significant drivers of the national economy. Notably, they function as vital hubs for environmental 
conservation, nurturing various wild plants, including medicinal and aromatic species. He stressed  their 
strategic significance in combatting climate -induced stresses and agricultural pests.  
Yet, within this critical landscape, challenges surfaced. The deteriorating condition of natural vegetation, 
the struggle to acclimate introduced species to harsh environments, and the complexities in gathering 
seeds from local species were notable concern s. The rising interest in native species stems from their 
resilience, efficiency in resource utilization, and the imperative to preserve genetic heritage for sustainable 
development.  
Dr. Azaiez emphasized the profound impact of pastoral seeds on rural development and desertification 
combat. However, challenges persist in the seed sector, such as limited variety, inadequate adaptation to 
diverse environmental conditions, and substantial  gaps in scientific data.  
His recommendations included a SWOT analysis, outlining strengths like existing infrastructure and the 
growing support for afforestation. Identified weaknesses ranged from limited knowledge to waning 
interest in local species. The opportunities revealed a burgeoning demand and the potential for awareness 
initiatives. Threats were notable, encompassing budget constraints, lack of experienced technicians, 
grazing pressures, and inadequate community involvement in vegetation programs.

of the Seed Service section within the training. This sector entails a myriad of responsibilities, including 
Page 10:
 
Capacity Development Report  
10 | P a g e  oversight of seed harvests in designated areas, continuous management of seed populations, and 
procurement of seeds from exotic arboretum species. The focus lies on upholding established standards 
for tree selection, coordinating the collection of seeds fr om valuable pastoral plants, managing seed stocks, 
treatment, analysis, supply to forest nurseries, and short to medium -term seed preservation. The 
comprehensive process involves on -site visits for harvest, identification of seed -bearing trees, operational  
planning for harvest, seed drying, collection, transportation to central hubs, temporary storage, and final 
delivery to the seed service. Noteworthy species harvested encompass acacia, pine, casuarina, carob, 
assorted pastoral species, and eucalyptus.   Mr. Soufian highlighted Tunisia's rich biodiversity, housing a 
diverse array of species highly valued for their nutritional benefits and varying preferences among Tunisian 
livestock. This diverse spectrum serves as an ideal resource for pastoral use. Speci es like Ceratonia siliqua , 
Colutea atlantica, Acacia tortilis , and Medicago arborea  exhibit unique adaptations enabling them to thrive 
across the varied landscapes of Tunisia.  
However, identified challenges encompass the identification of pastoral species, immature seed 
harvesting, low germination rates, and limited or moderate seed quantities, necessitating attention. Proper 
species identification before harvesting remains pivo tal. To address this, collecting not only seeds but also 
fruit and leaf samples for botanical identification with specialist assistance is recommended.  Conclusively, 
addressing these challenges stands as a critical factor in ensuring efficient seed managem ent. 
The subsequent session explored the Importance and Viability of Seeds and Techniques of Germination, 
shedding light on critical methods involved in this pivotal agricultural process. Stressing the timeliness of 
seed collection, Dr. Aziez emphasized the sig nificance of gathering seeds right before their natural 
dispersal, leveraging visual indicators of their varying maturity. To assist this, a comprehensive schedule of 
indigenous rangeland and silvopastoral species, along with their specific maturity dates,  was provided to 
enhance accurate collection timing. Dr. Aziez detailed various methods for seed collection, distinguishing 
between manual and mechanical techniques based on seed size and type. The presentation emphasized 
key stages of seed preparation, en compassing both natural and mechanical drying methods to preserve 
seed quality. Furthermore, Dr. Aziez explained the use of manual and mechanical threshers to process 
collected seeds efficiently and detailed subsequent cleaning processes to ensure high -quality seeds for 
storage. The significance of treatments, especially regarding moisture and temperature control, was 
highlighted for effective seed conservation. Finally, the presentation concluded with a comprehensive 
exhibit of machinery types critical in seed collection, cleaning, threshing, and essential treatments, 
providing an in -depth understanding of machinery's role in this crucial agricultural process.  
This was followed by a presentation on Seed Germination and Factors Impacting Seed Germination, 
exploring the vital processes involved in seed testing and germination. Dr. Aziez highlighted the pivotal role 
of seed tests, specifically focusing on purity an d physiological evaluations. Purity tests aim to determine 
seed quality by identifying contaminants such as inert matter, other crop seeds, or weed seeds. The 
presentation detailed the methods used to assess seed purity, emphasizing the importance of achie ving a 
safe seed percentage for optimal crop growth. The session navigated through the intricate steps of seed 
germination, emphasizing the significant influence of external factors. Factors such as water, light, and 
temperature were discussed for their pr ofound impact on seed germination. Additionally, the correlation

However, widespread overexploitation, including overgrazing and wood cutting, has led to degradation and reduced productivity. To address this, a training initiative focused on rangeland survey, management, and restoration was conducted under the Livestock and Climate Initiative of OneCGIAR. The objective was to enhance the capacity of engineers and technical staff from relevant institutions.
The training covered two main themes: rangeland condition survey using modern technology like the Land-Potential Knowledge System (LandPKS) app and traditional methods, and the restoration of degraded rangelands using native species resilient to climate change. Participants learned to assess vegetation cover, composition, and soil conditions using the LandPKS app, Line-Point Intercept, and quadrat methods.
Key outcomes included the successful application of the LandPKS app, allowing for sustainable land management decisions. The course also addressed challenges in rangeland restoration, such as the lack of high-palatability seeds and the need for effective laws and regulations. The importance of community participation and adaptation to climate change was emphasized.
The training engaged stakeholders and discussed restoration techniques tailored to the level of degradation, suggesting rehabilitation as a preferred response when irreversibility thresholds are crossed. The focus was on reintroducing native species and improving soil conditions. The case study involved a severely degraded site invaded by sand dunes, necessitating the selection of suitable native species to stabilize dunes and provide livestock feed.

Rangelands are among the most crucial natural resources in Tunisia, covering an area of 
approximately 5.5 million hectares. Of this total, 87% is located in arid and desert regions, 
with 45% in the south and 42% in the desert areas. These rangelands contri bute to at least 
30% of the livestock feed requirements. Unfortunately, in recent decades, overexploitation, 
including overgrazing, early grazing, and wood cutting, has led to their deterioration and 
reduced productivity. All stakeholders are now aware of this alarming situation and are 
focused on rehabilitating, developing, and managing grazing.  
The process of conducting vegetation cover surveys and determining carrying capacity is 
crucial for understanding the condition and trends of rangelands. This information is essential 
for developing strategies and programs aimed at rehabilitation and ratio nal management. In 
this context, research and development institutions aim to enhance the capacities of their 
staff, ensuring their active participation in various activities.  
Within the framework of implementing the Livestock and Climate Initiative of the OneCGIAR, 
on-the-job training related to the restoration and sustainable management of communal 
rangelands was held in the Dhahar of Beni Khedache and Douz rangelands on Novem ber 1 -2, 
2023 . 
 
Objective  
 
The objective of this on -the-job training is to enhance and build the capacity of the Engineers 
and technical staff involved in rangeland survey, management , and development from 
institutional partners and stakeholders.  
 
Beneficiaries  
The beneficiaries of this training course were the staff of the Commissariat Régional au 
Développement Agricole (CRDA – Medenine and Kebili ), the Office of Livestock and Pastures 
(OEP), Institut des Régions Arides (IRA – Medenine), and the community -based organizations 
(both Agricultural Development Groups :GDAs  of Dhahar Beni Khedache and Dhahar Douz).

Page 4 of 17  Participants may have limited or no prior experience or training in vegetation cover survey 
and management skills. The course follows a general approach and is designed for 
participants with diverse educational backgrounds. A total of 13 participants atten ded both 
training sessions, including 4 from the CRDA of Medenine and Kebili, 1 from the OEP Kebili, 3 
from IRA, and 5 from the GDAs of Dhahar Beni Khedache (2) and Douz (3). Among the trainees, 
4 ladies attended the training. The attendance sheet is attac hed as an annex for reference .  
Training Methodology:  
 
Upon request of the stakeholders and within the framework of the baseline study, two main 
themes were considered in this on -the-job training:  
- Rangeland condition survey: quantitative methods of determining the vegetation 
cover attributes, (cover, species composition, plant density, biomass production, …) 
using modern technology and IT application ( Land -Potential Knowledge System ) as 
well the well -common classic techniques;  
- Restoration of degraded rangeland ecosystems using native species with a focus on 
those showing better resilience towards climate change and well adapted to harsh 
environment of southern Tunisia.   
 
Vegetation cover attributes and soil surface states survey  
Participants were trained on vegetation cover parameter  measurements and field data 
collection , using the following methods:  
1. Land -Potential Knowledge System (LandPKS) application  
Within this training program, participants explored the LandPKS application and its role in 
surveying rangeland vegetation cover and soil characteristics (Figure 1) . They installed the 
application on their mobile phones and began collecting and filling data on soils, climate, 
topography, and vegetation. The application facilitates the identification of land cover types, 
including tree cover, shrublands, and grassland s, enabling the development of customized 
land management strategies. It also helps distingui sh between grazed and non -grazed land 
uses, assisting in the assessment of land degradation risks associated with various animal 
species.  
Page 5:
 
On the Job Training  Report  
Page 5 of 17  Furthermore, the app offers slope and slope shape analysis to assess susceptibility to soil 
erosion, highlighting soil conditions like deep cracks and salt accumulation that indicate 
potential growth constraints for plant species. Additionally, the assessm ent of soil layers, 
including texture and rock content, informs decisions related to water infiltration, holding 
capacity, and erosion risk. Collectively, these functions empower land managers to make 
informed, sustainable choices, ultimately enhancing lan d health.  
 
The staff of CRDA and OEP particularly appreciated the tool, as it will help them make more 
sustainable land management decisions.  
 
Figure 1. Landpkd Application . 
The training focused on vegetation cover, including aspects such as cover, structure, and 
utilization. Trainees learned to use the LandPKS Vegetation Module, which allows for rapid 
data collection and monitoring of various vegetation attributes, including composition, cover, 
height, basal/canopy gaps, and species density  (Figure 2) . The module simplifies vegetation 
cover assessment using a 1 -meter stick and a point -intercept method, providing cover trend 
graphs over time for user -friendly interpretation.

2. Line point intercept and quadrats methods  
The design we used in the traing  is summarized in Figure  3. 
 
  
In each sampling area, the design 
comprises: i) 3 lines of 100  m each serving 
for measuring the total vegetation cover, 
species composition and soil surface states; 
ii) 5 quadrats of 20  m2 each for determining 
the density of perennial plants and iii) 10 
quadrats of 1  m2 each for determining the 
density of annual plants.  
Figure 3. Design for Measuring Plant Cover and Species Composition Using the Line -Point 
Intercept Method and Quadrats for Plant Density . 
 
 
2.1. Line-Point Intercept  
The Line Point Intercept (LPI) method was utilized to determine total vegetation cover, 
species composition, and soil surface states (bare soil, litter, rocks, sand, crust, etc.). In other 
words, the procedure involves lowering a sampling pin or rod through th e vegetation at 
regular intervals along a set of transects in each plot. The first plant species intercepted 
vertically in its path or the type of ground cover, if not intercepted by plants, is recorded.  
Page 7:
 
On the Job Training  Report  
Page 7 of 17  Initially, the different tools required for the measurements were introduced to the 
participants: two 50 -meter length tapes, thin gauged pins, a hammer, stakes, LPI data forms, 
clipboard, etc. The number of replications of the transects to be considered wa s also 
presented and discussed. It was agreed that, for a given measurement and regardless of the 
state of the vegetation cover, the transects should be replicated until reaching 100 points of 
vegetation contacted by the thin gauged pin.  
In the training, At each line, t wo participants (1 reader, and 1 recorder) made  the survey . At 
each observation point, the reader follows the needle -sighting  line into the vegetation and 
announces the observation point and the list of elements found there. This involves either 
plant species, of which at least one organ should touch the needle, or elements on the ground 
(litter, bare soil, rough elements, basal vegetation, etc.) touched by the point of the needle 
as it arrives on the ground. The second observer records the information on a pre -established 
record form. Note that the measurements are more precise on days when there is no win d, 
Additionally, partic ipants collected soil samples at depths of 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm, and 
combined them to create composite samples for each depth  (Figure 4).  
Figure 4. Participants Collecting Data Using the Line Point Intercept (LPI) Method Along with 
Soil Sampling .  
 
2.2. The quadrats  
2.2.1.  Minimal area  
If the size of the quadrat used to count the number or cut the biomass of annual vegetation 
is generally small, sometimes even less than 1  m2, the concept of minimal area becomes 
Page 8:
 
On the Job Training  Report  
Page 8 of 17  crucial for estimating species richness, plant density, and biomass production in arid areas. 
This is particularly important in determining quadrat size, especially for perennial species.  
The distribution of plant and soil elements is usually very irregular in arid and desert zones, 
rendering the notion of homogeneity difficult to address. Among these difficulties is the 
determination of the number of measurements to take for each site base d on the calculation 
of the confidence interval applied to acquired data. In arid zones, one must accept relative 
reliability for the averages obtained, for example, with standing plant density and biomass 
measurement values. These are among the data showi ng the greatest spatial heterogeneity 
and for which the number of measurement plots rapidly attains a size incompatible with what 
is possible at the level of observation.   
The concept of area -species relations allows for control of vegetation representativeness. It 
is based on the probability that a species will be present in a portion of the space studied. 
Consequently, the surface considered to be representative serves as a model adapted to the 
type of vegetation, considering the frequency of each recorded species. The representative 
minimal area of the vegetation present is a major characteristic of each type of environmental 
unit.   
Within a unit considered homogeneous and sufficiently spread out, a certain number of 
stations where the survey s will be made are randomly chosen. The mechanism is 
implemented gradually. The survey  involves establishing the floristic list on progressively 
larger plots, with the surface area doubling at each stage, e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 m2, etc. 
Practically, doubling the area is stopped when about 80% of the site species are recorded 
(Figure 5). 
 
Page 9:
 
On the Job Training  Report  
Page 9 of 17   The principle consists of the following steps:  
1: list the species present in the first 1m2 
2: double the area (2  m2) and list the new species (absent in 
the first square)  
3: double the area (4  m2) and list the new species (absent in 
the previous squares)  
4: double the area (8  m2) and list the new species (absent in 
the previous squares)  
5: double the area (16  m2) and list the new species (absent in 
the previous squares)  
6: double the area ( 32 m2) and list the new species (absent in 
the previous squares)   
7 double the area ( 64 m2) and list the new species (absent in 
the previous squares)  
8: double the area (128  m2) and list the new species (absent in 
the previous squares)  
9: double the area ( 256 m2) and list the new species (absent in 
the previous squares)  
Minimum area = 256  m2 if no new species is recorded when 
doubling the area  
Figure 5. Mechanism for increasing surface areas to determine the minimal area   
The sum of species found at each stage permits  to establishment  the species -area curve. If 
the environment is homogeneous, the number of species being added to the list progressively 
falls to zero. From this graph, the point of inflection  of the curve of new taxa acquisition 
should determine the minimal area (the surface measured in m2) for this survey . In practice, 
it is often necessary to take measurements on surface areas that are double the minimal area 
established. The minimal area will be very important to determine the number of quadrats 
used to estimate species  density and above -ground  biomass. For example, if the minimal area 
is equal to 32 m2, the number of quadrats per sampling area will be at least 4, with each 
having an area of 8 m2. 
2.2.2.  Plant density  
Plant density  is the number of individuals or stems of each species per unit area . The number 
of individuals of each perennial species were counted in each of the 5 quadrats of 20  m2 each. 
However, the annual species were accounted in ten 1  m2 quadrats ( Figure 3). 
2.2.3.  Biomass Estimation  
The total dry weight equivalent of plant matter per unit area is known as the plant biomass. 
Not all the plant biomass is available as feed for animals. Plant biomass varies greatly between 
seasons and years even in the absence of grazing or other forms of use.  There are two 
methods for estimating above -ground  biomass - the destructive which consists of direct 
clipping or the semi -destructive  method  which does not involve clipping .  
 
Page 10:
 
On the Job Training  Report  
Page 10 of 17   
For our training case, we used the destructive method which is the most accurate although it 
is hard and time -consuming. Range biomass production was estimated by harvesting the 
vegetation inside five quadrats of 1 0 m2 each for annual species, and by clipping half of the 
potentially grazeable biomass (according to the rule take half and leave half) of ten tufts of 
each species for perennial vegetation. The total biomass of perennial species was estimated 
by multiplying the mean available biomass per individ ual by the density of the species. The 
clipped plants were weighed immediately  (after that samples were oven -dried for 48 h at 
65°C in the laboratory for estimation of dry matter content (DM) . 
 
Restoration of degraded rangeland ecosystems  
During the last decades, complex political, social, and environmental factors and 
management practices have degraded large areas of rangeland, this calls into question 
rangelands’ long -term sustainability under current usage practices. The major causes of 
rangeland  degradation, habitat change, and biodiversity loss are the conversion of natural 
ecosystems to farmland, exploitation through selective grazing, fuel wood removal, charcoal 
production, and livestock overgrazing. Disturbances caused by these activ ities and, by climate 
change, influence ecosystem dynamics, structure, and composition. On the other hand , 
rangelands rehabilitation and management are facing several challenges and constraints, the 
main are:  
▪ The protection can be efficient only if the vegetation cover keeps its resilience and the key 
range species are rarefied and do not disappear. Long -term  protection may lead to the aging 
of the plants and the extension of the crust. Short -term protection (rest) is acceptable by the 
pastoral communities.  
▪ Most of the plant species used in the rehabilitation operations have low palatability. This 
may be attributed to the lack of seeds from high -palatability rangeland species. The 
establishment of a seed production system by the newly created National Center for 
Vegetation Cover and Combating Desertification will address this problem . 
▪ Some of the reasons for the ongoing deterioration of rangelands and the lack of progress in 
their rehabilitation and sustainable management are attributed to the ineffective application 
Page 11:
 
On the Job Training  Report  
Page 11 of 17  of rangeland and forestry laws and their regulations. To address this, there is a need for an 
integrated monitoring system that can enhance the application of these laws, reduce abuses, 
and halt offending activities aimed at protecting and developing range lands. The creation of 
an Environmental Police force may help overcome this problem . 
▪ Communication and coordination among the various institutions serving and supporting 
grasslands in rangeland regions have been weak, with pastoral communities rarely being 
consulted when projects are first formulated. Consequently, most past efforts aimed at the 
development of these spaces have been predominantly technical, lacking consideration for 
social aspects such as tribal rules and land tenure . In the present era, with decentralization 
and local empowerment gaining momentum, community participation can no longer be 
ignored . 
▪ Rangeland ecosystems in dry areas, including southern Tunisia, are sensitive to climate 
changes. Climate change intensifies the negative impacts of drought on rangeland vegetation, 
leading to low levels of emergence of annual species, changes in phenology and reproduction 
timing, reduced biodiversity, low plant cover, and a decline in the productive capacity of 
past oral systems. Climatic changes may also contribute to water resource shortages, 
widespread land degradation, and increased desertification. These threats have the potential 
to negatively impact rangeland biodiversity, the life cycle of plants, and crop/liv estock 
productivity. Overall, climate change poses a significant risk to the resilience of rangeland 
ecosystems .  
During this ongoing on -the-job training, we engaged with various stakeholders, including the 
GDAs and community representatives, discussing concepts and main techniques of 
restoration and rehabilitation that can be adopted to enhance pastoral productivity in the 
selected rangeland sites.  
In this present on-the-job training, we engaged with all stakeholders, including the GDAs and 
community representatives, discussing concepts and the main techniques of restoration and 
rehabilitation that can be adopted to improve pastoral productivity in the selected rang eland 
sites . 
 
 
Page 12:
 
On the Job Training  Report  
Page 12 of 17   
Depending on the stage of degradation reached, several techniques have been developed 
and practiced in different countries of the MENA region to enhance the ecosystem resilience 
of rangeland in the face of disturbance and stress factors and improve its pro ductivity. Figure 
6 presents the general model describing the ecosystem degradation process to help decide 
when restoration, rehabilitation, or reallocation should be the preferred response. The latter 
two pathways are suggested when one or more 'threshold s of irreversibility' have been 
crossed in the course of ecosystem degradation and when 'passive' restoration to a presumed 
pre-disturbing condition is deemed impossible .  
 
Figure 6. A schematic representation of the general model depicting rangeland ecosystem 
degradation and three potential development options (adapted from Aronson et al., 1993).  
In our case and within the experimental site we visited with the trainees, the rangeland 
degradation reaches the threshold of irreversibility  and we presented some indicators such 
as lack of  seeds in the soil and the reconstitution of the ecosystem by a simple restoration is 
no longer possible, the rehabilitation by reintroduction of the native range species having 
disappeared and/or improving the soil conditions (scarification, water harvesting techniques, 
etc.) become the only alternative to improve the productivity  of the rangeland ecosystem to 
be comparable to the initially existing one.

Page 13 of 17  Since the site of the training was severely degraded and invaded by sand mobile dunes, we 
have largely selected the most suitable native range species that can first stabilize the dunes 
and secondly constitute a source of feed for the community livestock g razing.

 Conclusion   
Tunisia's rangelands, essential for sustaining livestock and biodiversity, have faced the 
detrimental effects of overexploitation, signaling an urgent need for rehabilitation and 
sustainable management. The recently conducted on -the-job training emerged as a pivotal 
initiative, fostering collaboration, knowledge exchange, and practical insights  into the 
intricacies of effective rangeland management.  
 
This training, centered on crucial themes such as quantitative rangeland surveys and 
ecosystem restoration, harnessed a blend of modern technology, exemplified by the Land -
Potential Knowledge System (LandPKS) application, and time -tested traditional method s. 
Participants, drawn from diverse institutions, gained proficiency in conducting vegetation 
cover surveys, soil surface assessments, and biomass estimations. The laudable integration of 
the LandPKS application garnered praise for its potential to revolut ionize sustainable land

stewardship.  
The emphasis on vegetation cover, spanning aspects of cover, structure, and utilization, was 
reinforced by the practical application of techniques like the Line Point Intercept (LPI) method 
and quadrats. The incorporation of the minimal area concept within  the quadrats method 
underscored the training's commitment to obtaining accurate estimates of species richness, 
plant density, and biomass production, particularly vital in arid environments.  
The collaborative pledge to implement sustainable practices, fortify protective measures, and 
amplify community engagement is pivotal for fortifying the resilience and vitality of Tunisia's 
rangelands. This training represents a significant stride towards a future where these vital 
ecosystems not only endure but thrive harmoniously with the needs of communities and the 
broader ecosystem.

Silvopastoral systems represent a harmonious and integrated land management strategy that 
combines the cultivation of trees or shrubs with livestock grazing. Based on the synergy 
between forestry and animal husbandry, silvopastoralism aims to optimize the use of 
available land resources while adopting sustainable agricultural practices. In this system, trees 
and shrubs serve dual roles as providers of essential forage for grazing animals and 
contributors to ecological health. The integration of vegetation w ith pasturelands not only 
addresses the nutritional needs of livestock but also contributes to soil conservation, 
biodiversity enhancement, and carbon sequestration. Silvopastoral systems are suitable for 
diverse environmental conditions, demonstrating ada ptability to various climates and 
landscapes. As a model of agroecological balance, these systems illustrate the potential for 
sustainable harmony between agriculture and forestry, offering a pattern for resilient and 
environmentally conscious land use.  
In silvopastoral systems, trees play a versatile and pivotal role in enhancing both agricultural 
and environmental outcomes. Adapted trees, carefully selected to grow in specific climatic 
and soil conditions, contribute significantly to the sustainability of these systems. Their 
primary function lies in providing a renewable source of forage for grazing animals, offering 
nutritious leaves, pods, or browse that supplement the livestock's diet. Beyond their role as 
a fodder source, trees act as natural shelte rs, providing shade and protection to livestock, 
particularly in arid or extreme weather conditions. Moreover, the root systems of adapted 
trees play a crucial role in soil conservation, preventing erosion and enhancing water 
retention.  
Furthermore, trees contribute to the livelihoods of farmers through a diverse collection of 
benefits. Fruit trees in these systems not only enhance the nutritional value of the human's 
diet but also present an additional source of income for farmers throug h the sale of fruits. 
Furthermore, certain tree species with medicinal properties offer valuable resources for 
traditional healthcare, serving as a natural pharmacy within the agroecosystem. Additionally, 
the presence of flowering trees contributes to bee production, facilitating honey production 
and apiculture activities.

Page 4 of 15  This interaction between adapted trees and the overall ecosystem highlights their significance 
in adopting sustainable land management practices, where agricultural productivity and 
environmental conservation go hand in hand.  
Within silvopastoral systems in Tunisia, a variety of tree species play a crucial role in bolstering 
the agricultural and environmental objectives of these integrated land management 
strategies. Adapted to the specific climatic and soil conditions of the r egion, carefully selected 
tree species in Tunisian silvopastoral systems  contributes to the broader goals of 
environmental preservation and community livelihoods.  
The genus Ziziphus belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and comprise s about 170 species 
distributed in tropics and subtropics regions of the world. They are well known by their 
economic and medicinal importance. Several species of Ziziphus were used in traditional 
medicine and in treatment of various diseases.  
The genus Ziziphus is notably diverse in Tunisia, comprising three species, each contributing 
significantly to the ecological and economic landscape of the region. Among these, Ziziphus 
lotus stands as a native species, deeply rooted in Tunisia's natural e nvironment. Additionally, 
the introduced species Ziziphus spina -christi  and Ziziphus mauritaniana (synonymous with 
jujuba) have integrated into the diverse environmental conditions of the country, exhibiting 
their adaptability over an extended period. Loca lly known as Sidr, both Z. lotus  and Z. spina -
christi , and Ennab for Z. mauritaniana , these species play multiple roles in Tunisia's landscape.  
 
The versatility of these Ziziphus  species extends beyond their native or introduced status, as 
they are recognized for their multipurpose utility. They contribute greatly to environmental 
conservation efforts, actively participating in soil preservation, water conservation, and the 
enhanc ement of biodiversity, exemplifying their role as environmental stewards.  
 
Moreover, the economic impact of these Ziziphus  species is considerable, both at the national 
and local levels. The fruits, leaves, and roots, particularly of the introduced species, hold 
nutritional, cosmetic, and medicinal benefits. This multifunctionality highlights the 
interaction between the conse rvation of natural resources and the sustainable economic 
growth of the region. As these Ziziphus  species continue to demonstrate their adaptability, 
they emerge as invaluable options in Tunisia's plan towards  a balanced and resilient ecological 
and economic landscape.

Awareness -Raising Day Report  
Page 5 of 15  Despite the multiple benefits that Ziziphus species offer, there is a pressing need to raise 
awareness about their importance and proper management. Engaging various stakeholders, 
including farmers, local communities, and policymakers, becomes pivotal in e nsuring the 
sustainable cultivation and utilization of these valuable resources. Educational initiatives 
should emphasize the ecological roles of Ziziphus  in preserving soil, conserving water 
resources, and enhancing biodiversity. Additionally, raising awa reness about the economic 
potential of Ziziphus , especially among farmers, can lead to more sustainable land 
management practices. By promoting a deeper understanding of the multifunctionality, 
benefits, and proper management techniques, farmers and other stakeholders can 
collectively contribute to the use, preservation, and enhancement of Ziziphus species within 
Tunisia's diversified ecological zones.  
Within the framework of the Livestock and Climate Initiative of the OneCGIAR  (LCSR) , the 
National Institute for Research in Rural Engineering, Water and Forestry  (INRGREF) , with the 
support of the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) and 
in co llaboration  with the Hive  Association for Active Citizenship in T ozeur , organized an 
awareness -raising day on the importance of the Ziziphus  tree and its preservation in the 
region of Tozeur ,  southern Tunisia . 
Objectives  
The fied day is intended to achieve the following objectives:  
• Highlight  the importance of the genetic diversity of the ziziphus  species in Tun isia and 
more particularly in Tozeur oasis  
• Underline the environmental and economic importance of the Ziziphus  species  
• Develop and enhance the skills and capacities of the stakeholders of the ziziphus

Several  recommendations have been developed  to ensure the continuity of this awareness 
and the preservation of this important environmental heritage. Below  are the main 
recommendations  of the workshop : 
1. A study on valuing drainage  water in planting Ziziphus tree  trees and establishing a green 
belt:  
- Conducting a comprehensive study on the use of draina ge water in the cultivation of the 
Ziziphus tree  tree.  
- Encouraging the creat ion of a green belt that protects and enhances the growth of the 
Ziziphus tree  tree.  
2. A study on forest and pastoral trees in the Djerid region and their characteristics:  
- Conduct a detailed study on the biological diversity of forest and pastoral trees in the 
Djerid region . 
3. Intensifying guidance and awareness -raising about the importance of the Ziziphus tree  
through developing  effective awareness campaigns to disseminate  information about the 
benefits and importance of the Ziziphus tree  tree.  
4. A study on the characteristics of the Ziziphus tree  tree and its industrial, medical , and 
fodder valuation  through conducting  a comprehensive study on the physical and chemical 
properties of the Ziziphus tree  tree and how to invest it in industry, medicine , and animal 
feeding . 
5. Establishing experimental platforms and field and research schools:  
- Establishing platforms for research and experiments to support innovation and 
knowledge exchange.  
6. Creating new areas for Ziziphus tree  cultivation and encouraging the participation of youth  
within the framework of agricultural projects support .

10. Support scientific research on rangeland species and orienting the support and 
encouragement to scientific research specialized in developing Ziziphus tree  cultivation.  
11. Imposing laws prohibiting the uprooting of the Ziziphus tree  tree 
Conclusion   
The workshop and the meeting with many stakeholders confirmed that we are assisting at a 
loss of the genetic resources of Z iziphus species and the importance of preserving this 
diversity both with protection and with planting the seedlings either in the forest and 
rangeland areas or in the agricultural fields, particularly in the oasis .  
Many recommendations have been developed in light of the discussions made after the 
presentation sessions or in the field  which will permit enhanced  awareness and preserve the 
Ziziphus  tree as an essential part of the environmental diversity in the Djerid region.  
It is noteworthy that this day was not just an awareness -raising event, but rather a 
comprehensive learning experience among and between  the participants.   
We expect that these environmental and awareness activities will be the basis for more 
sustainable events in the future, enhancing awareness of the importance of the Ziziphus tree  
tree and enhancing community participation in preserving the environment and biodiversity.  
Development and conservation projects and effort s (protection, planting) can be suggested 
to allow the expansion of this threatened species. On the other hand, it is necessary to 
encourage the pharmaceutical and/ or cosmetic industry to manufacture products based on  
the Ziziphus  tree. 
Such awareness -raising events and the active participation of the local community should 
continue in the future to enhance  awareness of the importance of the Ziziphus tree  tree and 
contribute  to preserving its environmental diversity and improving the quality of life in the 
region.

GENDER-SENSITIVE NUTRITION TRAININGS IN MAKUENI AND NAKURU: KENYA IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
Ukama Ustawi (UU) is a regional project promoting diversification for resilient agrifood 
systems in East (Kenya) and Southern (Zambia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe) Africa, as part of the One CGIAR Gender Equality Initiative (HER+). In Kenya, the project is being implemented 
in five counties (Nakuru, Makueni, Narok, Embu and Kakamega) by the Kenya Agricultural 
and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), with support from Africa Conservation Tillage Network (ACTN), Cereal Growers Association (CGA) and Ministry of Agriculture - Climate Change Unit. This work targets men, women and young smallholder farmers, with KALRO implementing Work Package 1 (Diversify and Sustainably Intensify) of the 
project aimed at developing and evaluating technologies that will enhance production and 
resilience in maize-based cropping systems. Activities, including conservation agriculture (CA), crop diversification and intensification underway in Nakuru, Makueni, Embu, and Kakamega counties, implemented by KALRO Njoro, Katumani, Embu and Kakamega, 
respectively. 
Under WP 1, Activity 1 proposes developing strategies to improve and foster dietary 
diversification and healthy diets. To achieve this, the HER+ initiative collaborated with UU to provide a gender-sensitive training which is one of the social innovations provided 
through the socio-technical innovation bundles approach. This training was organized in 
two of the counties to train farmers and partners on how gender roles, responsibilities influence diets and nutrition. It focused on why men should be engaged in nutritional activities as we look at intrahousehold decisions made on what to grow and what to eat. Engage the participants on food bias, rituals and customary taboos that influence food 
access and consumption. Lastly, we will also do some product optimization and testing to 
assess participants perception of bean-based products.1. Introduction
2. Objectives of the gender-sensitive training
Training objectives were to:
• Train members of farmer groups on gender-sensitive nutrition.
• Create awareness of the benefits of joint decision-making for better health and wealth.
• Train participants on a balanced diet and link it with food we grow
• Test different bean-based products.

GENDER-SENSITIVE NUTRITION TRAININGS IN MAKUENI AND NAKURU: KENYA IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
5.1 What is gender-sensitive nutrition
This interactive session, shown in Figure 1, aimed to obtain the community’s perception 
or understanding of gender, nutrition, and gender-sensitive nutrition. It involved questions on who buys food, sources of food (farm, market/shop), who prepares food, who decides 
what to grow and cook, and the different types of food bought or otherwise sourced by 
different people in the household. From the above questions, it became clear that men and women have different roles and responsibilities relating to food access and preparation. It centred on who decides where food is grown, sourced and consumed and how this affects household diets, nutrition and health. Discussions also touched on food taboos, rituals 
and religious obligations.

To emphasize the importance of paying attention to gender in nutrition, a short drama 
on the need for joint visioning and decision-making was enacted by the gender expert at the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT. This drama was illustrated through three voluntary 
participants. The idea is to have a couple and an outsider. The outsider would love or envy 
the couple and want to break them up (Figure 2).  If the couple works together, they are like two sticks combined compared to one stick for the outsider. So, each volunteer was asked to break the single and double stick. The single stick was easily broken, but the double stick could not be broken. This symbolized that outsiders could easily influence 
a couple where each person did things independently. The doubled stick bundled stick 5. Training

could not be broken, and it symbolized a united couple that made all family decisions with 
little outside interference, leading to increased productivity and better decision on farm, health and nutrition.

A list of the foods available in the community was compiled. This was to create awareness in trainees and trainers about the diversity and accessibility of food to families in the communities and aided the nutritionist when talking about balanced diets and diversity in 
the different communities. The effect of seasonality on the availability of certain foods and 
family nutrition was discussed. 
5.2 Role play on meals and diets
We enacted a role play to showcase food quality and quantity across diverse household types. This role play also shows what different individuals in different households consider to be a balanced diet or healthy food for the households. We also saw that socio-economic 
factors also played a role in the food often bought and consumed in diverse households.

Three volunteers were invited to participate in the role-play. These volunteers were often 
two women and a man. In most cases, we had a variant of married women, single women or elderly and younger women and men who were widowers or single. Different foods/
products were availed (Figure 4). The three were requested to pick (“shop for”) items they 
preferred in order to prepare a family meal.

Each was free to select the foods/products they wished to prepare for their family during 
lunch. The items were placed on three manila-labeled papers according to those who constituted the family. We limited the categories to husband, wife and children, as shown 
below in Figure 5.

Each volunteer freely made their food choices and arranged these on the papers. Food 
used to prepare the meals, like oil, onion, tomatoes, maize or wheat flour, was placed at the centre. Other items split equally between the family might also be placed in the middle. 
The rest were shared by placing them in the respective papers allocated for each family 
member (Figures 6 and 7).

Trainees then moved around to see the choices made by the volunteers, as shown in 
Figures 8, 9, 10). Each volunteer described the meal chosen, the proportions served and the reasons behind their choices. The session involved open and free discussions, 
questions, and answers on why a particular food was chosen servings (type and portion) 
for each gender.

5.3  What’s a balanced diet – men, women, children, pregnant 
women, children under five, and the elderly. 
The nutritionist took over and explained which of the volunteer’s choices was better and 
why. What was needed to improve the choices to be more nutritious? Issues on food taboos relating to transition rituals and pregnant women were discussed.

Pregnant women, children under five years, and the elderly are often disadvantaged and 
vulnerable when it comes to nutrition in the family. Proper attention is required to ensure they get the required quantity and quality of food to meet their nutrition requirements. 
A nutritionist (Figure 11, 12) facilitated this session. The nutritionist was guided by the 
choices of food made by the volunteers and the resulting discussions, together with the knowledge of the types of food available in the area. Emphasis was made on nutrition requirements for pregnant and breast-feeding women, children under the age of five years 
and the elderly.

5.4 Tasting and ranking of value-added bean products
Beans are an important part of a nutritious family diet. The Nyota variety is preferred for 
household use due to its high iron and zinc content. Various products prepared with and without the addition of Nyota bean value-added flour were prepared and displayed for 
organoleptic tasting and ranking (Figure 13).

6.1 Gender-sensitive nutrition
Joint planning by the family was found to be important to reduce influence from outsiders 
and consequent failure of planned farm and food activities. It was also important for the family to know what is essential for their diets and to plan together. Sometimes, the food 
consumed had little or no nutritive value depending on the socio-economic categories 
of the decision-maker in the household. Relatives could assist those who lived alone in deciding which nutritious foods to eat. The family is stronger when together.
6.2 Gender roles
Male and female members of the family sourced food from all the sites. The food was sourced from the farm or bought from the market and shops. It was, however, the woman’s responsibility to ensure that the family had a meal, whether she got the money from the 
husband to purchase it or sourced it from the farm. Women got most of the food from the 
farm and only bought goods when there was drought and crop failure or when supported by the husband (if not on a paying job). Men bought food when they had money or when requested by their wives to do so. 
6.2.1 Who cooks?
Traditionally, only women were supposed to cook while men herded the family livestock. This has changed as it was reported that some men were involved in cooking, especially when their spouse was unwell or away from home. Girls (more 
often than boys) also cooked to assist their mothers or when they were away. 
6.2.2 Determination of what is to be cooked
The woman often decided what was to be cooked and used her judgement to know 
what was best or available for the family. This usually depended on the availability of a particular food. Sometimes the women made the decision following a request 
from a family member for a change of food/diet. The energy source for cooking 
and the time involved in preparation and cooking also determined the choice of food to be cooked. Children (boys and girls) without parents made their own decisions. Similarly, men made decisions in families where mothers were missing, either through death or otherwise. There was no defined budget for purchasing 
food. Those who had a budget for food did not follow it strictly. This was because 
most of the food was sourced from the farm and was not costed (except when stored food from the farm got finished).
6.2.3 Who was served first
Most participants agreed that the man was usually served first because he was the head of the family and deserved respect. Others attributed this to the cultural norms where men were given first priority in all activities. In some families 6. Discussions
Page 16:
16
GENDER-SENSITIVE NUTRITION TRAININGS IN MAKUENI AND NAKURU: KENYA IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
the youngest child was the first to be served. Men were given a larger portion 
because they were the heads of the family. A few got the same serving as the rest of the family members or shared their portion with younger children (especially 
grandchildren). 
6.2.4 Food for different gender
Some types of food were customarily reserved for men alone. In the Kamba 
community for instance, the tongue and liver were eaten by men and not women. However, this is no longer the case in all the five sites, a practice attributed to 
increased exposure of members in the different communities. 
6.2.5 Seasonality and family diets
Seasonality plays an important role in family diets. Only what was available on the 
farm at different times of the season/ year could be eaten at a particular time. For example, green vegetables were only available to most farmers during the rainy 
season. Some foods could only be bought from the market when out of season. 
A big percentage of fruits in Makueni were sold, and only small quantities were reserved for family consumption. Foods commonly consumed in the communities are shown in Table 1 below.

7.1 Elderly ladies
Generally, the elderly ladies were said to have chosen food that represented a balanced 
diet for their families. They had starch as the main food, green vegetables, fruits, water, and a balanced serving for all genders. Children received a good portion of those foods 
required for their growth and development (Figure 16).
FIGURE 16: Arrangement by an elderly lady in Nakuru shows a balanced diet choice and equal portions for all genders.

7.2 Young ladies
The young ladies chose food that was easy to prepare. In most cases this was not 
nutritionally balanced. The children were apportioned snacks and fruits (Figure 18)

7.3 Selection by men
Food chosen by men varied from simple meals of unbalanced diets to balanced full 
meals (Figure 19). The simple meals were selected based on them requiring little initial preparation. Men did not want to spend a lot of time preparing food and pre-preparing 
vegetable was considered tedious and substituted often with meat.

7.4  Nutritional value of food for pregnant women, children under 
five and the elderly
Requirements for different family members were discussed. Everyone in the family 
needs a balanced and nutritious diet. Meals should consist of the five groups of food (starch, proteins, vitamins, lipids, and mineral nutrients) and plenty of drinking water. The 
importance of iron and zinc at the early development stage of the child (1-2 years) was 
reiterated. The best diets are required during the first eleven years of a child’s growth for proper brain and body development. 
Lactating and pregnant mothers require foods rich in iron, iodine, and amino acids. These 
groups should eat for two (up to five times daily). Pregnant women need iron, calcium, and 
plenty of water. 
The elderly suffer from loss of energy and diseases that result from ageing. Usually, most 
of them have teeth problems and are lonely. This group of people require nutrient-rich 
foods, especially proteins and balanced proportions from other food groups.

The training involved active dialogue between the farmers (trainees) and facilitators thus 
encouraging a free atmosphere and flow of information. The information from farmers in all the five sites indicated that food is mainly sourced from the farms by the women who 
are also the main decision-makers for daily family meals. Men buy food when necessary. 
Empowering both women and men on the most nutritious foods and how to cook them for the family is important. The role playing showed that elderly ladies were more knowledgeable about balanced family nutrition compared to younger women. Therefore, the younger ladies need to be the target of nutrition trainings to improve the health of 
family members. 
The UU and HER+ Kenya team acknowledges funding for the trainings and are grateful 
to the farmers for their participation. Thanks also goes the Makueni and Nakuru County Extension Staff who were instrumental in mobilizing the farmers and also giving technical 
input. We thank Olga Spellman, and Vincent Johnson, Science Editors (Alliance of 
Bioversity International and CIAT Science Writing Service) for English and content editing of this report.

FPOs that center women farmers, traditionally at a disadvantage vis-a-vis their male counterparts in access to resources and extension, can serve to enhance women's agency and collective action in agricultural value chains. We used 59 key informant interviews and nine focus group discussions to examine the constraints to, and facilitators of, women's and men's participation in three women-only FPOs in Jharkhand, an eastern Indian state. The FPO intervention we evaluated provided members with both agricultural and gender-based inputs to improve agronomic practices, market linkages, agricultural yields and profits, and the role of women both within the FPO and within their households and communities. We provided contextual insights on 'what works' to empower women in this context. Women's perceptions of the benefits from FPO membership were heterogeneous. Our qualitative analysis suggests a nuanced picture of women's autonomy and decision-making within and outside their household, further shaped by women's and men's perception of shifts in women's access to resources and services. The emerging lessons provide inputs for development implementers and policymakers to recognize diverse contextual barriers in designing FPO interventions to enable and enhance women empowerment outcomes. The research also contributes to the body of knowledge on local gender norms and understanding of empowerment.

Women's contributions to agriculture and food systems have always been vital, but structural inequalities have kept them from reaching their full potential. Recent efforts to improve women's empowerment in agri-food systems have mostly focused on expanding women's access to resources, markets, and knowledge. Unfortunately, these efforts have not done enough to tackle the root causes of gender inequality in agri-food systems. A 'gender transformative' approach, on the other hand, seeks to shift the underlying social norms, power relations, and institutional arrangements that sustain gender inequality. This article proposes that a gender transformative approach is necessary for Fiji to achieve sustainable and equitable agri-food systems. Using case studies from Fiji and elsewhere, this research highlights the potential benefits of a gender transformative strategy, such as increased productivity, better nutrition, and greater social inclusion. However, it acknowledges the challenges and complications of putting such a policy into effect, particularly in the face of cultural and economic hurdles. In order for Fiji to attain true gender equality and sustainable development in its agri-food systems, a gender transformative strategy is necessary, as argued in this article. It will take cooperation from government officials, nonprofits, and businesses for this to come to fruition. At the article's conclusion, suggestions are made for enacting a gender transformative strategy in agri-food systems, both in Fiji and worldwide.

Women street hawkers and vendors selling greens, flowers, meat and fish in urban and rural areas take a vital place in the agri-food systems. These small day-to-day businesswomen play a major role in bringing in the produce to markets for sale. Understanding their impact on the ecosystem of the respective supply chains will enable future research on the positioning and impact of these vendors and hawkers in the ecosystem. In our work, we sought to understand three aspects of women street vendors and hawkers: (a) The time invested and the gains they receive on a day-to-day basis. What is their present status of technology usage in terms of phones, smart phones, and digital payments? What are the pros and cons of digital transformation in their lives? What aspirations they hold for the future and upgrade of technological help for further improvement to their lives? (b) What alternatives are available and what are the opportunity costs involved if they are moving out of their routine? What is their awareness of saving and support systems they have for a rainy day? (c) What is their awareness of and aspirations for governmental intervention in their lives? The work will collect 20 plus personal interviews of both men and women street vendors and hawkers through a survey from a metropolitan, semi-urban and rural areas of Telanagana and Andhra Pradesh. The present work will facilitate and help understand the agency that is the government for a relevant intervention and support for the betterment of the women street vendors and hawkers.

Item From Research to Impact: Towards just and resilient agri-food systems ( Report , 2023-10-12 ) CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform ; Indian Council of Agricultural Research Show more No Thumbnail Available Item Gender attitudes on politics and leadership: A framing experiment ( Poster , 2023-10-10 ) Ning Ma ; Ragasa, Catherine ; Kyle, Jordan Show more This paper measures the extent of attitudes toward gender inequality in leadership at different levels of decisionmaking. We also estimated the effect of a subtle gender frame on those gender attitudes through a randomized survey experiment. Using a sample of 241 experts involved in federal- and state-level agri-food policy process in Nigeria, we presented six statements that support gender (in)equality in leadership at different levels and asked the experts to rate each statement using a four-point Likert scale. Study results show persistent gender norms around women’s leadership roles, even among elites and experts: 4–20% of female experts and 30–46% of male experts in our sample still believe that men are better in leadership positions at different levels. Female experts’ gender attitudes did not vary by the level of decision-making and by gender frame; however, males’ gender attitudes varied significantly by the level of decision-making and by the gender frame. Those randomly assigned the gender equality frame (e.g., Women make equally good or better political leaders than men do) were less likely to have attitudes in support of gender inequality in leadership than those randomly assigned the gender-inequality frame (e.g., Men make better political leaders than women do). Male respondents tended to disagree less on the statements that support gender equality than to agree on the statements that support gender inequality. Assessing attitudes through surveys is often challenging and biased, as we show that responses to sensitive gender questions are malleable and sensitive to subtle framing. We demonstrate that subtle frames affect survey responses, which warrants attention to a more careful survey design Show more Loading... Item Gender and social inclusion impact of climate change, COVID shocks and stresses on agriculture and food systems in Tanzania: The case of Maasai women in Chalinze district ( Presentation , 2023-10-09 ) Genda, Elizabeth Lulu Show more Consideration to gender matters is important for the equity of climate change adaptation programs and effective food security. The overlaying global socioecological emergencies of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have simultaneously impacted food security. The study assessed the impacts of climate change and COVID-19 outbreak on food security among Maasai using gender lenses. The paper is a result of mixed-methods research design that mainly relied on interviews, focus group discussion, and questionnaire. The findings shows that Maasai women were facing difficulties caused by climate change long before COVID-19 outbreak due to their nomadic nature, where men migrated with livestock to areas with better pasture and water for livestock— leaving behind women and children. This affected women because they depend on milk and its products for family consumption and income; consequently, absence of livestock triggered food insecurity. The study recommended that government and its agencies and stakeholders: increase their consideration to the climate change stresses on agriculture and food systems through gender programs; strengthen the integration of research into climate adaptation programs; increase advocacy for coping with climate change–related risks in relationship to nature and ecosystems and values that drive inequalities in development and resist social reforms.

Item Gender analysis of climate stressed rice-based systems in Mali ( Presentation , 2023-10-12 ) Diabate, Fatoumata ; Mujawamariya, Gaudiose Show more Agriculture and livestock represent the main incomegenerating activity for women and youth in the rural areas of Mali. It is expected that climate change will lead to a reduction in food production due to changes in rainfall patterns and temperature in Africa (Awojobi and Tetteh, 2017), and Mali is facing the same challenges. To cope with such climateinduced stress, women and youth need information and access to climate-smart technologies. This study analyzes the role of women in rice-based systems heavily affected by climate stress, and their access to resources on climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and Climate Information Services (CIS) in Mali. Mixed methods were applied: a quantitative study covered 766 male and female respondents in 383 households and a qualitative investigation engaged 134 women and 155 men in 34 focus group, plus 29 key informants in the major rice-growing regions in Mali. The study showed large gaps between female and male farmers’ access to resources: specific gender constraints in the rice-based activity include access to land, improved seeds, rice farming, machinery, formal credit facilities, extension services, labor force, fertilizers and climate information. Particularly, the willingness to maintain women in the conditions of dependency was observed, hence, they were likely to abandon rice production or remain in labor-wage activities due to multiple climaterelated challenges they were facing Show more Loading... Item Gender and demand stimulation for agricultural mechanization service use in Ethiopia ( Presentation , 2023-10-11 ) Jaleta, Moti ; Mohammed, Abdu ; Gebresilasse, Mesay ; Godlonton, Susan Show more Agricultural mechanization is less developed in subSaharan Africa (SSA). Even in areas where there are scale-appropriate mechanization services, their use by smallholders (especially by women farmers) is minimal due to various social and economic factors. Following a randomized control trial (RCT) approach in stimulating men and women farmers in machinery-service use for cereals threshing and collecting survey data from 841 women-headed and 1,116 men-headed households in East and Southwest Shewa Zones in Central Ethiopia, this paper assesses how gender of the household head affects the demand for mechanization services. Empirical results show that gender of a household head is associated with the use of machinery services. Younger household heads are more proactive in using incentives provided in stimulating machinery-service use for threshing. Regardless of the gender of household heads, there is a location difference on the intensity of mechanizationservice use by smallholders. In most of the cases, the size of the cultivated farmland matters in mechanizationservice use. Overall, subsidies have a significant effect in stimulating demand for mechanization services by smallholders. However, no significant difference was observed between men and women household heads in using the provided incentives for demand stimulation. This implies that availability of mechanization services alone does not guarantee use of these services by men and women farmers. It is essential to further explore the role of institutional setups in which smallholder farmers operate and the supply side challenges service providers have in reaching out to men and women farmers under poor rural infrastructure.

Item Game-Changing Innovations for Food System Transformation: Evidence on Women’s Inclusion in Livestock Vaccines Systems in Northern Ghana ( Presentation , 2023-10-11 ) Njiru, Nelly ; Galiè, Alessandra ; Omondi, Immaculate A. ; Omia, Dalmas ; Loriba, Agnes ; Awin, Peter Show more There has been considerable debate on how to develop gender-equitable agri-food innovations. Much of the debate is on whether gender-accommodative approaches (GAAs) and the more-recent gendertransformative approaches (GTAs) can work and how. Evidence on best pathways for gender-equitable agri-food innovations is limited. Livestock contributes to animalsource foods and to progress toward gender-equitable agri-food systems. Gender inequality reduces women’s access to productive resources, including livestock vaccines, with negative consequences on livestock productivity and women’s empowerment. We present results of a systematic assessment of interventions by a development project—the Women Rear—and their contribution to change in gender norms, access to livestock vaccines, and women’s empowerment (WE). Qualitative data were collected from 25 single-sex and one mixed focus group discussions (FGDs) and 39 key informant interviews (KIIs) with different value chain actors to assess changes in gender norms that limit women’s ability to access livestock vaccines and their empowerment, after the GT and the GA interventions. Resulting from GTAs, the restrictive gender norms started to relax. Prior to the project, women were not allowed to own livestock, state in any context that they owned them and sell them. Now they can do all three things (albeit at different degrees). Men appreciate that these changes reduced men’s financial burden. Women’s empowerment and critical consciousness are positively associated with changes in gender norms. We recommend pathways toward more-inclusive livestock research and innovation that contribute to women’s empowerment and healthy livestock for inclusive agrifood systems. Show more Loading... Item From seeds of change to harvesting equality: Women in India’s agro-ecology based agri-food systems ( Poster , 2023-10-10 ) Singh, Sonali Show more The Indian agricultural system is undergoing rapid degradation because of climate-induced shocks and stressors. As a result, there have been endeavors among governments, civil society organizations and researchers to embrace transformative approaches toward the agri-food system. Within this context, agroecology has emerged as a comprehensive methodology that aims to reshape food systems by harnessing the interconnectedness between indigenous knowledge, local conservation practices, social capital and strategies for adapting to the climate crisis. The pivotal role of women within agro-ecology is widely acknowledged, as their active engagement is considered crucial to the success and effectiveness of this approach. However, significant constraints persist in limiting women’s meaningful participation in agro-ecological farming systems, including constraints imposed by existing agricultural policies, institutional frameworks, gender roles, and limited access to markets, land, and information. Employing a gender and political-economy framework, this paper analyzes how agro-ecological approaches to agri-food systems have the potential to empower women, and where gaps and institutional barriers remain in limiting the participation of women. Through a comprehensive review of agriculture policy documents, case studies and empirical evidence, this study seeks to uncover the gaps and challenges in achieving gender-responsive policy and institutional frameworks within the agro-ecological context. By examining the intersectionality between gender, climate change, and food systems, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of the Indian agri-food systems and offers an alternative, inclusive paradigm to conventional systems of practice.

Item From waste to managed waste facility and compost for farming: The role of women movement in urban villages in Bali, Indonesia ( Poster , 2023-10-10 ) Utomo, Marcellinus Mandira Budi ; Pieter, Levina Augusta Geraldine ; Kusumawati, Dewi ; Putra, Hermitianta P. Show more One of the problems faced by urban areas is waste, including in Pejeng Village, Bali, Indonesia. With the issuance of Governor Regulation No. 47 of 2019, waste management must be carried out at the village level through waste management facilities (TPS3R) and Pejeng is one of the villages that has successfully implemented this regulation. With so many TPS3R failing halfway, the study of the success factors of TPS3R in Pejeng is important, so that its findings can be a recommendation for possible factors so that TPS3R is successful in other villages. Through field observations, in-depth interviews with key informants, and participatory action research (PAR), it was found that the role of the Pejeng Village women’s organization ‘Laskar Pertiwi’, who voluntarily set aside their time in the waste management movement, has a very large role in educating residents to carry out waste sorting at the household level and never giving up despite many rejections in the early stages of the program, go directly to the field to collect waste and process organic waste into compost for soil improvement materials for agriculture. Through PAR purchasing compost from TPS3R Pejeng and providing compost grants to rice farmers in one planting season as a stimulus to switch from non-organic to organic farming, it is known that there are still compost sales challenges because making rice farmers aware of how to consistently farm organic rice still takes time. Nevertheless, Laskar Pertiwi has succeeded in creating a healthier living environment, waste that has a selling value, and increased public awareness. Show more Loading... Item From hotspots to hope: Unearthing gender narratives in climate-touched terrains ( Presentation , 2023-10-11 ) CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform Show more The objective of the session is bringing together key pieces of primary research on gender equality in transforming agri-food systems in the face of climate change, conducted in the framework of a collaboration between IDRC, the GENDER Impact Platform, and CGIAR and external partners. A research program was set up to identify pathways in changing food systems that allow for increasing gender equality. Climate change emerged as a significant and critical trend, simultaneously affecting agri-food systems and gender equality; hence this research focuses on the intersection of climate change, agri-food systems and gender equality. The conceptual framework builds on the gendered food systems frameworks, as well as recent frameworks linking climate change and gender equality in agri-food systems. The session will briefly introduce how we identified climate–agriculture–gender inequality hotspots. The session will include two presentations of results of in-depth case studies examining the intersections of climate change, gender equality and agri-food systems in such hotspots, more particularly in Bangladesh and Zambia. This will be followed by two presentations of results of quasi-experimental impact studies testing the potential of interventions to address gender equality in food systems and in climate resilience in these hotspots. A representative of IDRC will attend, reflecting on the overarching learning and implications for gender equality and climate action in interventions. Show more Loading... Item Framework for gender in feeds and forages research ( Poster , 2023-10-10 ) Njuguna-Mungai, Esther ; Galiè, Alessandra ; Duncan, Alan J. ; Lukuyu, Ben A. ; Derseh, Melkamu ; Jones, Christopher S. ; Amole, Tunde A. ; Baltenweck, Isabelle Show more Low livestock productivity often observed in developing countries is partly attributed to unimproved genetic stocks and inadequate animal health services, but the scarcity of high-quality and sufficient feeds is the critical constraining factor. The livestock feed challenge persists despite many investment programs focused on livestock feed research and development over the past three decades. Feed availability on small-scale farms is also impacted by climate change factors that lead to seasonal droughts during which feed resources are scarce, pastures dry up, distance to scavenge for feeds increases and market-based alternatives become expensive. The limited availability of feed during the dry season results in sizeable seasonal fluctuation in milk (or other products) production and, in extreme cases, producers lose their livestock. Community social norms (informal rules and regulations) lead to women, youth and men experiencing the feeds challenge in different ways in different locations. This gender and feeds conceptual framework is designed to help unpack the gender considerations to focus on in the feeds value chains in diverse livestock production systems in lowand medium-income countries (LMIC). It focuses on how, where, and which gender considerations matter in feed-resource targeting, feed-option improvement, and feed input/output marketing and delivery. The aim is to positively affect the knowledge about and adoption of improved feed technologies and innovations, among men and women farmers, to ultimately contribute to enhanced livestock production in the smallholder systems in LMIC as a component of agri-food systems.

Item Framework for climate resilience in food systems with a gendered lens ( Presentation , 2023-10-12 ) Tank, Nikita ; Vishwanath, Drishti ; Choudhary, Anjali Show more With the acknowledgment of climate change as a key development concern, the concept of climate resilience to combat its impacts has gained research and policy impetus. Further, there has been a growing emphasis on gender in climate resilience, given that women are documented as experiencing greater vulnerabilities and adaptation challenges. In the domain of agriculture and food systems, various studies develop a conceptual framework, as well as identify resilience indicators within these; for example, Waldick identifies key drivers of climate resilience (governance, demographics, markets, etc.) within a framework, and Lipper identifies potential pathways of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). Huyer expands Lipper’s framework to integrate gender and social inclusive dimensions. Given the multiplicity of interpretations and frameworks, this study seeks to: (a) examine the existing frameworks on climate resilience and gender in food systems through a systematic review, and (b) build on and strengthen these to develop an encompassing framework considering various contexts and intersectionalities, drawing from field learnings in Odisha, India. This is a mixed-methods study including secondary data and information synthesis, focus group discussions and qualitative interviews of stakeholders in food systems. The framework can serve as a comprehensive conceptual and practical diagnostic tool for policymakers to apply across different agriculture and food subsystems (such as crops, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture), for local and state contexts.

Item Four key enablers of youth empowerment to achieve more sustainable agri-food systems ( Presentation , 2023-10-10 ) Panday, Dinesh Show more Our agri-food systems are facing increasing shocks and stresses, which puts them under immense pressure. This raises the question of whether we can produce efficiently to meet rising global demand, while protecting the environment and communities inclusively and more sustainably. For this question, it is necessary to adopt practices that can make agriculture and forestry more efficient under limited availability of natural resources. However, the key challenge is to transform current agri-food systems into more resilient, sustainable, equitable and accessible systems for all and it is essential to identify and support the main drivers of this transformation. The first cohort of Young Scientists Group (2022–2023) conducted a review, including case studies and an interview, on specific policy issues, of particular concern to youth, related to agri-food systems transformation. We explored that youth, including diverse groups such as rural youth, indigenous youth, young women, etc., are better positioned as drivers and agents of change by advancing four key enablers (education, technology, science and policy) especially given their willingness to take risks and adopt new ideas. The complete report is divided into five chapters: (i) provides an overview of the latest issues affecting agri-food systems, (ii) focuses on the challenges faced by youth who are working to advance sustainable agri-food systems, (iii) identifies and explores four key enablers of youth empowerment, (iv) highlights existing youth-based initiatives for improving agri-food systems, and (v) provides conclusions with 18 science-based and action-oriented recommendations that need to be adopted immediately to achieve more sustainable agrifood systems.

Item Adopting a gender-transformative approach (GTA) to increase dietary diversity and decision-making of women: Evidence from a nutrition-sensitive intervention in Bangladesh ( Poster , 2023-10-10 ) Nahar, Kamrun ; Mahfuzul Haque, A.B.M. ; Hossain, Mohammad Mokarrom Show more Given the high levels of malnutrition in Bangladesh, and the importance of fish in providing micronutrients, we sought to understand the dietary diversity, level of nutrition knowledge, awareness and attitude toward fish consumption among fisheries communities in the Cox’s Bazar area. In addition, the study aims to assess the effects of gender-transformative approaches (recognizing the importance of targeting both husbands (men) and wives (women). The study also targets other influential members within the households to improve the food, nutrition and build skills in communication and problem-solving to discuss nutrition and genderrelated problems that were implemented in the technical training portfolio for agriculture, aquaculture, nutrition, and market development interventions. The study aims to assess the effects of gendertransformative approaches to discussing nutrition- and gender-related problems that were implemented in the technical training portfolio for agriculture, aquaculture, nutrition and market development interventions targeting female beneficiaries and their husbands to challenge gendered barriers to agriculture, health and nutrition behaviors. Data were collected using mixed methods; we carried out quantitative survey from 322 artisanal fisher households (project beneficiaries) of Cox’s Bazar district. We collected qualitative (semistructured interviews), 16 focus group discussions and 16 key informant interviews. The result shows that the proportion of women who are consuming an inadequate diet was 55% of households that have a lower dietary diversity score, while 45% have an acceptable dietary diversity score after the intervention. Whereas 82% of the households had lower dietary diversity scores, and only 18% of households had acceptable dietary diversity scores at the baseline with increased participation in the critical household decision-making process. The basic nutrition- awareness training participants (92%) understood topics. Nutrition (92%) and caring for pregnant mothers (84%) and women’s knowledge contributed to women’s dietary diversity. The majority of participants (92%) understood the topics of the gender sensitization training: workload sharing (94%), joint decision-making (66%), and trust building (64%). Most participants practised workload sharing (91%), joint decision-making (70%) and trust building (61%).

 Introduction  
Midway to the endpoint of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , ambitions of achieving 
gender equality and empowering all women and girls (SDG  5) remain a distant reality. UN Women ’s 
Gender Snapshot 2022 shows that using the current path to progress, it would take nearly 300 
years to achieve gender equality. The poly -crises of COVID -19, climate, conflict, and food crises have 
not only halted , but in many contexts reversed progress toward  gender equality.                                  
In agri -food systems, unequal gender and social relations undermine the mitigation of and 
responses to these and future crises , and hinder the  resilience of  rural  people and landscapes.  
  
In the tradition of the annual CGIAR GENDER  conferences , the international conference “From 
research to impact: Towards just and resilient agri -food systems ” addressed the se gender and social 
inequalities that lie at the heart of food systems.  
The conference was held in  person in New Delhi, India, October 9–12, 2023  at the Bharat Ratna C. 
Subramaniam Auditorium, NASC Complex, Dev Prakash Shastri Marg, Pusa, New Delhi, 110012 , and 
was co-organized by the  CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform  and the  Indian Council of Agricultural 
Research  (ICAR).  
 
Aims 
The conference aims were threefold : 
1) To promote sharing cutting -edge knowledge  on gender and inclusion in food systems to 
help bridge the gap between research and practice ; and foster gender -equal and socially 
inclusive, resilient food systems.  
2) To strengthen social networks and partnerships for impact , by catalyz ing scientific 
exchanges and dialogues among researchers from diverse types of organizations and 
creat ing opportunities to engage with knowledge users (policymakers, practitioners, 
private -sector actors,  and others) working toward the shared goal of food systems 
transformation.  
3) To strengthen capacities  of researchers, practitioners and a wide variety of actors to 
address gender and social inclusion considerations meaningfully and with impact in their 
work.  
Themes  
The conference focused on the links between research, evidence, impacts on gender equality and 
social inclusion, and their relationship with other food system outcomes  (diets, nutrition and 
health; poverty and livelihoods; environmental health; climate resilience).

 The conference sought to include presentations that examined : 
1) What kinds of evidence, innovations, and combinations thereof, developed and used under 
which conditions, can be levers of transformative change ? 
2) How research for development processes , and all that they entail —equitable partnerships, 
etc.— can catalyze  gender -transformative change in food systems ? 
Under this broad umbrella, we welcomed contributions on the following themes:  
1. A gender and social inclusion lens on resilience in the context of climate change, COVID -19 
and other shocks and stresses  
Although rural women in all their diversity often possess specialized knowledge and skills that 
contribute to climate -resilient agriculture, their typical exclusion from decision -making processes 
limits their ability to shape policies and programs that affect their lives. Additionally, the impacts of 
conflict and COVID -19 are unevenly distributed due to existing gender inequalities in access to 
resources, formal education, information, finance, health care, economic opportunities, care 
responsibilities  and more.  
This theme addresse d the gendered dimensions of these challenges and their root causes . It 
explore d approaches that elevate women ’s voices ; address unequal work burdens and power 
dynamics ; and increase equitable access to information, markets  and lucrative economic 
opportunities. We invite d contributions on effective strategies for mitigating and adapting to 
multiple shocks and stresses ; and promoting sustainable development for women, their families  
and their communities —particularly from an intersectional perspective.  
Suggested su bthemes included : 
• Understanding the gender and social inclusion impacts of climate change, COVID -19, 
conflict , and other shocks and stresses on agri-food systems . 
• Examining the role of gender and other social relations in shaping adaptive and 
transformative capacities for building resilience.  
• Exploring the links between individual agency , and household and community resilience to 
climate shocks and stresses.  
• Understanding the gendered implications of safety nets and humanitarian response to 
climate and conflict shocks , and their impacts on the agri -food systems.  
• Assessing the gender inclusiveness of policies addressing climate and other shocks and 
stresses within the agri -food system.  
• Developing gender -responsive solutions to food crises in the context of climate change and 
other shocks and stresses.  
• Analyzing gendered considerations for, and impacts of, climate finance for agri-food 
systems . 
• Conflict -sensitive, gender -inclusive  and socially  inclusive approaches to agri-food systems .

 2. From women ’s empowerment to gender -transformative change in agri-food  systems  
In this theme, we invite d contributions that help conceptualize  and assess women ’s empowerment, 
social gender norms, masculinities and femininities, and gender -transformative change and the 
linkages among these. We explore d approaches and innovations that can transform the social and 
gender norms that restrict the achievement of equitable, sustainable food systems. We s ought 
practical lessons and implications from success stories , and from interventions or larger change 
processes that have had unintended disempowering effects on women and gender equality in agri -
food systems.  
Suggested subthemes included:  
• Conceptualizing and unpacking women ’s empowerment, masculinities, social (gender) 
norms, and gender -transformative change in agri-food  systems.  
• Assessing and/or measuring women ’s empowerment or gender -transformative change.  
• Exploring how women ’s empowerment, masculinities, norms  and gender -transformative 
change are linked conceptually and in program s. 
• Evidence about approaches that have created pathways for attaining and sustaining 
women ’s empowerment and gender -transformative change in food systems, and of their 
effects.  
• Analysis of principles, approaches, challenges and opportunities for engaging men and 
masculinities toward  gender -transformative change in agri-food  systems.  
• Emerging challenges, gaps  and rolling back of gender equality gains in agri-food  systems.  
• Examining and addressing gender -based violence in agri-food  systems.  
 
3. Gender -responsive and -transformative agri-food  systems innovations  
Access to information, quality inputs, capital, markets, land  and more are not equitably distributed 
across gender groups. The problem is complex and is partly because of a lack of understanding of 
agri-food systems and technologies that enable inclusive and equitable productivity and income 
gains. Technology and innovation are seldom, if ever, gender neutral. To advance toward  gender 
equality and inclusive development, women and men from various socioeconomic and 
demographic backgrounds must have equal opportunity to innovate, and to adapt, adopt  and 
benefit from agri -food systems innovations. In this theme, we invite d contributions that 
conceptualize, assess  and/or  evaluate the gender -responsiveness or gender -transformative 
potential of agri -food system innovations that address the production, distribution  and/or  
consumption of food.  
Suggested subthemes included:  
• Identifying metrics/measures to assess the inclusivity and gender -responsiveness or gender -
transformative potential of agri -food systems innovations and their associated gendered 
outcomes.  
Page 9:
  8 
 • Exploring the underlying behavioral and socio economic  factors shaping the adoption /non -
adoption  of these innovations.  
• Assessing outcomes of gender -responsive production technologies and innovations, 
including crop/livestock/fish improvement, mechanization, sustainable intensification  and 
digital innovation.  
• Identifying the gendered benefits and pitfalls of approaches and interventions aiming to 
promote inclusive biodiversity ; natural resource, water  and landscape management ; 
fisheries and aquaculture ; forestry and agroforestry ; and livestock development and 
pastures.  
• Examining the role of social innovations, including collective action and institutional change, 
in advancing gender equality and social inclusion in agri -food systems.  
• Examining socio technical bundles, and their impacts and promise for equitable agri -food 
systems.  
 
4. Fostering equitable market systems  
This theme s ought to shed light on how to create an enabling agri -food market environment for 
women, youth, poor men, and other marginalized individuals and communities. It examine d how 
these social groups can not only fully participate in, but also benefit equitably from, agri -food 
market innovations and systems.  
Suggested subthemes included:  
• Gendered access to assets and resources (financial, knowledge, networks, labor, among 
others) that enable participation in and benefits from agri -food market systems.  
• The quality and inclusiveness of engagement (participation, benefits, etc.) across agri -food 
value chains ( at high, medium and low levels ). 
• Gender (in)equity in formal and informal agri -food sectors, and interconnections across 
sectors.  
• Gender equality and social inclusion in cross -border trade of agri -food commodities.  
• Policies and regulations (e.g., licenses, certification, taxation) supporting or hindering 
gender equality in agri -food market systems.  
• Engagement and commitment of private, government and development sectors toward  
gender equality and social inclusion in market systems.  
• Gender -responsive and -transformative approaches for addressing social norms and barriers 
that impede gender equality in agri -food market systems.  
• The potential of corporate social responsibility, voluntary sustainability standards (e.g., 
third -party certification systems) and other alternative market schemes for promoting 
gender equality.

 5. Delivering nutrition, food security  and health for all  
Women play a significant role within the food system —as farmers, processors, traders  and 
consumers.  However, entrenched gender inequities —reflected in income and asset disparities 
between women and men, norms that prioritize the nutrition of men and boys over women and 
girls, women ’s limited decision -making power in the household, and more —contribute to 
persistently lower health and nutrition outcomes for women and girls in many settings. Addressing 
gender equality and women ’s empowerment within food systems is critical for improving women ’s 
health and well -being, and for progressing toward  food and nutrition security for all. This theme 
sought contributions that address gender issues across the links between food security, nutrition 
and health, with a specific focus on agri -food systems.  
Suggested subthemes included:  
• Links between gender (in)equality and/or women ’s empowerment and nutrition, health and 
food security.  
• Gender inequality in paid and/or unpaid (care, etc.) work within agri-food  system s—
stemming from formal and informal institutions and structures —that shape gendered 
nutrition and health outcomes.  
• Gender gaps in access to and control over productive resources that lead to gender 
disparities in food security, nutrition and health outcomes.  
• Gender analyses of resilience to shocks and of social protection relate d to food security, 
nutrition and health outcomes.  
• Emerging issues  and new conceptual framings related to gender and food security, nutrition 
and health in agri-food  systems such as  
o Gender -responsive nutrition interventions in agri-food  systems.  
o The intersection of gender and health.  
 
6. Youth and agri-food  systems  
Young people are increasingly considered a distinct group in interventions seeking socially inclusive 
food systems outcomes. They are often constructed in  relation to adults or stereotyped. In this 
theme, we invite d contributions that shed light on young people as food systems actors in their 
own right,  and reflect on how food system interventions and transformations can provide 
productive and rewarding livelihoods for young people. Contributions that consider the 
intersectionalities that shape young people ’s identities, social positions and their opportunities, 
barriers and choices were particularly encouraged . 
Suggested subthemes included:  
Young people ’s engagement with agri-food  systems across supply chains (food production, 
processing, trading and beyond).  
• Rural transitions ; migration ; and diverse, multi local and multi sectoral livelihoods.  
Page 11:
  10 
 • Youth aspirations and how they shape interactions with food systems livelihoods.  
• Youthful gender dynamics in agriculture, agri-food  trade and/or processing.  
• Youth perspectives on intergenerational dynamics in agri-food  systems.  
• Intersectionality in youth studies in agri -food systems.

 Organization  
Committees  
The Conference Chair ( Dr. Marlène Elias) and the Conference Secretariat worked from at the 
Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT  (the Alliance) , given that the Center leads the CGIAR 
GENDER Impact Platform ’s Alliances Module, where the conference was housed . The Conference 
Organizing Secretaries (Dr. Ranjitha Puskur and Dr. Seema Jaggi) were from the International Rice 
Research Institute (IRRI) and ICAR , respectively . Thirteen (13) committees —comprised of members 
from CGIAR and ICAR —oversaw the organization and delivery of the conference ( Annex 1). 
Three CGIAR centers (the Alliance, IRRI and ILRI) worked closely together  on various aspects of 
event  planning and delivery  in India . The Delhi -based events management company Alpcord  
Network provided invaluable support to the organization of the conference, from creation of the 
website  to the acquisition of necessary ministry clearances,  registration, travel, accommodation, 
on-site logistics, social events  and protocol aspects linked to the inauguration of the conference by 
chief guest Smt. Droupadi Murmu,  the Honorable President of India.  
Travel, tours and transport logistics  
Seven hotels (Table 1) were selected based on proximity to the conference location and their range 
of prices. Participants were able to book these hotels through the conference website, and 
bookings were managed by Alpcord Network. Participants could book airport pickups and dropoffs 
in a similar way through the website portal. Complimentary shuttles were provided between the 
conference -affiliated hotels and the conference venue each morning and evening of the event.

 The program  
Call for contributions  
Through an open call for contributions, th e organizers invited proposals for contributions from 
researchers, practitioners, graduate students , and other people in every stage of their career, from 
across the globe. The call was shared with partners in national agricultural research and extension 
syste ms (NARES) , partner organizations such as NGOs and civil society organizations (CSOs), and 
others committed to advancing gender  equality  in agri-food  systems research , policy  and practice . 
The call was widely  distributed through the CGIAR GENDER newsletter and other listservs, and 
shared with colleagues from  universities with gender -in-agriculture courses and programs , with a 
submission deadline of June 23, 2023 . It drew much  interest from among gender researchers  and 
practitioners from diverse backgrounds and disciplines . 
To give the most people space to present, a maximum of two abstracts could be submitted for oral 
presentation s by any lead  presenter . When  both abstracts were positively assessed by the Scientific 
Committee, only one was selected for oral presentation  and the other invited as a poster, to allow a 
greater diversity of people to deliver oral present ations . 
The (12) theme leads (two people  per theme) assessed the contributions received for their theme 
based on common criteria  established by the Scientific Committee . 
In total, w e received : 
• 324 presentation abstracts  
o 305 were submitted for consideration as oral presentations, of which 145 were 
accepted  and 124 ultimately presented  as oral  presentation s 
o 19 were submitted for poster s, and 93 were invited as posters  since some of the 
abstracts for oral submissions were invited as posters instead . A total of 86 posters 
were ultimately presented  
• 35 full session proposals , of which nine  were accepted as capacity -strengthening  sessions , 
10 as panel sessions , and four  as scientific sessions  (four separate oral presentations with 
subsequent summary reflection) . 
Notification of abstract acceptance took place  on July 7, 2023.  
 
Session types  
a. Capacity -strengthening sessions   
Capacity -strengthening sessions  provided a deep  dive into a methodology, themes or concepts in 
gender research, or another topic such as integrating gender in training. These sessions were 
interacti ve and took  various formats.  
 
Page 15:
  14 
 b. Scientific sessions  
Scientific sessions were composed of  four oral presentations  each , moderated by a chair . Active 
participation and discussions were fostered  by setting aside time for questions and answers after 
the oral presentations . These sessions also featured a discussant, who was invited to provide a five-
minute reflection at the end of the session.  
 
c. Panel sessions  
Panel sessions convene d distinguished speakers around a critical theme  or issue related to gender 
and inclusion in agri -food systems. Speakers could be from research or other sectors  (e.g., civil 
society, practice, policy, private sector, or donors ) who could share insights from different 
perspectives and speak to the demand for and application of gender research.  
 
d. Open -stream sessions  
The call  also invited p roposals in innovative  formats, such as:  
• documentaries or audio -visual material (photos and videos) integrated into sessions and 
discussed , or made available for viewing asynchronously  
• debates , research pitches, etc.  
• roundtables  
• book or report launches , etc.  
None of the sessions ultimately included in the program  fit that description . 
e. Poster sessions  
Posters were thematically grouped and presented on day 2 (October  10) in six parallel sessions. 
Poster presenters displayed  their physical poster in a gallery at the conference venue, and  were also 
asked to submit one slide on their poster electronically to the conference organizers in advance of 
the conference. These slides were compiled into slide decks t hat were  managed by the session chair 
in each of the six parallel poster session s. 
Each 90 -minute session was composed of approximately 15 individual posters, and each presenter 
had three  minutes to present. The timing of the session was divided as follows: f ive presenters gave 
their three -minute pitch , followed by a 12 -minute  question -and-answer period  for those five 
people . This was repeated three times during the session.  
Each session culminated in the audience voting for a ‘best poster ’ award . The six poster awards 
(one per poster session theme/parallel session) were presented at the conference closing 
ceremony.

 Agenda  and materials  
The accepted sessions, oral presentations  and posters were organized into 60 parallel sessions  over 
10 time slots , with six parallel sessions running at a time.  Each parallel session ran for 90 minutes. In 
addition, the conference program  featured an inaugural session  and four plenary sessions with 
distinguished keynote speakers and panelists, during which no other session s ran in parallel.  
A poster gallery was created to showcase the posters, which were  available for viewing at any time  
in the conference venue . Poster  presentations were thematically organized , and deliver ed during 
six parallel sessions  on day 2.  
The book of abstracts and conference program  provides an overview of the conference ’s organized 
sessions, oral presentations  and posters. All session slides , the conference brochure , presentations 
and posters , and photos  are available online . 
 
Inaugural session  featuring the Hon ’ble President of India  
The Honorable President of India Smt . Droupadi Murmu inaugurated the conference —a historic 
first for a CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform event. Also gracing the inaugural program were: Union 
Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, Union Ministers of State 
for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Kailash Choudhary and Sushri Shobha Karandlaje,

The Colombian Roundtable for Sustainable Cattle (MGS -Col in Spanish), under the guidance 
of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB), organized a groundbreaking global 
event: ""The Symposium on Sustainable Livestock"". This symposium was a major milestone in 
promoting sustainable practices within the cattle industry on a global scale and highlighting  
the crucial connection between carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation.  
The GRSB chose Colombia to organize this Symposium and their annual meeting after a long -
standing dialogue with the MGS -Col, also finding the Colombian bovine and buffalo livestock 
activities one of the most relevant activities in the Caribbean region of C olombia, with an 
inventory of close to 30 million heads, ranking 11th in the global inventory. Therefore, from

stages:  
 
National roundtables representatives after the end of the meeting. Photo: G Serrano (MGS -Col) 
On the first day (March 27), the more than 130 participants from 13 countries (Argentina, 
Colombia, USA, Paraguay, Brazil, New Zealand, Uruguay, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Canada, 
Ecuador, and Costa Rica) gathered to deliberate and scrutinize the action plan aimed at 
solidifying the efforts of this collaborative instit utional network. This involved advancing 
towards the achievement of objectives outlined by GRSB, working in tandem with the 
National Roundtables for Sustainable Livestock across those countries. T he overarching aim 
is to revolutionize beef farming and its entire value chain, steering it towards sustainability.  
In that context, although the MGS -Col comprises more than 70 member organizations, it is 
not formalized to date. Despite lack of formalization, Colombia is a benchmark for sustainable 
cattle farming in Latin America. Claudia Roldán Calle, president of the Colombian Association 
of Buffalo Breeders (Asobúfalos in Spanish), who participated in the discussions, mentioned 
progress towards formalizing it soon: ""Within the Colombian Roundtable for Sustainable 
Cattle, entities such as Asobúfalos, Asosimmental, and Asocriollo are represented. Other 
stakeholders in the supply chain, such as Grupo Éxito, Friogan, NGOs, among others, are also 
part of it. This body was created as a private entity where the Ministries of Environment and 
Agriculture will contribute their p olicies in favor of the sector""  she said. There was a consensus 
from the members of the MGS -Col that the next step is to formalize the MGS -Col to increase 
its incidence in policy making.

Discussion under panel on carbon in livestock landscapes . Photo: JL Urrea (CIAT)  
On the second day (March 28), an open symposium was conducted to explore the correlation 
between carbon sequestration and biodiversity, while also discussing the commitments 
established during the Rio de Janeiro summit and their subsequent endorsement. The  agenda 
included topics like the management of Sustainable Cattle Landscapes within the framework 
of Public Policy, different approaches to sustainable cattle farming of each of the National 
Roundtables; expert panels on carbon and biodiversity in livestoc k landscapes (context and 
dynamics, tools for carbon analysis and measuring at landscape level, funding opportunities, 
among other topics), strategies to integrate carbon sequestration and biodiversity in cattle 
landscapes, and deliberating on roadmaps for  each the National Roundtables to effectively 
integrate carbon sequestration and biodiversity as a critical part of sustainable cattle farming.  
From March 29 to 31, a field trip took place along the Colombian Caribbean coast to gain 
insights into the typical cattle landscapes of the tropical dry forest ecosystem. This excursion 
shed light on the progress made, obstacles faced, and challenges encou ntered by cattle 
production systems in their journey towards sustainability, benefiting farmers and rural 
communities. The focus was on a territorial approach to understand the transformation 
process comprehensively and showcase the main topic of the sympo sium: the link between 
carbon and biodiversity in rural landscapes and the synergy with cattle and buffalo farming in 
the tropical dry forest ecosystem of the Caribbean region.

REPORT  
Page 5 of 10  The overland journey from the city of Cartagena to Monteria, declared as the cattle capital of 
Colombia, covered an extensive territory known for its agricultural and cattle traditions due 
to its vast and fertile floodplains. Its geographical location has solidified it as a corridor of the 
tropical dry forest along the Caribbean coast and the mega wetland that shapes the depresión  
Momposina (an Alluvial plain of 24,650 km² in the north of Colombia, spanning the 
departments of Bolívar, Sucre, and Córdoba).  
The transformation of its natural ecosystems in the floodable savannas is notable due to 
various human pressures such as deforestation, wildlife trafficking, hunting, continual 
changes in land use, and land degradation. Incorporating biodiversity into the planning and 
development of livestock in this territory presents an opportunity for restoring wildlife 
corridors and reviving the ecosystem services provided by the tropical dry forests. This 
integration aims to enhance the productive, social, and environm ental indicators of the 
livestock and agricultural systems present in the region.

Places visited include ‘Hacienda Las Carolinas’ in Corozal (Sucre) which in 2020 started a 
holistic approach on nature -based solutions and since then they operate with a minimum use 
of agricultural machinery and agrochemicals, managing the natural cycles a nd restoring 
natural landscapes. The second farm to visit was ‘Altamira 1’ in Ciénaga de Oro (Córdoba), 
which has a dual -purpose system (beef and milk) with cattle and buffaloes, that have 
implemented silvo -pastoral systems and natural regeneration of nati ve species, along with 
wetlands allows to regulate water during the transition from dry to wet seasons. The third

system. The fourth farm visited, ‘Hacienda Fortaleza’, is focused on breeding of murrah 
buffaloes, to get high -quality milk that complies with USDA regulations  to export to the 
American market, along with certification in Good Cattle  Practices, and National 
Environmental Seal for cattle .

ABC's support to the MGS -Col in 2023 has  above all focused on analyzing the National Level 
Policy  for Sustainable Cattle 2022 -2050, which was released as a  resolution in 2022 and 
developed by MGS -Col between 2017 and 2022. Our analyses comprised two main topics:  
1. How do sustainability policies emerge in the Colombian political system? A Kaleidoscope 
Model Analysis of the Policy for Sustainable Cattle 2022 -2050:  Environmental concerns 
such as deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions have reached 
preoccupying levels globally, for which the governments of different countries have 
committed to mitigation actions. In Colombia, one of the most ambitious initiatives to 
contribute to the commitments is the Policy for Sustainable Cattle 2022 -2050 (Política 
para la Ganadería Bovina Sostenible 2022 -2050 ), whose purpose is to promote the 
transition from traditional cattle farming to sustainable production systems and value 
chains. This study analyzes the construction process of the policy and determin es the 
factors that allowed the change in public policies towards more sustainability. For this, a 
documentary analysis is carried out with a qualitative -descriptive approach consulting 
primary and secondary sources. As a theoretical framework, the Kaleido scope Model of 
Policy Change is used, emphasizing the first three stages, namely a) Agenda Setting, b) 
Design, and c) Adoption, and delving into the fourth stage of Implementation. The results 
reveal that multiple factors allowed the development of the pol icy, such as the need to 
face the environmental crisis, international summits that highlighted the problem, 
previous policies and, in general, an accumulation of experiences and knowledge. It 
became also evident that the main challenges for this policy hav e been the lack of 
coordination among the different national governments, as had its own vision of 
sustainability, in addition to the complexity of coordinating sustainability and 
competitiveness criteria among the ministries. It is concluded that although  the 
development of the policy is a first step in the transition to sustainability, there are still 
many challenges ahead for change to be expressed in concrete actions.

2. Sustainable Cattle Farming in Colombia: Diagnosis and Challenges in the Implementation 
of the Policy Guidelines for Sustainable Cattle 2022 -2050: Our study analyzes the current 
state of the policy (LPGBS) to identify existing difficulties and determine strategies to 
promote sustainability in cattle systems through capacity building among various 
stakeholders. The methodology used is based on a mixed methods approach. First, a 
literature review was conducted on studies related to the evaluation of public policies, 
knowledge transfer, and education in the national cattle sector. This information was 
complemented by 26 key informant interviews with experts representing public and 
private institutions in Colombia who participated in the design of the LPGBS. These 
interviews provided updated information, a s well as key perspectives and practical 
experiences to understand current challenges and identify the capacities needed to 
transition towards sustainable cattle farming in Colombia.

Slide 6:
Who decides what variety to plant and why?
Participation in intra-household decisions about what variety to plant depends on different factors:
Land tenure and local production systems: always relevant in influencing planting decisions, but no global characterization possible. Most common factors were:
Being a landowner and/or holding land use rights
Participating in farming (as a ‘helper’)
Joint decision-making becoming common in some countries [Ethiopia, Kenya] 
Being considered knowledgeable about a crop (farming and/or processing) _x000B_[Uganda – sweet potato, Ethiopia – teff & wheat, Kenya]

Slide 7:
[…] I prefer the old teff varieties [i.e., white teff]. I will explain this to my wife. She has seen the differences, and she may follow me or, if there will be better idea, I will follow her. All the decisions will be made with discussion. Even I cannot take any amount for market if she does not allow me. Before this time, the women were not participating in decision making. For example, my father will not tell her [i.e., his wife] if he wants to sell an ox. He will simply tell one [of] the family members to take that ox to market. 
(SSI, Man, Amhara region, Ethiopia)
It [i.e., planting decision] happens after I have made some investigation about new varieties from my neighbors. If it is not through my neighbors, I mostly get the information on new varieties to plant from the writings on seed packets […]. I make decisions alone because my husband is afraid of the farm [laughs]. I decide which varieties to buy and grow since I’m the one working on the farm.

The same trait could be ascribed to different categories _x000B_depending on its intended function. 
Trait preferences by gender:
Similar preferences between women and men (see also Tegbaru et al. 2020)._x000B_
Women provide more specific preferences for processing traits and men for marketing traits. (see also McDougall et al. 2022)

Slide 11:
Behavioral factors
When they see what I planted and [that] it had yielded well, that is enough to attract them to adopt, because they then believe that it is a good variety.
(FGD, Woman, Eastern region, Uganda – SP)
 After cooking daal with Desi [i.e., indigenous] variety, we can get a thick layer of gravy whereas, in hybrid daal, it becomes waterier. 
(SSI, Woman, Odisha State, India)
When they [i.e., agrodealers]  sell all their seeds, they go buy empty packets and add either the counterfeit seeds or seeds bought from the market, or they mix the seeds. They have machines that seal the packets such that they look genuine. 
(FGD, Man, Western region, Kenya)
Once we are at the farm center, we assume everything there is a good product. So, we don’t pay attention to any writings on containers. We trust they will give us good products and not bad ones because they were put there to assist farmers [to] do what is right.

I have seen the strategy of meeting people on the ground, especially the champions or the lead farmers. You give them a variety to distribute, they will reach the ladies and the men, unlike when we out them in the shops and we ask them to go and pick it. […] So […] for us to be equal and for them to get the information equally, let it be near them just at the ground level […].
(KII, Man [Agronomist], Western region, Kenya)

They [i.e. farmers] look out for the information or explanation from the person that brought the seed. May be there’s an example the person wants to provide regarding someone that uses the seed or the seed has been planted in a particular place and it provided the expected outcome. […] You know there are people that don’t believe or agree with something unless they see it, hear it or touch it.

‘Varietal uptake’: what is planted on a farmer’s field.
‘Trait’: any attribute that farmers deem relevant when choosing what seed to plant.
‘Variety’: Any variety, unless specified.
‘Contextual factors’: Factors characterizing farmers’ living environment at a wider scale and that can influence uptake choices, such as environment, markets, social norms, policies, etc.
‘Behavioral factors’: Factors affecting choice behavior about varieties to plant, e.g., fear that a new seed product may not yield, consumption habits, etc.

Participation in intra-household decisions about what variety to adopt could depend on a multitude of factors:
Land tenure and local production systems: always relevant but no global characterization possible. Major country-specific determinants could be:
Holding land ownership and/or land use rights
Participation in farming (as ‘helper’)
Joint decision-making becoming common in some (mostly East-African) countries
‚Gendering‘ of a crop (at production and/or consumption stage) as determining a person‘s supposed knowledge about the crop‘s performance (Uganda – sweet potato, Ethiopia – teff and wheat)
Groundnut seeding, Mayurbhanj district [India team]
“Women usually decide which teff variety should be used for injera or which wheat variety will be used to prepare what type of dish. We share experience with the varieties with friends, while we gather for coffee. If we see good injera, we ask which variety it is. Then we appreciate, discuss, and try to produce and consume”._x000B__x000B_(SSI, Woman, Debre-Genet, Ethiopia, April 2023)
Slide 6:
Factors influencing uptake decisions
Relevant for both genders
Learning by observing (and experimenting, if possible) was the most preferred way for farmers to build confidence in taking decisions. - Previous experience with IVs was critical in informing future decisions
Local varieties preferred for consumption (risk that a IV could alter the local recipe and compromise the taste/consistency) [India – Green gram, Ethiopia – Teff and wheat, Uganda – Maize]
Dependent on gender or other socioeconomic differences
Affordability of seed prices (women, particularly elderly or widow women being more challenged by affordability problems and trying to source seeds through informal channels/seed exchange)
Access to/affordability of ‘critical’ assets allowing to experiment with IVs (good soil, fertilizers, smartphones, transportations) 
Distance from the location where seeds are made available (women usually facing more mobility restriction due to time constraints and/or access to transportations or requiring permission) 
Literacy required to understand what was written on seed packages, on posters, or in SMS/social media posts
Improved/promoted maize variety [Uganda/Maize team]
“If my neighbor brings a new improved teff variety to try, I will follow up on the results and try to adopt. We do the same for all the varieties we grow here. We also do the same for wheat. I will exchange it with neighbors or try to buy Kekeba and Danfie”. 
(SSI, Woman, Tara Gedam, Ethiopia, April 2023) 
Slide 7:
Information and seed promotion channels
A champion farmer from Embu county training a group of farmers. [Kenya team]
“I have seen the strategy of meeting people on the ground, especially the champions or the lead farmers. You give them a variety to distribute, they will reach the ladies and the men, unlike when we out them in the shops and we ask them to go and pick it. It is obvious that maybe [usually] the man is the one who goes to town so the lady to get that information is not very easy. So […] for us to be equal and for them to get the information equally, let it be near them just at the ground level, and that ground level: the neighbor and that neighbor, the champion farmer”. 
_x000B_(KII, Male (Agronomist), Bungoma district, Kenya, 16 March 2023)
Slide 8:
Key-insights
Women and men involved in varietal decisions need more information (primarily ‚practical‘) to decide which variety meets their preferences and helps them cope with new challenges. 
What could support women and men during decisions in varietal uptake? 
Limited access to information and seeds for certain (gendered) categories hamper equal participation in decisions on varietal uptake. 
How could gender-specific constraints in participation in decision making, access to information, and to seeds be addressed?

This involves providing startups access to research institutes, utilizing infrastructure, and fostering collaboration with students and researchers for testing, validation, and knowledge exchange. The discussion also highlighted the need for robust links between startups and the industry to foster mutual growth. Another critical aspect discussed was scaling and sustainable funding, with a focus on scaling successful solutions, recognizing the low priority of agri-tech funding, and proposing a sustainable funding model to ensure continuous support for the development, growth, and sustainability of innovative agritech solutions. Work Session Lead – Mr. Ram K V Subbarao, Coordinated by - Satish Nagaraji and Ms. Sherin Maria Saji Investment (Recorded message highlights) The recorded message by Manoj Kumar, Founder of Social Alpha, highlights the complexities of investments in agritech, particularly in the context of small and marginalized farmers seeking solutions to enhance income and reduce risks. He emphasizes the diverse stages at which startups in this sector require different types of investments, ranging from early-stage funding to scaling up. Grant capital and non-dilutive capital are identified as crucial for de-risking startups, conducting pilots, and facilitating adoption. Kumar introduces an innovative approach involving government subsidies, philanthropic capital, and evidence creation to bridge affordability gaps in the community. He challenges the mainstream market's perception of investment as a standalone activity, asserting that in agriculture, it is a small but integral piece of the innovation process. Kumar advocates for a holistic approach where investments align with the incentives of the market, community, and state, emphasizing the need to rewrite or redefine the playbook to foster adoption at scale.

www.cgiar.orgResearch and Policy Questions  (WP5 -Nigeria)
•Quality assurance systems: Does seed certification for notified crops 
provide a credible signal to farmers of genetic and physical quality?  
Are farmers willing to pay and demand certified seeds and improve 
varieties? What is the performance of certified seeds and improved 
varieties in different types of farmers’ fields? What is the optimal level 
of certification ?  What role do community seed production 
schemes in filling gaps in access to quality seeds in remote areas?
•Policies: Do seed subsidies induce the desired changes in farmer 
behavior, e.g., increased varietal turnover? What policies and 
institutional arrangements work to incentivize good seed companies 
and screen those bad seed companies? What policies and strategies 
to promote farmers’ experimentation and effective seed demand?

www.cgiar.orgPolicy recommendations 
▪Revisit seed certification target in Nigeria
▪Excessive expansion of certified seed production may not necessarily lead 
to higher use rates or yield outcomes when compared to more moderate 
levels of certified seed production
▪Prioritize spatially the seed certification expansion effort if it is still of policy 
importance:
▪continue research to better identify locations with higher returns to certified 
seeds, given agroecological / socio economic conditions and currently 
popular varieties
▪prioritize in those locations
▪certification capacity enhancement / deployment of inspectors => this may encourage seed 
companies to invest in certified seed production in those areas
▪enforcement capacity (i.e., spot check of certified seeds sold by dealers conducted by NASC)
▪Identify and prioritize where hybrid maize is more widely adopted (so that 
certification efforts shift relatively more to hybrid maize)

Source of raw data: IFPRI/Binomial household survey (2023); and careful matching of local description and local names 
with official release variety names.  It took several discussions and iterations between agrdealeers , ADP extension agents,  
key informant farmers, and the study team . ✓High rate of seed recycling: farmers 
recycle cowpea seeds for 8 years and 
maize seeds for 6 years; with some 
farmers reportedly using own seeds 
since the start of their farming or from 
the parents. 
✓The varieties in the cowpea and maize 
plots are old. Varietal age in cowpea 
farms is 12 years and in maize farms in 
13 years. Newer varieties have not 
caught up in terms of popularity.
✓The most popular cowpea variety is 
Kanannado  (SAMPEA 9), which was 
released in 2005; and the most popular 
maize variety is SAMMAZ 15, released 
in 2008. Estimated adoption rates, zooming in Bauchi 
and Kaduna
Page 17:
www.cgiar.orgKey insight: What is preventing adoption 
of  improved varieties?
161)Limited supply of seeds, especially breeder and foundation seeds; lack of coordination 
and capacity among many seed companies; many inactive seed companies
2)Lack of promotion and exposure by farmers of these new varieties.  Most farmers do 
not know the new varieties
3)Cyclical process of farmers’ generally poor knowledge and practices in farming and seed 
management →low yield being equated with poor seed performance and negative 
perception on seeds being tested →weak culture of experimentation among farmers 
→lack of demand →thin markets [How to break this cycle?]
“Promote, let farmers know and try it.” Extension agent 
“Give small samples for farmers to try…. If other farmers see that they are getting good yield, they will plant that new seed . It will 
spread in the communities quickly.” Agrodealer , Kaduna.
“Of course, we would try new varieties and seeds. Why not? We would love to see how it meets our demands. It will be an 
experience. If the new brand is better than our local one, we will drop ours and embrace the new one. Yes, we will 
welcome it, no doubt….Yes, we would welcome another that can surpass silver brand.” Female FGD
Page 18:
www.cgiar.orgKey insight: What is driving adoption of  
improved varieties?
171)Good varieties that are tested and proven to be better than older varieties; 
2)Adequate supply of quality seeds from breeder seeds to certified seeds; and 
3)Strong promotion of varieties and adequate exposure and testing among 
farmers. 
“… they are available, good quality and affordable. They are still around because they are trusted after testing. They 
were given much more promotion than others.”  Male participant in FGD
“High  yield, Market  value, availability,  early maturing,  low price, advertisement  by producers/  extension,  less diseases .” 
Male participant  in FGD
“Farmers were well sensitized of the qualities and traits of the seeds even before it was brought up.”  Seed company
Page 19:
www.cgiar.orgKey insight: Contextual factors 
Beyond seeds, several contextual factors disable seed actors’ capacity and 
incentive to expand seed production and farmers’ capacity and incentives 
to adopt improved varieties.  
•Security issues, poor soil conditions; high fertilizer cost; transportation, irrigation, and diesel costs are 
some of the major disablers in the seed system and must be addressed. 
•Fertilizer subsidy, integrated soil fertility management, and breeding for nutrient -efficient and low -
fertilizer -demanding varieties are some of the options being reported by farmers and seed actors. 
•Investment in farmers’ education on seed management, good agriculture and management practices, 
and on the value of good seeds and good varieties is needed. When providing information and seed 
samples to try, training on good agricultural practices should be included (not just “dropping seeds”). 
•A culture of experimentation among farmers must be fostered and this can help create seed demand, 
which in turn will help in strengthening commercialization and market transformation for the seed 
system.

ii  Executive Summary  
This is a stakeholder’s workshop report for the Harnessing Gender and Social Equality for Resilience in 
Agrifood  Systems  (HER+)  initiative  conducted  from  9th to 10th February  2023  at the International  Institute 
of Tropical  Agriculture  (IITA),  Dar es Salam,  Tanzania.  The workshop  aimed  to provide  information  needed 
for the HER+  study,  ‘qualitative  assessment  of gender  norms  that constrain  women’s  economic  resilience 
to climate  change  challenges’  that was to be conducted  in Q1 of 2023  in Tanzania  with  value chain  actors 
across the different nodes of cassava, fish, and chicken. The main objective of the workshop, therefore, 
was to identify and map the key stakeholders in the fish, cassava, and chicken value chains and to 
understand the norms that prevent women value  chain actors from becoming economically resilient to 
climate change impacts. In addition, inputs were also obtained from stakeholders on appropriate site 
selection and criteria to select participants for the oncoming fieldwork. Finally, the workshop outpu ts 
were  used  to enrich  the qualitative tools – Individual Interviews,  Key Informants Interviews  (KII),  and Focus 
Groups Discussions (FGDs) - to be implemented during the fieldwork.  
The workshop was attended by 22 participants, comprising 12 women and 10 men, who possessed 
extensive  knowledge  of the selected  value  chains  in the Kigoma,  Kagera,  and Tabora  regions,  which  were 
the targeted research areas for the qualitative study on gender norms. Stakeholders comprised experts 
and, key actors in fish, chicken, and cassava value chains from government departments, Non - 
Government Organizations (NGOs), research institutes, un iversities, private sector producer 
organizations,  and other  value  chain  actors  with  national/regional  perspectives  of the target  value  chains.  
The two -day workshop  agenda included a presentation  on the HER  + initiative, an  introduction  to breakout 
group exercises, and plenary presentations  on the outputs of  the groups’  breakout  sessions. The  workshop 
process  was designed  to be highly  participatory  to generate  ideas  and information  from the experts  and 
the key stakeholders  through  brainstorming  sessions  in the breakout  groups  and plenary.  Break -out group 
exercises were guided by a tool ( Link) designed by the research team (including gender scientists from 
WorldFish, ILRI, and IITA) and facilitated by a member of the field research team. A gallery walk 
presentation of the breakout groups' outputs was deployed to maintain group energy.  
The workshop  tool comprised  of 3 modules:  
Module  1 - ‘Mapping  of value  chains’  aimed  to: identify  actors  in each  node,  their  roles,  norms  that affect 
them,  and their  economic resilience  to climate  change. Module  2 gathered information  on major  events, 
specifically, climate change events that have impacted the value chains, coping mechanisms, and 
economic resilience. Module 3 focused on technology adoption by women and men for climate change 
and associated norms.  
The stakeholders’  workshop  provided  insights  into:  a. climate -related  events  and how  these  affect  women 
and men  in the three  value  chains  of interest. b.  actors  present in  each  node,  their  role,  norms and  other 
constraints that affect them vis -a-vis their economic resilience to climate change challenges. c. how the 
prevailing norms, in particular, constrain the participation of women in the activities along the nodes of 
the value chain and how these constra in affect women’s economic resilience to climate ch ange 
challenges. These insights were gathered for the 3 selected values chains (poultry, cassava, fish).

1. Introduction  
Harnessing Gender and Social Equality for Resilience (HER+) in the Agrifood system is a CGIAR research 
initiative working to achieve climate resilience by strengthening gender equality and social inclusion 
across agri -food systems. The initiative aims to, among other objectives, address restrictive gender and 
social  norms  by engaging  women  and men  together  in Gender  Transformative  Approaches  (GTA)  to tackle 
inequalities  in cassava,  chicken,  and fish value  chains  in Tanzania.  GTAs  are ways  to intervene  in Agrifood 
Systems  (AFS)  at deeper  levels  by targeting  structures  that create  social  inequalities,  e.g.,  restrictive  norms 
that for example, block women’s access to financial services and entrepreneurship opportunities. In the 
2022 –2024  cycle,  Work  Package  1 (WP1)  will help  AFS stakeholders  identify  leverage  points  and levers  to 
reduce  normative  constraints  that limit  women’s  capacities  to build  economic  resilience  to CC challenges. 
The evidence  will be used  to design  and implement  GTAs  with  CGIAR  Initiatives  and partners  to overcome 
these constraints. WP1 will help harness and package the learning to accelerate the widespread 
application of GTAs within the AR4D ecosystem.  
HER+ initiative contributes to One CGIAR’s five impact areas: 1) Climate adaptation and mitigation; 2) 
Environmental health and biodiversity; 3) Gender equality, youth, and social inclusion; 4) Nutrition, health, 
and food security; and 5) Poverty reduction , livelihoods, and jobs. As One CGIAR grows stronger  
Page 8:
5  the implementation of its activities is designed to be delivered under different initiatives, one of them is 
to catalyze resilience in the Agrifood system in East and Southern Africa.  
In Tanzania, the norms assessments was conducted in three value chains; fish, cassava, and chicken, in 
the Kagera, Kigoma and Tabora regions.  
The main  objectives  of the stakeholders’  workshop  were  to get stakeholders'  inputs  in; (i) Identifying  and 
mapping the key stakeholders in the value chains of interest (ii) Identifying the norms that constrain 
women  and other  groups  from  working  in the different  nodes  of the value  chain  (iii) Examining  the major 
climatic events  that have impacted value  chain  actors, their coping mechanisms  and economic resilience 
and (iv) Examining the adoption of climate -smart technology by men and women AFS actors  
 
2. Workshop  participants,  program,  and process  
The workshop was attended by 22 participants, comprising 12 women and 10 men, with extensive 
knowledge  of the selected  value  chains  in the Kigoma,  Kagera,  and Tabora  regions, the  targeted  research 
areas (Appendix 1). Participants included gender experts in fish, chicken, and cassava value chains from 
government departments, Non -Government Organizations (NGOs), research institutes, universities, the 
private sector, representatives of produce r organizations, and value chain actors with national/regional 
persp ectives of the three value chains.  
The two-day workshop  agenda  included  a presentation  on the HER + initiative,  introductions  to breakout 
group exercises, and plenary presentations on the breakout group outputs. At the end of the workshop, 
an evaluation  was held  to get participants'  feedback  on the workshop  content  and process  as well as their 
commitment to future involvement in the project (Appendix 2).  
Break -out group exercises were guided by a tool designed by the research team. The tool had three 
modules: (i) Mapping of value chains: actors in each node, their roles, norms that affect them, and their 
economic resilience to climate change (ii) Backgroun d information on major events and specifically 
climate change events that have impacted the Value Chain of interest: major climate events, coping 
mechanisms,  and economic  resilience,  (iii) Focus  on technology  adoption  by women  and men  for climate 
change  and associated  norms.  Breakout  sessions  were  facilitated  by a member  of the field  research  team 
and the stakeholders followed the steps given to do the exercises.  
The workshop process was designed to be highly participatory to generate ideas and information from 
the experts and key stakeholders through, brainstorming sessions in the breakout groups and plenary. 
Gallery walks presentation of the breakout group's outp uts was deployed to maintain group energy.  
 
 
 
3. Opening  sessions  
After an introductory and warm -up session, participants were asked to get to know each other and 
then briefly agree on the major impacts of climate change on their respective value chains and 
associated gender implications. Figure 6 presents the issues rai sed by the three value chain groups.

Opening  remarks  were  then  provided  as follows.  
 
3.1 Dr. Regina  Kapinga  opening  remarks  and presentation  on One  CGIAR  in Tanzania  
The opening of the workshop was officiated by Dr. Regina Kapinga, (CGIAR Country Convenor, Tanzania) 
who took the opportunity to present One CGIAR's identity, framework, research strategy, partnerships, 
and funding structure. Dr. Kapinga noted that the Con sortium Group of International Agricultural Research 
Centres (CGIAR) has a long history in Tanzania (over three decades). A recent development of CGIAR is the 
formation of One CGIAR, a strategic partnership of international institutions/Centres dedicated  to 
advancing  Science  and technology  to address  the central  development  challenges  namely:  - 
• Reducing  rural  poverty,  
Page 10:
7  • Improving  food  security,  
• Improving  nutrition  and health,  
• Sustainably  managing  and utilizing  natural  resources  and 
• Resilience  to climate  change  
 
The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has a well -established infrastructure in terms of 
office  space  in Tanzania  and has been  given  the 
mandate of convening One CGIAR activities in 
Tanzania.  Dr. Kapinga  emphasized  that One CGIAR  has 
several centers, several initiatives, and bilateral 
projects,  working  closely  with  the national  Agricultural 
Sector Development Program coordination unit to 
ensure alignment with country priority themes. Key 
highlights  from  Dr. Kapinga’s  presentation  included:  
Global Impact areas (Figure 1), One CGIAR major 
themes (Figure 2), Samples of innovations ready to 
scale for impact (Figure 3), One CGIAR initiative in 
Tanzania  (Figure  4), and Partnerships  between  CG and 
Non -CG Actors  (Figure  5). Photo  1 Dr. Regina  Kapinga,  One CGIAR  Convenor  Tanzania

Dr. Kapinga  reiterated  One CGIAR's  efforts  to ensure  that all initiatives  are aligned  with  the ASDP  II priority 
themes and areas. She said there are no changes to the research mandate of the individual 
institutes/Centres but rather changes in working modalities for better coordination, alignment, 
collaboration, implementation, and co -mobilization of resourc es for a common goal. Projected 
investment  in Tanzania  for 2022  – 2024  stands  at USD67.4  million  for Bilateral  projects  and USD102  million 
for pooled  One CGIAR  funding.  Dr. Kapinga’s  full presentation  can be accessed  through  the following  link. 
 
 
3.2 Overview of the HER+ Initiative by Dr Steven Cole, Senior Scientist and Coordinator of 
Gender Research at IITA  
Dr. Steven Cole, the Work Package 1 - ‘TRANSFORM’ team lead, presented an overview of the HER + 
initiative. The initiative is mapped under the Gender Equality, Youth and Social inclusion, One CGIAR 
impact  area. HER  + initiative's outcome  is, by  2024, National agencies,  Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), 
and CGIAR initiatives in Nigeria and Tanzania target normative constraints, that limit the capacities of 
women food -system actors to build economic resilience to climate change challenges. The initiative wi ll 
use Gender Transformative Approaches (GTA) which are ways to intervene in food systems at a deeper 
level by targeting normative constraints and building critical consciousness. A glossary of terms used in 
this workshop and in implementing the project is  listed in Appendix 3 for common understanding.  
The innovative research focuses on three steps, (i) Assessments of unequal norms that restrict women 
from  building  economic  resilience  to CC challenges,  (ii) Identify  leverage  points  and levers  to intervene  for 
deeper -level change and (iii) Design and test gender transformative approaches (GTAs) with partners. 
Research  in Nigeria  and Tanzania  suggests  that there  are norms  that constrain,  especially  women,  and 
Page 13:
3  their  abilities  to become  economically 
empowered in various ways. Dr. Cole 
noted the challenges being addressed 
in the focal countries are patriarchal 
systems of gender inequality and 
discriminatory social institutions. Dr. 
Cole’s  presentation  can be accessed  at

4. Module  1: Mapping  of value  chain  
actors in each node, their roles, norms that affect them, and their economic resilience to climate  
change.  
 
4.1 Introduction  to the Breakout  Group  exercise  by Dr. Jumoke  Adeyeye  
Dr. Jumoke Adeyeye  introduced  the Breakout  Group  exercise  by taking 
participants  through  the steps  described  in the working  tool developed 
by the research  team.  The tool used  describes  in detail  the group  tasks, 
and the process to be followed in  each of the three modules. The tool - 
type document can be accessed at the following link. Dr. Adeyeye 
described the mapping process, involving five steps, and informed 
participants  that the exercise  will be guided  by the questions  in the tool. 
She indicated that there are research team members assigned to the 
three  groups  to support  with  notetaking  and for clarification  if need  be. 
 
The mapping  exercise's  five steps  are: 
• Step 1: Actor mapping: Map who is doing what and in which 
node of the VC.  
• Step  2: Activity  mapping  
• Step 3: Identify chain supporters such as financial service 
providers like bankers, extension agents, and other service 
providers and

• Step  4: Identify  the different  norms  that serve  as opportunities  or constraints  for men  and women.  
• Step  5: Zoom  in on norms  and economic  resilience.  Go deeper  into the norms  and discuss  whether 
they  are enabling  for men  or women  but also if the effects  are equally  the same  in the two gender 
categories.

Preamble  
The three break -out groups, formed according to the value chain of interest (Table 1), worked on the 
exercise for Module 1 i.e. Mapping of the value chain based on the guideline in Work Package Tool type 1 
- described in section 4.1. At the end of the exer cise, the groups presented their findings in plenary.

4.2.1 Mapping  of the Fish Value  Chain  
The Fish value chain group  identified three main nodes: pre -harvesting, harvesting, and post -harvesting. 
Figure 6, 7, and 8 show the main actors and the activities at the three nodes identified by the group 
members.  
 
Figure  7 Fish value  chain  mapping  – Pre-harvesting  node  
Page 15:

Figure  8 Fish value  chain  mapping  - Harvesting  
Young men dominate harvesting nodes because  work  in these nodes is done at  night and involves diving 
in deep  waters;  both  timing  and activity  are considered  appropriate  for young  men  only.  The gender  norm 
that was found  to be associated  with  this activity  is: ‘it  is not appropriate  for women to  work  outside  the 
homestead at night’.  
 
Figure  9 Fish value  chain  mapping  - Post  harvesting  
The reasons  behind  the different  roles  between  men  and women  discussed  by the group  members  were:  
• In general,  older  men  dominate  pre-harvesting  because  this node  requires  heavy  capital  
investment, knowledge, and experience, which most women lack. Associated norms include:  
Page 16:
6  o It is not appropriate  for a woman  to access  and use loan/credit  without  seeking 
permission from the husband.  
o It is not appropriate for  a woman  to make  decisions  over  the use of family  resources. 
• Harvesting  is dominated  by young  men.  Associated  norms  include:  
o It is not appropriated  for a woman  to be out of her home  at night  for work 
o It is inappropriate  for a woman  to go and fish offshore  (in the lake). 
o Old men  and women  should  not risk by  engaging  in fish harvesting  in the lake 
o Old men and women should leave diving and hauling to young men who have enough 
physical strength.  
 
• Women dominate post -harvesting in sorting, cleaning, and carrying fish loads to marketplaces. 
Associated norms are:  
o It is inappropriate  for a man  to engage  in the sorting  of sardines  (dagaa ) because  it is 
women’s  job","8073"

General Overview  
Tunisia is currently facing significant challenges in livestock feed resources, exacerbated by 
climate change and drought. The region of Kebili, specialized in date production through its 
oasis, offers various products such as downgraded dates, date pits, pedicels, and palm leaves. 
Despite the abundance of high or moderate energy biomasses, Kebili faces a significant 
challenge in terms of protein resources for animal feeding. Also,  the “know -how” in terms of 
valorization of these resources is relatively limited. This underscores the crucial need for 
technical expertise and innovation. In this context, the workshop on the development and 
valorization of local forage resources in Kebili a imed to equip participants to optimize the use 
of date palm by -products, reduce feed deficits, decrease dependence on imports, and 
promote sustainable agricultural practices. Special emphasis is placed on harnessing local 
resources for livestock feed, high lighting its importance for the economic and agricultural 
development of the region.  
General Objectives  
The general objective of the workshop was to improve participants' comprehension and 
abilities in optimizing the utilization of date palm by -products as feed sources for livestock.  
The report summarizes a two -day workshop in Kebili, focusing on the development and 
optimization of local forage resources, specifically date palm by -products. It highlights the

Page 3 of 7  potential for growth in utilizing these by -products and underscores the need to address 
knowledge gaps for sustainable agricultural practices in the region.  
Specific objectives   
The specific objectives of this workshop were to understand the practices employed in the 
valorization of date palm by -products, to explore different formulations, and to identify 
associated challenges through field visits to private livestock farmers, far mers' associations 
(Groupements de Développement Agricole - GDAs), and concentrated feed manufacturing 
units. Furthermore, the workshop aimed to provide participants with a comprehensive 
technical training session focused on the valorization of date palm b y-products, emphasizing 
the nutritional values of different parts of the date palm, such as date pulp, kernels, leaves, 
and stems. It also intends to showcase various formulations to produce feed pellets utilizing 
these by -products. Lastly, the workshop ai med to facilitate discussions among participants, 
to address specific scientific problems related to the valorization of date palm by -products 
and to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing.  
Specific outputs  
Fifty -six stakeholders, including 20 women and 36 men, representing diverse sectors such as 
scientists, local extension agents, private sector actors, and research and development 
institutions, actively participated in the workshop. Among these participant s, sixteen farmers, 
including five women, were invited. The primary focus of the workshop was the dissemination 
of valuable information on the nutritional benefits inherent in various by -products of date 
palm, highlighting their potential in formulating an imal feed. The collaborative nature of the 
workshop fostered problem -solving discussions, thus promoting connections among 
participants. This collaboration is expected to lead to the development of innovative 
formulations for animal feed pellets, thereby c ontributing to the strengthening of networks 
and the widespread adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, particularly in the efficient 
utilization of date palm by -products. Regarding Professor Nizar Moujahed's presentation, his 
intervention played a  crucial role in enriching the participants' knowledge. His informed 
perspectives provided a profound understanding of the opportunities offered by the

INTRODUCCIÓN  
 
El Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (MARN) , a través de la Dirección de Cambio Climático , en coordinación 
con el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores (MINEX) , el Instituto Guatemalteco de Migración (IGM) y el Programa 
Regional sobre Migración (WHP por sus siglas en inglés) de la Organización Internacional para las Migraciones (OIM), 
realizó el Segundo  Foro Nacional sobre Migración y Cambio Climático , el 26 de julio 2023 . A través de espacios de 
coordinación para el abordaje de los efectos del cambio climático en la migración , este año , se suma  al Foro  la Alianza 
de Bioversity y CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical), el Instituto Internacional de Investigación sobre 
Políticas Alimentarias (IFPRI) y el CGIAR FOCUS Seguridad Climática así como las iniciativas de One CGIAR de la 
Resiliencia Climática ClimBer, Fragilidad, Conflicto y Migración (FCM) y la iniciativa regional integrada A griLAC, la 
Universidad del Valle de Guatemala y la Plataforma de Desplazamientos por Desastres (PDD) a través del proyecto 
. 
En seguimiento a la Hoja de Ruta elaborada como resultado del primer foro sobre migración y cambio climático del 
año 2022, y, en consulta con MARN, MINEX e IGM se decidió realizar un Segundo Foro sobre Migración y Cambio 
Climático con la participación de entidades de investigación , instituciones públicas  y agencias de l Sistema de  Naciones 
Unidas.  A este Foro asistieron más de 50 personas de 29 distintas instituciones públicas, centros académicos, 
organizaciones sociales y agencias de Naciones Unidas.  
En esta ocasión los centros de investigación y entidades de generación de información han tenido una participación 
clave, ya que han dado a conocer las metodologías, modelos estadísticos y escenarios que permiten proyectar  a futuro 
las condiciones en las que Guatemala se encontrará frente a los efectos del cambio climático. Se ha evidenciado la 
importancia de seguir invirtiendo en investigación que permita tener información basada en evidencia para la 
formulación acertada d e políticas públicas, pero también , se ha evidenciado que la atención de las necesidades de las 
poblaciones vulnerables es el principal reto.  
De por sí las condiciones físicas de los suelos a nivel nacional son de vocación forestal, lo que ha dificultado la 
productividad de la agricultura de subsistencia  y cultivos anuales . La transformación de los medios de vida frente a los 
efectos del cambio climático avizora  escenarios peligrosos para las áreas rurales que viven principalmente de esta 
actividad.  Frente a ello , las condiciones sociales actuales no contribuyen a mejorar los escenarios, al contrario,  hay que 
tomarlos muy en cuenta en la identifi cación de medidas de adaptación y mitigación frente a  las pérdidas y los daños.  
Este esfuerzo se realizó gracias al apoyo del Oficina  de Población , Refugiados  y Migración del Departamento de Estado 
de los Estados Unidos  de América .

Para establecer la modalidad del Segundo Foro Nacional se instituyó  un comité técnico organizador conformado 
inicialmente por la Dirección de C ambio  Climático del MARN , la Dirección de Asuntos Migratorios del MINEX, la 
Dirección de Protección del IGM  y del Programa Regional sobre Migración , de la OIM . A partir de marzo 2023 , se 
realizaron una serie de reuniones de coordinación para identificar el contenido del foro y  a través de la mesa de trabajo 
de Movilidad Humana y Cambio Climático  de la Estrategia Migratoria Intersectorial , se realizó la consulta con sus 
integrantes sobre el interés de participar como ponentes en este segundo foro.  
 
Por su lado la OIM , tuvo acercamiento con la Universidad del Valle de Guatemala y  la Alianza de Bioversity y el CIAT 
(Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical), para solicitar el apoyo en la  presentación de resultados de sus diferentes 
estudios.  
 
De esa cuenta se conformaron  tres (3) paneles de presentaciones conformados de la siguiente manera:  
 
Panel 1 , bajo la moderación de la OIM:  
• Acciones Nacionales sobre Cambio Climático (NDC, Comunicaciones, Políticas) ; por parte del MARN.  
• La ciencia detrás del nexo entre Cambio Climático y Movilidad Humana ; por parte de la UVG.  
• Resultados de l mapeo de instituciones e instrumentos de política en cambio climático, seguridad alimentaria y 
migración en Guatemala ; por parte de Alliance of Bioversity International y el CIAT.  
 
Panel 2, bajo la moderación de la Alliance Bioversity  International y  el CIAT : 
• El Observatorio  de Seguridad Climática: Examinando el nexo entre cambio climático, seguridad y movilidad 
humana ; por Alliance Bioversity  y el CIAT.  
• Factores climáticos asociados a la migración en Guatemala ; por IFPRI, AgriLAC Resilente.  
• Actualización del Plan Nacional de Respuesta, la función de atención a personas migrante s (función No. 9);  por 
SE CONRED.  
• Pronóstico e información de l histórico de datos hidrometeorológicos en el país ; por Instituto Nacional de 
Sismología, Vulcanología, meteorología e Hidrología ( INSIVUMEH ).

PALABRAS DE BIENVENIDA  
POR REPRESENTANTES INSTITUCIONALES  
 
 
 
 
Dos de las prioridades identificadas en el  primer  Foro, son; la necesidad de coordinar 
con el sector académico y la necesidad de fortalecer la coordinación 
interinstitucional , a través de mecanismos y espacios que permitan el diálogo y 
propuestas para el abordaje de este tema , que es  de importancia a nivel nacional.  
 
El fenómeno del desplazamiento por cambio climático es cada vez  más una realidad,  
pero saber del desafío  no es suficiente  para poder enfrentarlo , se nec esita de 
evidencia científica y una contribución técnica clave que alimente políticas públicas  eficientes , realistas , 
encaminadas a una nueva realidad. Se agradece el interés  y acompañamiento  de la academia y al selecto 
grupo de panelistas por aceptar la invitación.
  
 
Joaquim Torrinha , Coordinador de Programa , 
Organización Internacional para las Migraciones  
 
 
 
 
La inclusión del sector académico es importante , ya que forma parte de la promesa de nuevos 
profesionales y generación de evidencia científica.  
 
Como lo dice la ciencia política , cuando se habla de Estado, éste está conformado por el 
gobierno,  la población y  el territorio ; en ese sentido transversalmente pasa el Cambio 
Climático. El país tie ne estructuras, políticas, estrategias, ya definidas en gran medida.  
 
También , el tema de migración  es un fenómeno importante para Guatemala, considerando 
que el país  a nivel regional  se está convirtiendo en un punto estratégico sobre  este tema.

El Cambio Climático es una realidad que está transformando vidas y ha exacerbado 
los desafíos que enfrentan las poblaciones a lo largo del territorio guatemalteco , 
impulsando la movilidad humana  que muchas veces coloca en riesgo las vidas , cuando 
la migración se lleva a cabo de manera irregular.  
 
Como Estado miembro de la Conferencia Regional sobre Migración (CRM) , 
Guatemala , ha participado  en el taller sobre movilidad en contextos de desastres , degradación ambiental 
y cambio climático , su participación ha permitido reconocer al país  como un referente regional en el 
abordaje de movilidad humana y cambio climático.

La migración provocada por efectos del cambio climático no solo es local, tiene 
implicaciones a nivel regional y global . En la región se enfrentan desafíos similares y 
es necesario trabajar en conjunto para encontrar soluciones sostenibles. Es 
responsabilidad de nuestra i nstitución y de todos los actores involucrados 
comprender la complejidad de esta situación y actuar de manera solidaria, 
humanitaria , donde debemos brindar protección y apoyo a aquellos que se ven 
obligados a abandonar sus hogares , debido a las consecuencias , que, en algunos 
casos irreversibles , son provocados por esta problemática ambiental.

LA RELACIÓN ENTRE LA  MIGRACIÓN  
EL CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO  
 
Para la OIM es importante el abordaje de este nexo , no solo por la solicitud de los Estados a nivel regional, sino también 
por ese conocimiento adquirido a través de la asistencia prestada a las personas migrantes.  
 
A nivel nacional se ha considerado importante este abordaje desde la OIM por lo siguiente:  
1. Guatemala forma parte de uno de los principales corredores migratorios en el mundo y la cercanía a  Estados 
Unidos , la convierte en un punto estratégico . 
2. A través de estudios y observaciones se puede determinar que el cambio del ambiente puede tener incidencia 
en los procesos migratorios.  
3. En Guatemala gran parte de la población depende de la agricultura como un medio de subsistencia.  
4. En las áreas rurales gran parte de los hogares no cuenta con una diversificación de sus ingresos ; esto genera 
impactos a sus recursos naturales , lo que  afecta  en la producción de los alimentos, etc.  
 
Según la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático. Este se le atribuye directa e 
indirectamente a la actividad humana que altera la composición de la atmósfera mundial y que se suma a la vulnerabilidad 
natural del clima observada d urante periodos de tiempo comparables.  
 
La variabilidad climática debido al cambio climático tiene incidencia en:  
1. La frecuencia e intensidad de huracanes.  
2. Aumento del nivel del mar.  
 
La vulnerabilidad ante el cambio climático influye en cómo las personas deciden utilizar sus territorios , en como  hacen 
frente o no a esos cambios ambientales. Muchas veces las poblaciones más vulnerables son las que quedan atrapadas 
en lugares donde la producción de alimentos  es muy difícil y, en consecuencia , quedan en una situación de inseguridad 
alimentaria, tal es el caso de algunas comunidades ubicadas en el área del corredor seco en Guatemala.  
 
Se sabe que el primer miembro de la familia que migra hacia otro lugar son los hombres adultos y son las mujeres 
quienes deben quedarse haciéndole frente a situaciones muy difíciles.  
 
Dentro del análisis es muy importante considerar el papel de las mujeres, las niñas y los niños. También es importante 
considerar los procesos de urbanización y migración interna.  
 
Page 10:
 10 Los estudios que se centran en determinados fenómenos ambientales o lugares han aportado valiosas perspectivas 
sobre el tema. La principal conclusión que se desprende de estos estudios es que las respuestas  a los factores que 
impulsan el cambio ambiental , en materia de movilidad , dependen fuertemente del contexto.  
 
La migración puede analizarse y comprenderse utilizando diferentes escalas o espectros. En el ámbito de la migración 
por motivos ambientales, destacan las siguientes categorías (Naik, 2009):  
 
Forzoso – Voluntario , Temporal – Permanente , Cercano – Lejano  y Vulnerable – Resiliente  
 
No se trata de categorías opuestas, sino de categorías complementarias.  
 
 
Por último, es importante considerar que la migración debe ser analizada en diferentes niveles que hemos denominado 
el nivel macro, el nivel micro y el nivel meso.  
 
El nivel macro : lo constituyen los factores causales y tiene que ver con la política, la 
economía, el ambiente, la demografía, lo social (en algunos casos lo cultural y otros).  
 
El nivel micro:  tiene que ver con las características de las personas o del hogar que 
determinan también la facilidad o la dificultad de la migración. Entre estos están la edad, la 
etnia, el idioma, la preferencia sexual, la educación, los ingresos económicos , entre otros.  
 
El nivel meso:  son los obstáculos y facilitadores directos de la migración como lo son: las 
redes sociales migratorias, la ubicación geográfica o distancia del lugar de destino, el costo 
de los traslados, los medios propios para pagar ese costo del traslado, entre otros .

PANEL 1  
Moderador: Alejandro Martínez, OIM  
Expositores: Ing. Saúl Pérez, MARN, Dr. Diego Pons, UVG, Sara Collazos y Edith Robledo, 
Alliance of Bioversity  International  y el CIAT  
 
Acciones Nacionales sobre Cambio Climático  
(NDC, Comunicaciones, Políticas)  
Exposición de Ingeniero Saúl Pérez  del MARN  
 
Entre 2023 y 2027 la temperatura media global anual cercana a la superficie oscilará entre 1.1 
  1.8 grados superiores 
a la media de 1850 y 1990.  
 
La temperatura de la superficie va a superar la temperatura, que se pudo observar durante 50 años, en apenas 5 años. 
Los próximos 5 años serán los más cálidos jamás registrados.  
 
En 2022 el consejo de Seguridad de Estados Unidos identificó a nivel mundial a 
los países más vulnerables frente a los efectos del cambio climático. El 
observatorio Germanwatch coloca a Guatemala en el número 16 de 20 países 
más vulnerables a efectos del c ambio climático.  
 
El mapa de la vulnerabilidad nacional ante el cambio climático del MARN identifica 
a los departamentos de Quiché, Huehuetenango y Alta Verapaz como los 
departamentos más vulnerables, estos departamentos también reportan una 
frecuente migración irregular.  
 
La vulnerabilidad del país se compone de varios factores: 1. la posición geográfica, 2. la condición de los suelos que es 
de vocación forestal y no de vocación de cultivos limpios, lo que causa agotamiento e inseguridad alimentaria y 3. el 
crecimiento demo gráfico (creciente demanda de servicios).  
 
Page 12:
 12 El efecto invernadero es una actividad natural que en perfecto equilibrio permite la vida sobre la superficie de la tierra. 
Pero debido a las acciones antropogénicas, los gases de efecto invernadero (GEI), alteran la composición de la atmósfera 
y a la vez se produce el calentamiento global. En comparación a las emisiones globales las de Guatemala son mínimas, 
llegando apenas al 0.08%; lo que, en otros países, como China, sobrepasan el 35%. Sin embargo, el Estado de Guatemala, 
a través del Gobierno por medio del MARN, realiza esfuerzos para reducir sus GEI como parte los compromisos 
asumidos en el Acuerdo de Paris de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas de Cambio Climático.  
 
En el 2009 se realizó la Política Nacional de Cambio Climático que dio paso a la Ley Marco de Cambio Climático y se 
crea el Plan de Acción Nacional ante Cambio Climático y la Estrategia Nacional de Desarrollo con bajas emisiones 
enfocada a la reducción de emisiones de GEI. También se cuenta con un mapa nacional de vulnerabilidad ante el cambio 
climático. Se ha elaborado la primera, segunda y tercera comunicación nacional de cambio climático que permiten la 
actualización de las Contribuciones Nacionalmente D eterminadas (NDC). El PANCC incluye un capítulo sobre 
movilidad humana con 3 indicadores relacionados al fortalecimiento de políticas públicas, fortalecimiento de capacidades 
institucionales y generación de datos e información.  
 
En el primer foro sobre migración y cambio climático se identificaron tres necesidades relacionadas a la coordinación 
interinstitucional, fortalecimiento de capacidades y generación de evidencia.  
 
En seguimiento a la CMNUCC el Comité Ejecutivo estableció un Grupo de Trabajo sobre Desplazamiento (TFD). En 
la posición de país presentada en la COP 27 se habló sobre la importancia de abordar en Guatemala el nexo de la 
migración por efectos del cambio climático. Los efectos del cambio climático se evidencian en la aparición de plagas, 
agotamiento de los suelos, escasez de medios p ara la producción de alimentos, por lo que las personas de las 
poblaciones afectadas tienden a desplazarse hacia otros territorios para garantizar su seguridad alimentaria.

 13 La Ciencia detrás del Nexo entre Cambio Climático y  
Movilidad Humana. Qué sugiere y qué no sugiere la evidencia  
 
Exposición de Doctor Diego Pons  de UVG  
 
En el marco del Pacto Global para la Migración Ordenada, Segura y Regular es importante considerar: 1. la creación de 
condiciones sostenibles de los medios de vida en comunidades de origen y 2. Datos desglosados en aspectos relevantes 
incluyendo el impacto  económico, ambiental y social.  
 
Según el último censo nacional, en el altiplano central y parte del corredor seco occidental y oriental existe una alta 
emigración. En las comunidades de estas regiones las actividades económicas son: la agricultura de subsistencia, la 
prestación de mano d e obra en fincas de café y caña azúcar, el comercio y las remesas. Para crear condiciones 
sostenibles de estas actividades o medios de vida en estas regiones, es importante resaltar que la mayoría de los suelos 
de esa región son de vocación forestal, no ap tas para la siembra y con pendientes inclinadas. En la región norte del país 
los suelos presentan casi las mismas características, mas no así en el área sur del país.  
 
El principal impedimento para crear condiciones sostenibles de los medios de vida es principalmente la vocación de los 
suelos, ya que tiene una capacidad reducida y se requiere una alta inversión para lograr que los suelos generen un 
rendimiento a través d e la agricultura. Esto es ya una desventaja.  
 
El recurso hídrico en estas regiones se basa en recursos superficiales vulnerables al riesgo de sequias por temperaturas 
elevadas. Los sistemas de riego para diferentes cultivos deben funcionar durante todo el año, como lo es el caso de la 
caña, mientras q ue los cultivos de subsistencia se irrigan de abril a agosto (dependen del agua de lluvia). Las poblaciones 
con cultivos de subsistencia migran internamente a otros lugares para prestar sus servicios, tal es el caso de las fincas 
cafetaleras.  
 
Hay condiciones climáticas en Guatemala que pronostican una disminución en este cultivo (53% de la pérdida del área), 
por lo que este medio de vida podría no ser sostenible. Aunado a esta situación hay crisis en los cultivos por plagas, 
como la roya, la cu al está asociada al cambio de temperaturas.  
 
Según estudios, la capacidad de adaptación en Centroamérica es poca mayormente en la región occidental y la región 
del norte. Lo cual está asociado a la oportunidad de acceder a recursos económicos (créditos financieros, 
infraestructura, acceso a educación, etc.).  
 
La tendencia del incremento de la temperatura terrestre global siempre es al alza y el incremento de las temperaturas 
de la superficie del mar presentan anomalías severas sobre todo en el atlántico norte, lo que incide en el incremento 
de lluvias en Guatem ala. Actualmente se están presentando aumento de lluvias durante el fenómeno del niño, lo cual 
no es usual. Estas temperaturas están fuera del histórico normal.  
 
Page 14:
 14 A nivel nacional los desastres relacionados a fenómenos naturales se incrementan (sequias, inundaciones y 
deslizamientos). En el caso de Huehuetenango y Quiché (comunidades de origen) la temperatura media ha 
incrementado a partir de la década de los años 7 0. También la duración y magnitud de la canícula se ha incrementado 
y ha afectado, los cultivos (caña de azúcar y cultivos anuales), los pastos y los bosques. Las poblaciones mayormente 
afectadas son aquellas en donde hay niveles de pobrezas altos (Huehuet enango y parte de Las Verapaces) poblaciones 
de la costa sur y poblaciones mayas con alta vulnerabilidad nutricional.  
 
Los escenarios futuros predicen el aumento de temperatura durante la canícula hasta en 2 grados centígrados y 
disminuciones de la precipitación pluvial en la región norte y se extenderá el área del corredor seco y habrá incremento 
de la aridez en la costa sur y norte del país.  
 
Desde el año 2010 ha habido un decremento de la cobertura vegetal en el país e impactando en la seguridad alimentaria.  
 
No hay datos de la afectación del cambio climático en poblaciones migrantes en tránsito, ni en comunidades de destino 
y hay que considerar a poblaciones en riesgo que no tienen medios para movilizarse (poblaciones atrapadas).  
 
Si no hay datos ante la hipótesis de la migración por efectos del cambio climático este hecho no se puede comprobar. 
En Guatemala, la información para establecer el nexo entre migración y cambio climático es limitada y la que existe, no 
es consistente.  
 
El método CHIRPS ofrece datos de precipitación basada en información satelital, que no capta lo que realmente sucede 
en campo. Las estaciones meteorológicas tienen sus sesgos.  
 
¿Hacia dónde debemos ir?  
Es necesaria la elaboración de estudios actualizados que aborden el nexo entre cambio climático y migración, darle 
prioridad a los que se están empezando a generar. Esta evidencia permitirá la elaboración de políticas públicas que 
respondan a la realidad a ctual del país.  
 
En uno de los estudios recientes se identificó que una de las variables que mayormente explica la migración irregular es 
el nivel de escolaridad formal de las poblaciones. A mayor nivel de escolaridad menor es la probabilidad de migrar. Es 
este mismo estudio la sequía a parece en la posición No. 10 como factor de impulsión de la migración. Por lo que es 
importante observar otras determinantes sociales que tiene que ver con la decisión de migrar de manera irregular.

  Conclusiones:  
• El cambio y la variabilidad climática afectan grandemente los procesos agrícolas en el país y se espera que 
esto continúe en las siguientes décadas.  
• Los medios de vida de las comunidades migrantes son complejos y aunque incluyen sistemas agrícolas, deben 
explorarse transformaciones de los medios de vida de cara a los escenarios de clima.  
• La evidencia sugiere que cuando las comunidades migrantes tienen mayor nivel educativo, estas tienden a 
migrar menos, pues han diversificado las opciones de sus medios de vida.  
• Se requieren muchos más datos, información y análisis para generar más evidencia sobre los nexos en el 
tema.

 16 Mapeo de instituciones e instrumentos de política en cambio 
climático, seguridad alimentaria y migración en Guatemala  
 
Exposición de Sara Collazos y Edith Robledo, Alliance of Bioversity International,  
la CIAT y el CIMMYT  
 
AgriLAC Resilente  trabaja en cinco áreas: clima y nutrición, agricultura digital, competitividad en bajas emisiones, 
innovación y escalamiento y políticas, inversiones e instituciones basadas en la ciencia.  
 
El mapeo de instituciones e instrumentos de política en Guatemala se basa en la metodología de CIMMYT llamada 
Iniciativa de Sistemas Agroalimentarios Integrados que tiene tres pasos: 1. Dónde estamos, 2. Hacia dónde vamos y 3. 
Cómo lograr un futuro mejor y  como se vincula con en el primer paso.  
 
Para este mapeo se consultó a instituciones de gobierno, asociaciones de agricultores, academia y agencias de 
cooperación en Guatemala para identificar áreas de oportunidad.  
 
El hallazgo general es que al 2023 Guatemala cuenta con 32 instrumentos de política (planes, estrategias, leyes, políticas, 
etc. de seguridad alimentaria, cambio climático y migración. 19 de ellas están relacionadas con cambio climático, 11 con 
seguridad a limentaria y 2 con migración. Uno de los objetivos es integrar los nexos entre estos temas a través de diseños 
institucionales y políticas.  
 
Guatemala es uno de los primeros países que crea su política y otros instrumentos sobre cambio climático. Algunos 
instrumentos de política de seguridad alimentaria consideran como subtema el cambio climático. Si bien hay multiplicidad 
de proyectos de migra ción en Guatemala, solo hay dos instrumentos de política en este tema.  
 
Los desafíos y oportunidades en estos tres temas son:  
1. Fortalecimiento de sistemas de evaluación y monitoreo de las políticas, así como la generación de datos.  
2. La creación y fortalecimiento de espacios intersectoriales para revisar, actualizar y armonizar instrumentos de 
políticas con los tres temas, el seguimiento de mecanismos de coordinación institucional, fortalecimiento de 
capacidades de funcionarios.  
3. Financiamiento para aplicación de políticas: asignación de presupuesto, capacitación para gestión de financiamiento 
y formulación de propuestas para acceder a fondos financieros.  
 
Es importante seguir posicionando en la agenda pública el nexo de la migración internacional e interna con los efectos 
del cambio climático; y que, la política de cambio climático incluya la migración.

• Cómo el cambio climático puede afectar a las causas raíz de la inseguridad;  
• Cómo la inseguridad puede repercutir en la resiliencia climática.  
 
Nuestro objetivo es comprender cómo la transformación de los sistemas agroalimentarios puede contribuir a mejorar 
los esfuerzos de construcción de paz al tiempo que se aborda la inseguridad alimentaria, se hace frente a las 
desigualdades sociales y se pote ncia la acción por el clima.  
 
Para lograr una resiliencia sistémica, es importante abordar los riesgos y desafíos causados por el nexo de la seguridad 
climática.  
 
¿Por qué es importante?  
La mayoría de las personas que sufren inseguridad alimentaria crónica están en zonas frágiles y en conflicto. Dichas 
zonas, con altos índices de inseguridad alimentaria, suelen ser altamente vulnerables al cambio climático.  
 
Los enfoques tradicionales de adaptación al cambio climático no son suficientes. Las respuestas de mal -adaptación al 
cambio climático exacerban aún más las causas de la inseguridad y las tensiones La resiliencia no puede lograrse sin paz 
y estabilidad. Par a lograr una resiliencia sistémica, es importante abordar los riesgos y desafíos causados por el nexo de 
la seguridad climática.  
 
¿Cuál es el problema?  
• La falta de evidencia científica precisa que describa cómo, dónde y para quién, el cambio climático, aumenta y 
exacerba las causas de raíz de la inseguridad.  
• Falta de políticas, programas y financiación que aborden conjuntamente la adaptación al cambio climático y los 
retos de seguridad.  
 
¿Qué se quiere entender?  
• ¿Cómo agrava el cambio climático las causas raíz de la inseguridad humana y las tensiones? El nexo.  
• ¿Dónde están las zonas más vulnerables a los riesgos de seguridad climática?  
• ¿Quiénes son los grupos más vulnerables a los riesgos de seguridad climática?

Áreas de Acción:  
• Evidencia para la Paz:  Proporcionar una evidencia científica sólida sobre las conexiones entre el cambio 
climático y seguridad para una mejor toma de decisiones.  
• Programación para la Paz : Co-diseñar programas y proyectos que tengan en consideración en nexo entre 
cambio climático y seguridad.  
• Políticas para la Paz : Co-diseñar  y actualizar políticas nacionales y regionales para que reconozcan y aborden 
los riesgos de seguridad climática.  
• Financiación para la Paz : Co-diseñar y priorizar inversiones que aborden los riesgos de seguridad climática.  
• Áreas temáticas: Movilidad humana (desplazamiento, migración voluntaria, etc.)  
 
La violencia, la inseguridad alimentaria y los impactos del cambio climático están relacionados de diferentes formas y 
son motores de la movilidad humana. Los sistemas agroalimentarios juegan un papel esencial en el nexo.  
 
Es necesario construir más evidencia que ponga las voces de las comunidades en el centro, que pueda ser útil para los 
tomadores de decisiones y que ayude a comprender mejor:  
• Los tiempos y las razones de la decisión de migrar y como estos varían por grupo de población, región y tipo 
de migración.  
• Comprender las vulnerabilidades tanto de las personas migrantes como de las comunidades de acogida para 
construir resiliencia y cohesión social.  
• Los retos y las oportunidades de adaptación de las comunidades en origen, especialmente para aquellas 
personas atrapadas en situación de vulnerabilidad.  
 
Hace dos meses CGIAR ha lanzado una nueva iniciativa llamada; fragilidad, conflicto y migración (FCM 2023 -2025); 
como parte de esta iniciativa, hace un mes fue publicado un paper sobre cambio climático, seguridad y migración en 
Centro América que lanza los  siguientes datos:  
• La migración intrarregional en CA suele ser mayoritariamente hacia Panamá, Belice y Costa Rica, 
comparativamente menos afectados por la violencia y el cambio climático.  
• Las remesas son clave para la inversión en la adaptación de las actividades agrícolas, permitiendo su mejora y 
continuidad.  
• Ante la ausencia de estrategias de adaptación en el origen, la migración es optada como mecanismo para hacer 
frente a los impactos climáticos (migración como adaptación).  
 
La migración también plantea retos:  
• Las remesas en ocasiones han estado ligadas al aumento de la demanda de tierra agrícola, pudiendo contribuir 
a la deforestación.  
• El acceso desigual a las remesas puede generar problemas en las comunidades.  
• La migración rural -urbana supone un reto para acomodar las demandas de una población creciente y la 
violencia existente dificulta la capacidad de adaptación.  
Page 19:
 19 • La llegada de jóvenes a las ciudades supone un reto en un contexto en el que la falta de oportunidades y la 
marginalización son aprovechadas por las pandillas para aumentar sus filas.  
 
No se puede analizar la migración de forma aislada sin considerar factores socioeconómicos, políticos y 
medioambientales.  
 
Para aportar a la investigación CGIAR ha creado una serie de herramientas. La principal herramienta es el Observatorio 
de Seguridad Climática que es una plataforma de fácil acceso que reúne información como la del análisis espacial que 
identifica, el dónde. También se realiza un análisis de coherencia de políticas para entender cómo Guatemala y la región 
abordan la seguridad climática. Dentro de los principales resultados están:  
 
• Escaso reconocimiento del nexo de seguridad climática.  
• Pocas referencias al impacto desigual del cambio climático que afecta desproporcionadamente a las 
comunidades indígenas, las mujeres y las comunidades desplazadas.  
• Falta de integración multisectorial en instrumentos específicos de políticas.  
• Mayor consideración del nexo de seguridad climática a nivel regional.  Ej. Estrategia Regional de Cambio 
Climático del SICA.  
 
En Guatemala se ha desarrollado una estrategia de visión compartida sobre Seguridad Climática para establecer cómo 
es Guatemala y como se concibe este nexo e identificar retos, oportunidades y desarrollar el plan de acción.  
 
Dentro de los retos están:  
• El desarrollo de más evidencia científica enfocada en Guatemala, incluyendo dimensiones de género,  así como 
el papel que juega la movilidad humana en e","8361"

During this 10-day event, various topics were be explored such as in situ conservation, farmers' rights, the value chain and landscape-level experiences.

The learning objective was to provide a practical insight into how these innovations work and how they can be applied for agrobiodiversity conservation. Through concrete examples and experiences in different contexts, we sought to showcase practical innovation that can be replicated in other places to participants from the Initiative’s countries of intervention (Colombia, Vietnam).  We sought to stimulate the exchange of experiences between a wide range of actors, such as farmers, civil society and public institutions. The aim was to create a space for dialogue and learning where successful experiences and challenges encountered iare shared. This will inspire “change agents” to replicate key components.  ","361"

2 IRC Climate Resiliency – Anticipatory Action Pilot•Program : To reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies  and support  
households  to build  resilience  against  climate  shocks  by providing  climate  risk 
reduction  payments  and early  warning  messaging  to smallholder  farmers .
•Research : To assess  the effectiveness  of use of early  warning  systems  and 
anticipatory  cash  transfers  versus  post-shock  cash  transfers  to mitigate  the 
level of shock  and stress  experienced  by small  holder  farmers  in the event  of a 
hazardous  climatic  event
•Outcome : Households  reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies,  improve  
food security  and income  and build  resilience  to climatic  shocks .Project Goals

Hypothesis, experiment and study area
Hypothesis
When  climate  vulnerable  communities  have  timely  access  to information  and the financial  
and social  resources  to act upon  that information,  they will avoid  negative  coping  strategies,  
build  more  diversified  and climate  resilient  livelihoods .
Experiment
•Provision  of information  – early  warning  messages  (flood  alert,  disaster  risk/emergency  
preparedness,  disaster  management  and CSA)
•Transfer  of a lump  sum cash  (₦195,000 (~400USD)  to 725 flood -prone  HHs when  triggered  
by the climate  data risk thresholds,  and same  No. HHs (‘control  group’)  received  equal  
amount  of cash  post shock .
Study  area
•Fufore  LGA,  Adamawa

Key outcomes
Outcome1: 
Increase in climate 
adaptive actions 
Page 6:
Key results and implications
•Pre-shock  cash  payment  had significant  impacts  on:
•Household’s  rCSI and LCSI . HH less likely  to employ  negative  coping  strategies  in 
response  to the flood  shocks
•Labor  re-allocation  decisions  including  migration  of household  members . Generate  
additional  income  to meet  household  needs .
•Number  of pre-emptive  actions  households  took in anticipation  of flood  shocks .
•Long-term investment  decisions  on productive  agric . assets  and productive  livestock . 
This could  enhance  HH’s  future  income  generating  capacity  and reduce  their 
vulnerability  to future  shocks . Hence,  support  long-term resilience .
•No significant  difference  between  anticipatory  & post-shock  cash recipient  households  on 
FCS,  crop diversification,  mixed  crop-livestock  production,  and post-shock  actions  taken . 
Page 7:
Recommendations
•Given  the generally  positive  findings  on climate  resilience  capacity  and investment,  we 
suggest   humanitarian  agencies  and governments  to consider  anticipatory  interventions  
(such  as pre-shock  cash  transfers)  as a mechanism  for both meeting  basic  needs  (i.e., 
food consumption)  and improving  climate  resilience  of households . 
•As climate  shocks  continue  to worsen  and humanitarian  funding  needs  remain  unmet,  
anticipatory  interventions  may be critical  to meeting  the needs  of climate - and conflict -
affected  households .

2
•Conflict  remains  a major  driver  of poverty  in Africa   and conflicts  and political  
instabilities  have been increasing . 
•Explore  the relationship  between  violent  conflicts ; and farmers’  crop land; the share  of 
area planted  and harvested . 
•Implications  of conflict  on household’s  crop choices  and land allocation  decisions . 
•Explore  whether  conflict  shocks  influence  a shift from  high-investment  activities  to 
subsistence  activities .
•The relationship  between  violent  conflicts  and access  to community  services
Page 11:
www.cgiar.orgThe Data
•Geocoded  longitudinal  dataset  based  on an agricultural  survey  administered  in 
Nigeria  across  the three -wave  LSMS -ISA panel  survey . 
•Measured  conflicts  exposure  using  the number  of fatalities  associated  with incidents .
•Farmer’s  land allocation  was measured  using  the share  of area planted  in major  
crops  to total land area cultivated
•Based  on this measure,  we estimate  the effect  of violent  conflicts  on several  crop 
choice  and sales decisions . 
    
Page 12:
www.cgiar.orgKey Descriptive Findings
•Most  of the households  (70%) were  into cereals  production,  38% produced  legumes,  38% 
produced  roots,  while  very few (7%) produced  trees. 
•High  conflict  states : lower  percentage  of hired  labor  and lower  percentage  of purchase  of 
agricultural  inputs
•Land  area planted  with cereals  was higher  in high than in the low conflict  states .
•Area  covered  by roots  and trees is higher  in low than in high conflict  states . 
•HHs in low conflict  states  are more  likely  to engage  in wage  employment  & higher  market  
flexibility . 
Page 13:
www.cgiar.orgKey Empirical Findings
•Conflicts  reduced  land area dedicated  to longer -term crops  but increase  the share  of land 
area dedicated  to short -term crops  such as cereals . 
•Conflicts  reduced  the shares  of land area covered  with crops . Prolonged  conflict  may 
push HHs to exploit  a lower  % of their land for productive  activities
•Significantly  reduce  the shares  of agricultural  land harvested . 
•Conflicts  has a negative  significant  effect  on farmers  access  to market  and cooperatives .
•Negative  direct  effect  on investment  (area  planted,  area harvested)  and indirect  
(destruction  and disruption  of community  services)  
Page 14:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions
Violent conflicts affect land 
allocation patterns and cropping 
patterns, reducing land area 
allocated to longer -term crops 
such as trees and legumes that 
are amenable to longer -term soil 
management practices. 
Violent conflicts reduce market 
participation and hence induces 
production -oriented to satisfy 
own consumption.

Evaluation Questions
1.What is the productivity change gain for PBR cowpea compared to a conventional 
variety?
2.What is the effect of PBR cowpea on insecticide applications?
3.Does reduction in pesticide application translate to better health indicators for farmers 
and their families? 
4.Does the cultivation of PBR cowpea change household consumption of cowpea and/or 
increase cowpea surpluses? 
5.What are the heterogeneous impacts of PBR cowpea adoption by gender, age, and 
other household characteristics?

What is WEAGov ?
-WEAGov  – the Women’s Empowerment in Agrifood Governance 
tool – is an assessment framework to measure women’s voice in 
the agrifood policy process
-Developed by International Food Policy Research Institute 
(IFPRI) researchers and piloted in Nigeria by APRNet
-How can WEAGov  be used?
1.Measure women’s voice across different parts of the policy 
process
2.Identify entry points for raising women’s voice in different 
parts of the policy process
3.Track progress in women’s empowerment in agrifood policy 
process over time
Page 24:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
Page 25:

Page 26:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
-Gender equality within agrifood systems is essential to meeting 
SDGs, yet it is difficult to measure and track
-There is a need to identify specific windows and opportunities to 
raise women’s voice in the agrifood policy process in order to 
achieve meaningful progress
Page 27:
WEAGov  covers 3 stages of the policy 
process
Agenda setting, 
Policy design, and 
Policy adoption 
Policy

and Policy adoption : 
•Why certain social and

5 key measurement steps
▪Agrifood policy & stakeholder mapping → policy content analysis on gender 
integration and analysis of organizations involved in agrifood policy process
▪Desk review of objective, quantitative indicators of women’s empowerment in 
agrifood governance 
-e.g., # women ministers of agrifood agencies
▪Organization survey 
-Quantitative, objective data on staffing, gender strategies, gender activities of agrifood 
organizations
-Survey given to organizations involved in agrifood policy process – public sector (federal 
and state), private sector, and civil society organizations 
▪Expert survey 
-Perceptions and beliefs of key in -country stakeholders in the sector
-e.g., are opportunities for women’s participation well -known and utilized by key civil 
society actors  
-Survey given to leaders and experts in organizations in the agrifood policy process 
▪Technical panels or focus group discussions  
-Deliberate on measurement and validity with country experts

www.cgiar.orgIntroduction
•Government policies affect everyone, yet 
women are underrepresented in policymaking 
(Duflo 2012; Lawless 2015)
•Women’s participation in politics and civic life 
remains comparatively low (Iversen and 
Rosenbluth 2006)
•Reasons may include a lack of relevant skills and 
training, or norms that proscribe such behavior
•Worrisome as:
•Women’s unique policy needs may not be met if they lack voice and agency
•Women’s voice and agency in their community also help support women’s livelihoods

The Role of Spatial Inequalities on Youth Migration 
Decisions: Empirical Evidence from Nigeria
Mulubrhan Amare 
(with Kibrom A. Abay and Jordan Chamberlin )
Page 47:
www.cgiar.orgMotivation 
•The spatial  flow of labor  within  countries  responds  and contributes  to the geographical  
distribution  of economic  activity  and opportunity .
•Understanding  migration  decisions,  destination  and duration  helps  inform  our 
understanding  of the potential  outcomes  of alternative  regional  development  strategies . 
•How  different  types  of migrants  respond  to differences  in amenities,  resources,  and 
economic  activity,  to design  effective  policies  for migration,  
•Destination  perspective  to understanding  potential  pull factors  for various  forms  of 
migration
•Examine  how the attributes  of potential  destinations,  both in absolute  terms  as well as 
relative  to origins  of migration .
Page 48:
www.cgiar.orgObjectives
▪W e study youth migrants’ responses to observable characteristics of potential destinations 
and how these responses vary across various forms of migration.
▪Examine the role of observable attributes of potential destinations, both in absolute terms as 
well as relative to origin of migration.
▪Explore potential heterogeneity in the impacts of observable characteristics of potential 
destinations across various types of migrants. 
▪Understand pull factors of youth migration, a country characterized by relatively high rates 
of internal youth migration
▪Dyadic comparison of destinations and origins underscores the analytical importance of 
relative distributions of endowments.

•There are 3,140 youth migrants to each state. 
•Each of the migrants has chosen to move to one potential destination; and has therefore 
chosen not to move to the 36 remaining destinations. 
•Interested in explaining why each individual migrated to each actual destination and not to 
the remaining 36 states.

Destination choice of migrants by destination characteristics 
Page 51:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions and Implications 
•Migrants  respond  differently  to observable  characteristics  depending  on migration  pattern,  
duration,  and socioeconomic  status .
•Migrants  prefer  destinations  with higher  relative  welfare  and lower  cost of living .
•Rural -rural  migrants  are responsive  to agricultural  productivity  and land availability .
•Rural -urban  and urban -urban  youth  migrants  focus  on welfare  and urban  intensity .
•Permanent  migrants  prioritize  cost of living  but non-poor migrants  prioritize  welfare
•Policy  makers  can encourage  rural -rural  migration  by improving  agricultural  production  
potential  to reduce  youth  unemployment  and social  tensions  in urban  areas .

Experiments to accelerate 
adoption of improved 
varieties and quality seeds

Page 53:
What drives farmers, consumers and private sector decisions to 
adopt new varieties and related products?
The problem: New varieties (even if the best ones) are 
often not adopted because of behavioral barriers and 
processes. Examples:
•Benefits from drought -tolerant varieties only 
experienced when there is a drought
•Improved nutritional value: Difficult to observe
With these barriers, how to accelerate varietal 
turnover?
Limited or unpredictable demand will limit private sector 
interest in promoting new varieties and related products.
•How to get private sector to promote new products?
Page 54:
Research Question 1 – How can we accelerate varietal turnover?Main Investment: A behavioral multi -country multi -crop randomized trial
•Six experiments (5 countries) 
•Coordinated experimental designs – common interventions
•Quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, and the same outcome variables.
•Nigeria: Baseline survey completed and seed trial minipack distribution started 
Sites and crops: 
•Nigeria: cowpea, maize
•Ethiopia: teff and wheat
•India: green gram, groundnut, rice
•Kenya: maize, beans, cowpea, green 
gram, sorghum
•Uganda: maize, sweet potato (2 sites)
Page 55:
Study site: Bauchi and Kaduna states, Nigeria 
Sample size: 2,016 households in 252 villages surveyed at baseline
Constraints to adoption of newer 
varieties: 
•Lack of information about new 
varieties
•Farmers are cautious to try out new 
varieties
•Lack of access to improved seeds
•Poor management practices
•Gender -based constraints
❖Women have low access to information, 
improved seeds, inputs, mobility
❖Women lack decision -making in varietal

•Assess the associations between the quantity of  certified 
seeds produced and the spatial variations from where they 
are produced and,
•Spatial variations in the use of  certified seeds and/or 
improved varieties, yields, and output, and their relationship 
with agroclimatic and socioeconomic conditions

www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
4•Yield responses from certified seeds vary depending on the nature of  the farmland 
•When certified seeds are available, both yield and use increase. When it hits its peak, 
the effect of  the increase begins to diminish. 
•There are variations in the yields from certified seed which could be a result of  
climatic conditions and farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics.
•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
Page 64:
www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
5•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
•Farmers in close proximity to certified seed use it and improve their yields and 
outputs. This effect diminishes at the margin due to two factors
1.Yields from certified seeds vary considerably within each state, suggesting either 
quality issues in the supply chain or farmers not using complementary inputs or 
management practices when using quality seed.
2.As certified seed becomes more available to farmers, its use may spread from 
higher -return farms to lower -return farms, thereby diminishing the gains on the 
extensive margin.
Page 65:
www.cgiar.orgPolicy recommendations 
6•Revisit seed certification target in Nigeria
•Prioritize spatially the seed certification expansion effort if  it 
is still of  policy importance
•Promote more decentralized systems, like QDS / community 
seed schemes for rice, cowpeas, and OPV maize (as in various 
Eastern and Southern African countries)

Page 67:
Introduction to SAM
➢SAM  is a systematic  tool for economy -wide  analysis  and policy  prioritization,  used  to 
prioritize  the most  appropriate  investments  and suitable  policies  that can transform  the 
Nigerian  agricultural  food  market  and system .
➢SAM  is a national  accounting  framework  that captures  the circular  flow  of receipts  and 
payments  between  agents  and markets . 
➢SAM  provides  a complete  and consistent  dataset  of all economic  transactions  that takes  
place  within  the socio -economic  system .
➢Some  of the data  source  include : National  accounts  (NBS),  government  financial  statistics  
(Ministry  of Finance,  CBN),  Balance  of Payment  (IMF)  Household  expenditures,  and Labour  
Force  Surveys  etc.
Page 68:
Basic Structure of SAM
➢It sheds  light  on the activities  of the different  
economic  agents  by describing  the 
interrelationship  between  firms,  farms,  
households,  investors  and the external  sector .
➢The flow  of economic  activities  in monetary  terms  
from  expenditure/outflow  (col)  to income/inflow  
(row)
➢Activities  are domestic  firms  that  produce  goods  
and services  (commodities) . Factors  (labour , 
capital  and land)  are important  to produce  
activities . The activities  pay owners/suppliers  of 
factors  (households  – wages  and rents),  
government  (profits,  direct  tax),  and the rest of 
the world  (import,  debt  repayments)

2 IRC Climate Resiliency – Anticipatory Action Pilot•Program : To reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies  and support  
households  to build  resilience  against  climate  shocks  by providing  climate  risk 
reduction  payments  and early  warning  messaging  to smallholder  farmers .
•Research : To assess  the effectiveness  of use of early  warning  systems  and 
anticipatory  cash  transfers  versus  post-shock  cash  transfers  to mitigate  the 
level of shock  and stress  experienced  by small  holder  farmers  in the event  of a 
hazardous  climatic  event
•Outcome : Households  reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies,  improve  
food security  and income  and build  resilience  to climatic  shocks .Project Goals

Hypothesis, experiment and study area
Hypothesis
When  climate  vulnerable  communities  have  timely  access  to information  and the financial  
and social  resources  to act upon  that information,  they will avoid  negative  coping  strategies,  
build  more  diversified  and climate  resilient  livelihoods .
Experiment
•Provision  of information  – early  warning  messages  (flood  alert,  disaster  risk/emergency  
preparedness,  disaster  management  and CSA)
•Transfer  of a lump  sum cash  (₦195,000 (~400USD)  to 725 flood -prone  HHs when  triggered  
by the climate  data risk thresholds,  and same  No. HHs (‘control  group’)  received  equal  
amount  of cash  post shock .
Study  area
•Fufore  LGA,  Adamawa

Key outcomes
Outcome1: 
Increase in climate 
adaptive actions 
Page 6:
Key results and implications
•Pre-shock  cash  payment  had significant  impacts  on:
•Household’s  rCSI and LCSI . HH less likely  to employ  negative  coping  strategies  in 
response  to the flood  shocks
•Labor  re-allocation  decisions  including  migration  of household  members . Generate  
additional  income  to meet  household  needs .
•Number  of pre-emptive  actions  households  took in anticipation  of flood  shocks .
•Long-term investment  decisions  on productive  agric . assets  and productive  livestock . 
This could  enhance  HH’s  future  income  generating  capacity  and reduce  their 
vulnerability  to future  shocks . Hence,  support  long-term resilience .
•No significant  difference  between  anticipatory  & post-shock  cash recipient  households  on 
FCS,  crop diversification,  mixed  crop-livestock  production,  and post-shock  actions  taken . 
Page 7:
Recommendations
•Given  the generally  positive  findings  on climate  resilience  capacity  and investment,  we 
suggest   humanitarian  agencies  and governments  to consider  anticipatory  interventions  
(such  as pre-shock  cash  transfers)  as a mechanism  for both meeting  basic  needs  (i.e., 
food consumption)  and improving  climate  resilience  of households . 
•As climate  shocks  continue  to worsen  and humanitarian  funding  needs  remain  unmet,  
anticipatory  interventions  may be critical  to meeting  the needs  of climate - and conflict -
affected  households .

Violent Conflicts, Land Allocation, and Related 
Agricultural Investments: Empirical Evidence from 
Nigeria.

www.cgiar.orgObjectives
2
•Conflict  remains  a major  driver  of poverty  in Africa   and conflicts  and political  
instabilities  have been increasing . 
•Explore  the relationship  between  violent  conflicts ; and farmers’  crop land; the share  of 
area planted  and harvested . 
•Implications  of conflict  on household’s  crop choices  and land allocation  decisions . 
•Explore  whether  conflict  shocks  influence  a shift from  high-investment  activities  to 
subsistence  activities .
•The relationship  between  violent  conflicts  and access  to community  services
Page 11:
www.cgiar.orgThe Data
•Geocoded  longitudinal  dataset  based  on an agricultural  survey  administered  in 
Nigeria  across  the three -wave  LSMS -ISA panel  survey . 
•Measured  conflicts  exposure  using  the number  of fatalities  associated  with incidents .
•Farmer’s  land allocation  was measured  using  the share  of area planted  in major  
crops  to total land area cultivated
•Based  on this measure,  we estimate  the effect  of violent  conflicts  on several  crop 
choice  and sales decisions . 
    
Page 12:
www.cgiar.orgKey Descriptive Findings
•Most  of the households  (70%) were  into cereals  production,  38% produced  legumes,  38% 
produced  roots,  while  very few (7%) produced  trees. 
•High  conflict  states : lower  percentage  of hired  labor  and lower  percentage  of purchase  of 
agricultural  inputs
•Land  area planted  with cereals  was higher  in high than in the low conflict  states .
•Area  covered  by roots  and trees is higher  in low than in high conflict  states . 
•HHs in low conflict  states  are more  likely  to engage  in wage  employment  & higher  market  
flexibility . 
Page 13:
www.cgiar.orgKey Empirical Findings
•Conflicts  reduced  land area dedicated  to longer -term crops  but increase  the share  of land 
area dedicated  to short -term crops  such as cereals . 
•Conflicts  reduced  the shares  of land area covered  with crops . Prolonged  conflict  may 
push HHs to exploit  a lower  % of their land for productive  activities
•Significantly  reduce  the shares  of agricultural  land harvested . 
•Conflicts  has a negative  significant  effect  on farmers  access  to market  and cooperatives .
•Negative  direct  effect  on investment  (area  planted,  area harvested)  and indirect  
(destruction  and disruption  of community  services)  
Page 14:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions
Violent conflicts affect land 
allocation patterns and cropping 
patterns, reducing land area 
allocated to longer -term crops 
such as trees and legumes that 
are amenable to longer -term soil 
management practices. 
Violent conflicts reduce market 
participation and hence induces 
production -oriented to satisfy 
own consumption.

Evaluation Questions
1.What is the productivity change gain for PBR cowpea compared to a conventional 
variety?
2.What is the effect of PBR cowpea on insecticide applications?
3.Does reduction in pesticide application translate to better health indicators for farmers 
and their families? 
4.Does the cultivation of PBR cowpea change household consumption of cowpea and/or 
increase cowpea surpluses? 
5.What are the heterogeneous impacts of PBR cowpea adoption by gender, age, and 
other household characteristics?

What is WEAGov ?
-WEAGov  – the Women’s Empowerment in Agrifood Governance 
tool – is an assessment framework to measure women’s voice in 
the agrifood policy process
-Developed by International Food Policy Research Institute 
(IFPRI) researchers and piloted in Nigeria by APRNet
-How can WEAGov  be used?
1.Measure women’s voice across different parts of the policy 
process
2.Identify entry points for raising women’s voice in different 
parts of the policy process
3.Track progress in women’s empowerment in agrifood policy 
process over time
Page 24:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
Page 25:

Women make up only 22%  of 
members of parliament 
worldwide…
… and only 16%  of 
cabinet secretaries
Page 26:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
-Gender equality within agrifood systems is essential to meeting 
SDGs, yet it is difficult to measure and track
-There is a need to identify specific windows and opportunities to 
raise women’s voice in the agrifood policy process in order to 
achieve meaningful progress
Page 27:
WEAGov  covers 3 stages of the policy 
process
Agenda setting, 
Policy design, and 
Policy adoption 
Policy

reformAgenda setting, Policy design, 
and Policy adoption : 
•Why certain social and 
economic problems emerge

•Which policy solutions are 
ultimately adopted
Policy implementation
•How policies are implemented 
in practice, including 
budgetary outlays, 
organizational strategies, and 
delivery of servicesPolicy evaluation & reform
•How policies are assessed 
against their objectives to 
know if changes are needed
Page 28:

How is WEAGov data collected? 
5 key measurement steps
▪Agrifood policy & stakeholder mapping → policy content analysis on gender 
integration and analysis of organizations involved in agrifood policy process
▪Desk review of objective, quantitative indicators of women’s empowerment in 
agrifood governance 
-e.g., # women ministers of agrifood agencies
▪Organization survey 
-Quantitative, objective data on staffing, gender strategies, gender activities of agrifood 
organizations
-Survey given to organizations involved in agrifood policy process – public sector (federal 
and state), private sector, and civil society organizations 
▪Expert survey 
-Perceptions and beliefs of key in -country stakeholders in the sector
-e.g., are opportunities for women’s participation well -known and utilized by key civil 
society actors  
-Survey given to leaders and experts in organizations in the agrifood policy process 
▪Technical panels or focus group discussions  
-Deliberate on measurement and validity with country experts

www.cgiar.orgIntroduction
•Government policies affect everyone, yet 
women are underrepresented in policymaking 
(Duflo 2012; Lawless 2015)
•Women’s participation in politics and civic life 
remains comparatively low (Iversen and 
Rosenbluth 2006)
•Reasons may include a lack of relevant skills and 
training, or norms that proscribe such behavior
•Worrisome as:
•Women’s unique policy needs may not be met if they lack voice and agency
•Women’s voice and agency in their community also help support women’s livelihoods

▪W e study youth migrants’ responses to observable characteristics of potential destinations 
and how these responses vary across various forms of migration.
▪Examine the role of observable attributes of potential destinations, both in absolute terms as 
well as relative to origin of migration.
▪Explore potential heterogeneity in the impacts of observable characteristics of potential 
destinations across various types of migrants. 
▪Understand pull factors of youth migration, a country characterized by relatively high rates 
of internal youth migration
▪Dyadic comparison of destinations and origins underscores the analytical importance of 
relative distributions of endowments.

What drives farmers, consumers and private sector decisions to 
adopt new varieties and related products?
The problem: New varieties (even if the best ones) are 
often not adopted because of behavioral barriers and 
processes. Examples:
•Benefits from drought -tolerant varieties only 
experienced when there is a drought
•Improved nutritional value: Difficult to observe
With these barriers, how to accelerate varietal 
turnover?
Limited or unpredictable demand will limit private sector 
interest in promoting new varieties and related products.
•How to get private sector to promote new products?
Page 54:
Research Question 1 – How can we accelerate varietal turnover?Main Investment: A behavioral multi -country multi -crop randomized trial
•Six experiments (5 countries) 
•Coordinated experimental designs – common interventions
•Quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, and the same outcome variables.
•Nigeria: Baseline survey completed and seed trial minipack distribution started 
Sites and crops: 
•Nigeria: cowpea, maize
•Ethiopia: teff and wheat
•India: green gram, groundnut, rice
•Kenya: maize, beans, cowpea, green 
gram, sorghum
•Uganda: maize, sweet potato (2 sites)
Page 55:
Study site: Bauchi and Kaduna states, Nigeria 
Sample size: 2,016 households in 252 villages surveyed at baseline
Constraints to adoption of newer 
varieties: 
•Lack of information about new 
varieties
•Farmers are cautious to try out new 
varieties
•Lack of access to improved seeds
•Poor management practices
•Gender -based constraints
❖Women have low access to information, 
improved seeds, inputs, mobility
❖Women lack decision -making in varietal

1•This study explores the value of  quality assurance systems 
with an analysis of  certified seed production and 
distribution in Nigeria.
•Assess the associations between the quantity of  certified 
seeds produced and the spatial variations from where they 
are produced and,
•Spatial variations in the use of  certified seeds and/or 
improved varieties, yields, and output, and their relationship 
with agroclimatic and socioeconomic conditions

www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
4•Yield responses from certified seeds vary depending on the nature of  the farmland 
•When certified seeds are available, both yield and use increase. When it hits its peak, 
the effect of  the increase begins to diminish. 
•There are variations in the yields from certified seed which could be a result of  
climatic conditions and farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics.
•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
Page 64:
www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
5•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
•Farmers in close proximity to certified seed use it and improve their yields and 
outputs. This effect diminishes at the margin due to two factors
1.Yields from certified seeds vary considerably within each state, suggesting either 
quality issues in the supply chain or farmers not using complementary inputs or 
management practices when using quality seed.
2.As certified seed becomes more available to farmers, its use may spread from 
higher -return farms to lower -return farms, thereby diminishing the gains on the 
extensive margin.
Page 65:
www.cgiar.orgPolicy recommendations 
6•Revisit seed certification target in Nigeria
•Prioritize spatially the seed certification expansion effort if  it 
is still of  policy importance
•Promote more decentralized systems, like QDS / community 
seed schemes for rice, cowpeas, and OPV maize (as in various 
Eastern and Southern African countries)

Introduction to SAM
➢SAM  is a systematic  tool for economy -wide  analysis  and policy  prioritization,  used  to 
prioritize  the most  appropriate  investments  and suitable  policies  that can transform  the 
Nigerian  agricultural  food  market  and system .
➢SAM  is a national  accounting  framework  that captures  the circular  flow  of receipts  and 
payments  between  agents  and markets . 
➢SAM  provides  a complete  and consistent  dataset  of all economic  transactions  that takes  
place  within  the socio -economic  system .
➢Some  of the data  source  include : National  accounts  (NBS),  government  financial  statistics  
(Ministry  of Finance,  CBN),  Balance  of Payment  (IMF)  Household  expenditures,  and Labour  
Force  Surveys  etc.
Page 68:
Basic Structure of SAM
➢It sheds  light  on the activities  of the different  
economic  agents  by describing  the 
interrelationship  between  firms,  farms,  
households,  investors  and the external  sector .
➢The flow  of economic  activities  in monetary  terms  
from  expenditure/outflow  (col)  to income/inflow  
(row)
➢Activities  are domestic  firms  that  produce  goods  
and services  (commodities) . Factors  (labour , 
capital  and land)  are important  to produce  
activities . The activities  pay owners/suppliers  of 
factors  (households  – wages  and rents),  
government  (profits,  direct  tax),  and the rest of 
the world  (import,  debt  repayments)

2 IRC Climate Resiliency – Anticipatory Action Pilot•Program : To reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies  and support  
households  to build  resilience  against  climate  shocks  by providing  climate  risk 
reduction  payments  and early  warning  messaging  to smallholder  farmers .
•Research : To assess  the effectiveness  of use of early  warning  systems  and 
anticipatory  cash  transfers  versus  post-shock  cash  transfers  to mitigate  the 
level of shock  and stress  experienced  by small  holder  farmers  in the event  of a 
hazardous  climatic  event
•Outcome : Households  reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies,  improve  
food security  and income  and build  resilience  to climatic  shocks .Project Goals
Page 4:
Hypothesis, experiment and study area
Hypothesis
When  climate  vulnerable  communities  have  timely  access  to information  and the financial  
and social  resources  to act upon  that information,  they will avoid  negative  coping  strategies,  
build  more  diversified  and climate  resilient  livelihoods .
Experiment
•Provision  of information  – early  warning  messages  (flood  alert,  disaster  risk/emergency  
preparedness,  disaster  management  and CSA)
•Transfer  of a lump  sum cash  (₦195,000 (~400USD)  to 725 flood -prone  HHs when  triggered  
by the climate  data risk thresholds,  and same  No. HHs (‘control  group’)  received  equal  
amount  of cash  post shock .

Page 6:
Key results and implications
•Pre-shock  cash  payment  had significant  impacts  on:
•Household’s  rCSI and LCSI . HH less likely  to employ  negative  coping  strategies  in 
response  to the flood  shocks
•Labor  re-allocation  decisions  including  migration  of household  members . Generate  
additional  income  to meet  household  needs .
•Number  of pre-emptive  actions  households  took in anticipation  of flood  shocks .
•Long-term investment  decisions  on productive  agric . assets  and productive  livestock . 
This could  enhance  HH’s  future  income  generating  capacity  and reduce  their 
vulnerability  to future  shocks . Hence,  support  long-term resilience .
•No significant  difference  between  anticipatory  & post-shock  cash recipient  households  on 
FCS,  crop diversification,  mixed  crop-livestock  production,  and post-shock  actions  taken . 
Page 7:
Recommendations
•Given  the generally  positive  findings  on climate  resilience  capacity  and investment,  we 
suggest   humanitarian  agencies  and governments  to consider  anticipatory  interventions  
(such  as pre-shock  cash  transfers)  as a mechanism  for both meeting  basic  needs  (i.e., 
food consumption)  and improving  climate  resilience  of households . 
•As climate  shocks  continue  to worsen  and humanitarian  funding  needs  remain  unmet,  
anticipatory  interventions  may be critical  to meeting  the needs  of climate - and conflict -
affected  households .

2
•Conflict  remains  a major  driver  of poverty  in Africa   and conflicts  and political  
instabilities  have been increasing . 
•Explore  the relationship  between  violent  conflicts ; and farmers’  crop land; the share  of 
area planted  and harvested . 
•Implications  of conflict  on household’s  crop choices  and land allocation  decisions . 
•Explore  whether  conflict  shocks  influence  a shift from  high-investment  activities  to 
subsistence  activities .
•The relationship  between  violent  conflicts  and access  to community  services
Page 11:
www.cgiar.orgThe Data
•Geocoded  longitudinal  dataset  based  on an agricultural  survey  administered  in 
Nigeria  across  the three -wave  LSMS -ISA panel  survey . 
•Measured  conflicts  exposure  using  the number  of fatalities  associated  with incidents .
•Farmer’s  land allocation  was measured  using  the share  of area planted  in major  
crops  to total land area cultivated
•Based  on this measure,  we estimate  the effect  of violent  conflicts  on several  crop 
choice  and sales decisions . 
    
Page 12:
www.cgiar.orgKey Descriptive Findings
•Most  of the households  (70%) were  into cereals  production,  38% produced  legumes,  38% 
produced  roots,  while  very few (7%) produced  trees. 
•High  conflict  states : lower  percentage  of hired  labor  and lower  percentage  of purchase  of 
agricultural  inputs
•Land  area planted  with cereals  was higher  in high than in the low conflict  states .
•Area  covered  by roots  and trees is higher  in low than in high conflict  states . 
•HHs in low conflict  states  are more  likely  to engage  in wage  employment  & higher  market  
flexibility . 
Page 13:
www.cgiar.orgKey Empirical Findings
•Conflicts  reduced  land area dedicated  to longer -term crops  but increase  the share  of land 
area dedicated  to short -term crops  such as cereals . 
•Conflicts  reduced  the shares  of land area covered  with crops . Prolonged  conflict  may 
push HHs to exploit  a lower  % of their land for productive  activities
•Significantly  reduce  the shares  of agricultural  land harvested . 
•Conflicts  has a negative  significant  effect  on farmers  access  to market  and cooperatives .
•Negative  direct  effect  on investment  (area  planted,  area harvested)  and indirect  
(destruction  and disruption  of community  services)  
Page 14:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions
Violent conflicts affect land 
allocation patterns and cropping

allocated to longer -term crops 
such as trees and legumes that 
are amenable to longer -term soil 
management practices. 
Violent conflicts reduce market 
participation and hence induces 
production -oriented to satisfy 
own consumption.

Evaluation Questions
1.What is the productivity change gain for PBR cowpea compared to a conventional 
variety?
2.What is the effect of PBR cowpea on insecticide applications?
3.Does reduction in pesticide application translate to better health indicators for farmers 
and their families? 
4.Does the cultivation of PBR cowpea change household consumption of cowpea and/or 
increase cowpea surpluses? 
5.What are the heterogeneous impacts of PBR cowpea adoption by gender, age, and 
other household characteristics?

What is WEAGov ?
-WEAGov  – the Women’s Empowerment in Agrifood Governance 
tool – is an assessment framework to measure women’s voice in 
the agrifood policy process
-Developed by International Food Policy Research Institute 
(IFPRI) researchers and piloted in Nigeria by APRNet
-How can WEAGov  be used?
1.Measure women’s voice across different parts of the policy 
process
2.Identify entry points for raising women’s voice in different 
parts of the policy process
3.Track progress in women’s empowerment in agrifood policy 
process over time
Page 24:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women

Page 26:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
-Gender equality within agrifood systems is essential to meeting 
SDGs, yet it is difficult to measure and track
-There is a need to identify specific windows and opportunities to 
raise women’s voice in the agrifood policy process in order to 
achieve meaningful progress
Page 27:
WEAGov  covers 3 stages of the policy 
process
Agenda setting, 
Policy design, and 
Policy adoption 
Policy

and Policy adoption : 
•Why certain social and

5 key measurement steps
▪Agrifood policy & stakeholder mapping → policy content analysis on gender 
integration and analysis of organizations involved in agrifood policy process
▪Desk review of objective, quantitative indicators of women’s empowerment in 
agrifood governance 
-e.g., # women ministers of agrifood agencies
▪Organization survey 
-Quantitative, objective data on staffing, gender strategies, gender activities of agrifood 
organizations
-Survey given to organizations involved in agrifood policy process – public sector (federal 
and state), private sector, and civil society organizations 
▪Expert survey 
-Perceptions and beliefs of key in -country stakeholders in the sector
-e.g., are opportunities for women’s participation well -known and utilized by key civil 
society actors  
-Survey given to leaders and experts in organizations in the agrifood policy process 
▪Technical panels or focus group discussions  
-Deliberate on measurement and validity with country experts

www.cgiar.orgIntroduction
•Government policies affect everyone, yet 
women are underrepresented in policymaking 
(Duflo 2012; Lawless 2015)
•Women’s participation in politics and civic life 
remains comparatively low (Iversen and 
Rosenbluth 2006)
•Reasons may include a lack of relevant skills and 
training, or norms that proscribe such behavior
•Worrisome as:
•Women’s unique policy needs may not be met if they lack voice and agency
•Women’s voice and agency in their community also help support women’s livelihoods

The Role of Spatial Inequalities on Youth Migration 
Decisions: Empirical Evidence from Nigeria
Mulubrhan Amare 
(with Kibrom A. Abay and Jordan Chamberlin )
Page 47:
www.cgiar.orgMotivation 
•The spatial  flow of labor  within  countries  responds  and contributes  to the geographical  
distribution  of economic  activity  and opportunity .
•Understanding  migration  decisions,  destination  and duration  helps  inform  our 
understanding  of the potential  outcomes  of alternative  regional  development  strategies . 
•How  different  types  of migrants  respond  to differences  in amenities,  resources,  and 
economic  activity,  to design  effective  policies  for migration,  
•Destination  perspective  to understanding  potential  pull factors  for various  forms  of 
migration
•Examine  how the attributes  of potential  destinations,  both in absolute  terms  as well as 
relative  to origins  of migration .
Page 48:
www.cgiar.orgObjectives
▪W e study youth migrants’ responses to observable characteristics of potential destinations 
and how these responses vary across various forms of migration.
▪Examine the role of observable attributes of potential destinations, both in absolute terms as 
well as relative to origin of migration.
▪Explore potential heterogeneity in the impacts of observable characteristics of potential 
destinations across various types of migrants. 
▪Understand pull factors of youth migration, a country characterized by relatively high rates 
of internal youth migration
▪Dyadic comparison of destinations and origins underscores the analytical importance of 
relative distributions of endowments.

•There are 3,140 youth migrants to each state. 
•Each of the migrants has chosen to move to one potential destination; and has therefore 
chosen not to move to the 36 remaining destinations. 
•Interested in explaining why each individual migrated to each actual destination and not to 
the remaining 36 states.

Destination choice of migrants by destination characteristics 
Page 51:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions and Implications 
•Migrants  respond  differently  to observable  characteristics  depending  on migration  pattern,  
duration,  and socioeconomic  status .
•Migrants  prefer  destinations  with higher  relative  welfare  and lower  cost of living .
•Rural -rural  migrants  are responsive  to agricultural  productivity  and land availability .
•Rural -urban  and urban -urban  youth  migrants  focus  on welfare  and urban  intensity .
•Permanent  migrants  prioritize  cost of living  but non-poor migrants  prioritize  welfare
•Policy  makers  can encourage  rural -rural  migration  by improving  agricultural  production  
potential  to reduce  youth  unemployment  and social  tensions  in urban  areas .

Experiments to accelerate 
adoption of improved 
varieties and quality seeds

Market Intelligence Initiative 
WP3 on Behavioral Intelligence team 
Page 53:
What drives farmers, consumers and private sector decisions to 
adopt new varieties and related products?
The problem: New varieties (even if the best ones) are 
often not adopted because of behavioral barriers and 
processes. Examples:
•Benefits from drought -tolerant varieties only 
experienced when there is a drought
•Improved nutritional value: Difficult to observe
With these barriers, how to accelerate varietal 
turnover?
Limited or unpredictable demand will limit private sector 
interest in promoting new varieties and related products.
•How to get private sector to promote new products?
Page 54:
Research Question 1 – How can we accelerate varietal turnover?Main Investment: A behavioral multi -country multi -crop randomized trial
•Six experiments (5 countries) 
•Coordinated experimental designs – common interventions
•Quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, and the same outcome variables.
•Nigeria: Baseline survey completed and seed trial minipack distribution started 
Sites and crops: 
•Nigeria: cowpea, maize
•Ethiopia: teff and wheat
•India: green gram, groundnut, rice
•Kenya: maize, beans, cowpea, green 
gram, sorghum
•Uganda: maize, sweet potato (2 sites)
Page 55:
Study site: Bauchi and Kaduna states, Nigeria 
Sample size: 2,016 households in 252 villages surveyed at baseline
Constraints to adoption of newer 
varieties: 
•Lack of information about new 
varieties
•Farmers are cautious to try out new 
varieties
•Lack of access to improved seeds
•Poor management practices
•Gender -based constraints
❖Women have low access to information, 
improved seeds, inputs, mobility
❖Women lack decision -making in varietal

•Assess the associations between the quantity of  certified 
seeds produced and the spatial variations from where they 
are produced and,
•Spatial variations in the use of  certified seeds and/or 
improved varieties, yields, and output, and their relationship 
with agroclimatic and socioeconomic conditions

www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
4•Yield responses from certified seeds vary depending on the nature of  the farmland 
•When certified seeds are available, both yield and use increase. When it hits its peak, 
the effect of  the increase begins to diminish. 
•There are variations in the yields from certified seed which could be a result of  
climatic conditions and farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics.
•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
Page 64:
www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
5•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
•Farmers in close proximity to certified seed use it and improve their yields and 
outputs. This effect diminishes at the margin due to two factors
1.Yields from certified seeds vary considerably within each state, suggesting either 
quality issues in the supply chain or farmers not using complementary inputs or 
management practices when using quality seed.
2.As certified seed becomes more available to farmers, its use may spread from 
higher -return farms to lower -return farms, thereby diminishing the gains on the 
extensive margin.
Page 65:
www.cgiar.orgPolicy recommendations 
6•Revisit seed certification target in Nigeria
•Prioritize spatially the seed certification expansion effort if  it 
is still of  policy importance
•Promote more decentralized systems, like QDS / community 
seed schemes for rice, cowpeas, and OPV maize (as in various 
Eastern and Southern African countries)

Page 67:
Introduction to SAM
➢SAM  is a systematic  tool for economy -wide  analysis  and policy  prioritization,  used  to 
prioritize  the most  appropriate  investments  and suitable  policies  that can transform  the 
Nigerian  agricultural  food  market  and system .
➢SAM  is a national  accounting  framework  that captures  the circular  flow  of receipts  and 
payments  between  agents  and markets . 
➢SAM  provides  a complete  and consistent  dataset  of all economic  transactions  that takes  
place  within  the socio -economic  system .
➢Some  of the data  source  include : National  accounts  (NBS),  government  financial  statistics  
(Ministry  of Finance,  CBN),  Balance  of Payment  (IMF)  Household  expenditures,  and Labour  
Force  Surveys  etc.
Page 68:
Basic Structure of SAM
➢It sheds  light  on the activities  of the different  
economic  agents  by describing  the 
interrelationship  between  firms,  farms,  
households,  investors  and the external  sector .
➢The flow  of economic  activities  in monetary  terms  
from  expenditure/outflow  (col)  to income/inflow  
(row)
➢Activities  are domestic  firms  that  produce  goods  
and services  (commodities) . Factors  (labour , 
capital  and land)  are important  to produce  
activities . The activities  pay owners/suppliers  of 
factors  (households  – wages  and rents),  
government  (profits,  direct  tax),  and the rest of 
the world  (import,  debt  repayments)

2 IRC Climate Resiliency – Anticipatory Action Pilot•Program : To reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies  and support  
households  to build  resilience  against  climate  shocks  by providing  climate  risk 
reduction  payments  and early  warning  messaging  to smallholder  farmers .
•Research : To assess  the effectiveness  of use of early  warning  systems  and 
anticipatory  cash  transfers  versus  post-shock  cash  transfers  to mitigate  the 
level of shock  and stress  experienced  by small  holder  farmers  in the event  of a 
hazardous  climatic  event
•Outcome : Households  reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies,  improve  
food security  and income  and build  resilience  to climatic  shocks .Project Goals

Hypothesis, experiment and study area
Hypothesis
When  climate  vulnerable  communities  have  timely  access  to information  and the financial  
and social  resources  to act upon  that information,  they will avoid  negative  coping  strategies,  
build  more  diversified  and climate  resilient  livelihoods .
Experiment
•Provision  of information  – early  warning  messages  (flood  alert,  disaster  risk/emergency  
preparedness,  disaster  management  and CSA)
•Transfer  of a lump  sum cash  (₦195,000 (~400USD)  to 725 flood -prone  HHs when  triggered  
by the climate  data risk thresholds,  and same  No. HHs (‘control  group’)  received  equal  
amount  of cash  post shock .
Study  area
•Fufore  LGA,  Adamawa
Page 5:
Key outcomes
Outcome1: 
Increase in climate 
adaptive actions 
Page 6:
Key results and implications
•Pre-shock  cash  payment  had significant  impacts  on:
•Household’s  rCSI and LCSI . HH less likely  to employ  negative  coping  strategies  in 
response  to the flood  shocks
•Labor  re-allocation  decisions  including  migration  of household  members . Generate  
additional  income  to meet  household  needs .
•Number  of pre-emptive  actions  households  took in anticipation  of flood  shocks .
•Long-term investment  decisions  on productive  agric . assets  and productive  livestock . 
This could  enhance  HH’s  future  income  generating  capacity  and reduce  their 
vulnerability  to future  shocks . Hence,  support  long-term resilience .
•No significant  difference  between  anticipatory  & post-shock  cash recipient  households  on 
FCS,  crop diversification,  mixed  crop-livestock  production,  and post-shock  actions  taken . 
Page 7:
Recommendations
•Given  the generally  positive  findings  on climate  resilience  capacity  and investment,  we 
suggest   humanitarian  agencies  and governments  to consider  anticipatory  interventions  
(such  as pre-shock  cash  transfers)  as a mechanism  for both meeting  basic  needs  (i.e., 
food consumption)  and improving  climate  resilience  of households . 
•As climate  shocks  continue  to worsen  and humanitarian  funding  needs  remain  unmet,  
anticipatory  interventions  may be critical  to meeting  the needs  of climate - and conflict -
affected  households .

Violent Conflicts, Land Allocation, and Related 
Agricultural Investments: Empirical Evidence from 
Nigeria.

www.cgiar.orgObjectives
2
•Conflict  remains  a major  driver  of poverty  in Africa   and conflicts  and political  
instabilities  have been increasing . 
•Explore  the relationship  between  violent  conflicts ; and farmers’  crop land; the share  of 
area planted  and harvested . 
•Implications  of conflict  on household’s  crop choices  and land allocation  decisions . 
•Explore  whether  conflict  shocks  influence  a shift from  high-investment  activities  to 
subsistence  activities .
•The relationship  between  violent  conflicts  and access  to community  services
Page 11:
www.cgiar.orgThe Data
•Geocoded  longitudinal  dataset  based  on an agricultural  survey  administered  in 
Nigeria  across  the three -wave  LSMS -ISA panel  survey . 
•Measured  conflicts  exposure  using  the number  of fatalities  associated  with incidents .
•Farmer’s  land allocation  was measured  using  the share  of area planted  in major  
crops  to total land area cultivated
•Based  on this measure,  we estimate  the effect  of violent  conflicts  on several  crop 
choice  and sales decisions . 
    
Page 12:
www.cgiar.orgKey Descriptive Findings
•Most  of the households  (70%) were  into cereals  production,  38% produced  legumes,  38% 
produced  roots,  while  very few (7%) produced  trees. 
•High  conflict  states : lower  percentage  of hired  labor  and lower  percentage  of purchase  of 
agricultural  inputs
•Land  area planted  with cereals  was higher  in high than in the low conflict  states .
•Area  covered  by roots  and trees is higher  in low than in high conflict  states . 
•HHs in low conflict  states  are more  likely  to engage  in wage  employment  & higher  market  
flexibility . 
Page 13:
www.cgiar.orgKey Empirical Findings
•Conflicts  reduced  land area dedicated  to longer -term crops  but increase  the share  of land 
area dedicated  to short -term crops  such as cereals . 
•Conflicts  reduced  the shares  of land area covered  with crops . Prolonged  conflict  may 
push HHs to exploit  a lower  % of their land for productive  activities
•Significantly  reduce  the shares  of agricultural  land harvested . 
•Conflicts  has a negative  significant  effect  on farmers  access  to market  and cooperatives .
•Negative  direct  effect  on investment  (area  planted,  area harvested)  and indirect  
(destruction  and disruption  of community  services)  
Page 14:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions
Violent conflicts affect land 
allocation patterns and cropping 
patterns, reducing land area 
allocated to longer -term crops 
such as trees and legumes that 
are amenable to longer -term soil 
management practices. 
Violent conflicts reduce market 
participation and hence induces 
production -oriented to satisfy 
own consumption.

Evaluation Questions
1.What is the productivity change gain for PBR cowpea compared to a conventional 
variety?
2.What is the effect of PBR cowpea on insecticide applications?
3.Does reduction in pesticide application translate to better health indicators for farmers 
and their families? 
4.Does the cultivation of PBR cowpea change household consumption of cowpea and/or 
increase cowpea surpluses? 
5.What are the heterogeneous impacts of PBR cowpea adoption by gender, age, and 
other household characteristics?

What is WEAGov ?
-WEAGov  – the Women’s Empowerment in Agrifood Governance 
tool – is an assessment framework to measure women’s voice in 
the agrifood policy process
-Developed by International Food Policy Research Institute 
(IFPRI) researchers and piloted in Nigeria by APRNet
-How can WEAGov  be used?
1.Measure women’s voice across different parts of the policy 
process
2.Identify entry points for raising women’s voice in different 
parts of the policy process
3.Track progress in women’s empowerment in agrifood policy 
process over time
Page 24:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
Page 25:

Women make up only 22%  of 
members of parliament 
worldwide…
… and only 16%  of 
cabinet secretaries
Page 26:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
-Gender equality within agrifood systems is essential to meeting 
SDGs, yet it is difficult to measure and track
-There is a need to identify specific windows and opportunities to 
raise women’s voice in the agrifood policy process in order to 
achieve meaningful progress
Page 27:
WEAGov  covers 3 stages of the policy 
process
Agenda setting, 
Policy design, and 
Policy adoption 
Policy

reformAgenda setting, Policy design, 
and Policy adoption : 
•Why certain social and 
economic problems emerge

Policy implementation
•How policies are implemented 
in practice, including 
budgetary outlays, 
organizational strategies, and 
delivery of servicesPolicy evaluation & reform
•How policies are assessed 
against their objectives to 
know if changes are needed
Page 28:

How is WEAGov data collected? 
5 key measurement steps
▪Agrifood policy & stakeholder mapping → policy content analysis on gender 
integration and analysis of organizations involved in agrifood policy process
▪Desk review of objective, quantitative indicators of women’s empowerment in 
agrifood governance 
-e.g., # women ministers of agrifood agencies
▪Organization survey 
-Quantitative, objective data on staffing, gender strategies, gender activities of agrifood 
organizations
-Survey given to organizations involved in agrifood policy process – public sector (federal 
and state), private sector, and civil society organizations 
▪Expert survey 
-Perceptions and beliefs of key in -country stakeholders in the sector
-e.g., are opportunities for women’s participation well -known and utilized by key civil 
society actors  
-Survey given to leaders and experts in organizations in the agrifood policy process 
▪Technical panels or focus group discussions  
-Deliberate on measurement and validity with country experts

www.cgiar.orgIntroduction
•Government policies affect everyone, yet 
women are underrepresented in policymaking 
(Duflo 2012; Lawless 2015)
•Women’s participation in politics and civic life 
remains comparatively low (Iversen and 
Rosenbluth 2006)
•Reasons may include a lack of relevant skills and 
training, or norms that proscribe such behavior
•Worrisome as:
•Women’s unique policy needs may not be met if they lack voice and agency
•Women’s voice and agency in their community also help support women’s livelihoods

▪W e study youth migrants’ responses to observable characteristics of potential destinations 
and how these responses vary across various forms of migration.
▪Examine the role of observable attributes of potential destinations, both in absolute terms as 
well as relative to origin of migration.
▪Explore potential heterogeneity in the impacts of observable characteristics of potential 
destinations across various types of migrants. 
▪Understand pull factors of youth migration, a country characterized by relatively high rates 
of internal youth migration
▪Dyadic comparison of destinations and origins underscores the analytical importance of 
relative distributions of endowments.

•Migrants  respond  differently  to observable  characteristics  depending  on migration  pattern,  
duration,  and socioeconomic  status .
•Migrants  prefer  destinations  with higher  relative  welfare  and lower  cost of living .
•Rural -rural  migrants  are responsive  to agricultural  productivity  and land availability .
•Rural -urban  and urban -urban  youth  migrants  focus  on welfare  and urban  intensity .
•Permanent  migrants  prioritize  cost of living  but non-poor migrants  prioritize  welfare
•Policy  makers  can encourage  rural -rural  migration  by improving  agricultural  production

Page 53:
What drives farmers, consumers and private sector decisions to 
adopt new varieties and related products?
The problem: New varieties (even if the best ones) are 
often not adopted because of behavioral barriers and 
processes. Examples:
•Benefits from drought -tolerant varieties only 
experienced when there is a drought
•Improved nutritional value: Difficult to observe
With these barriers, how to accelerate varietal 
turnover?
Limited or unpredictable demand will limit private sector 
interest in promoting new varieties and related products.
•How to get private sector to promote new products?
Page 54:
Research Question 1 – How can we accelerate varietal turnover?Main Investment: A behavioral multi -country multi -crop randomized trial
•Six experiments (5 countries) 
•Coordinated experimental designs – common interventions
•Quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, and the same outcome variables.
•Nigeria: Baseline survey completed and seed trial minipack distribution started 
Sites and crops: 
•Nigeria: cowpea, maize
•Ethiopia: teff and wheat
•India: green gram, groundnut, rice
•Kenya: maize, beans, cowpea, green 
gram, sorghum
•Uganda: maize, sweet potato (2 sites)
Page 55:
Study site: Bauchi and Kaduna states, Nigeria 
Sample size: 2,016 households in 252 villages surveyed at baseline
Constraints to adoption of newer 
varieties: 
•Lack of information about new 
varieties
•Farmers are cautious to try out new 
varieties
•Lack of access to improved seeds
•Poor management practices
•Gender -based constraints
❖Women have low access to information, 
improved seeds, inputs, mobility
❖Women lack decision -making in varietal

1•This study explores the value of  quality assurance systems 
with an analysis of  certified seed production and 
distribution in Nigeria.
•Assess the associations between the quantity of  certified 
seeds produced and the spatial variations from where they 
are produced and,
•Spatial variations in the use of  certified seeds and/or 
improved varieties, yields, and output, and their relationship 
with agroclimatic and socioeconomic conditions

www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
4•Yield responses from certified seeds vary depending on the nature of  the farmland 
•When certified seeds are available, both yield and use increase. When it hits its peak, 
the effect of  the increase begins to diminish. 
•There are variations in the yields from certified seed which could be a result of  
climatic conditions and farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics.
•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
Page 64:
www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
5•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
•Farmers in close proximity to certified seed use it and improve their yields and 
outputs. This effect diminishes at the margin due to two factors
1.Yields from certified seeds vary considerably within each state, suggesting either 
quality issues in the supply chain or farmers not using complementary inputs or 
management practices when using quality seed.
2.As certified seed becomes more available to farmers, its use may spread from 
higher -return farms to lower -return farms, thereby diminishing the gains on the 
extensive margin.
Page 65:
www.cgiar.orgPolicy recommendations 
6•Revisit seed certification target in Nigeria
•Prioritize spatially the seed certification expansion effort if  it 
is still of  policy importance
•Promote more decentralized systems, like QDS / community 
seed schemes for rice, cowpeas, and OPV maize (as in various 
Eastern and Southern African countries)

Introduction to SAM
➢SAM  is a systematic  tool for economy -wide  analysis  and policy  prioritization,  used  to 
prioritize  the most  appropriate  investments  and suitable  policies  that can transform  the 
Nigerian  agricultural  food  market  and system .
➢SAM  is a national  accounting  framework  that captures  the circular  flow  of receipts  and 
payments  between  agents  and markets . 
➢SAM  provides  a complete  and consistent  dataset  of all economic  transactions  that takes  
place  within  the socio -economic  system .
➢Some  of the data  source  include : National  accounts  (NBS),  government  financial  statistics  
(Ministry  of Finance,  CBN),  Balance  of Payment  (IMF)  Household  expenditures,  and Labour  
Force  Surveys  etc.
Page 68:
Basic Structure of SAM
➢It sheds  light  on the activities  of the different  
economic  agents  by describing  the 
interrelationship  between  firms,  farms,  
households,  investors  and the external  sector .
➢The flow  of economic  activities  in monetary  terms  
from  expenditure/outflow  (col)  to income/inflow  
(row)
➢Activities  are domestic  firms  that  produce  goods  
and services  (commodities) . Factors  (labour , 
capital  and land)  are important  to produce  
activities . The activities  pay owners/suppliers  of 
factors  (households  – wages  and rents),  
government  (profits,  direct  tax),  and the rest of 
the world  (import,  debt  repayments)

Concept Note:
Stakeholders Consultation Workshop in Tanzania
November 2, 2023
Introduction
The Harnessing Gender and Social Equality for Resilience in Agrifood Systems (HER+) Initiative (or the Gender Equality Initiative for short) seeks to transform agrifood systems by addressing structural gender inequalities such as harmful social and gender norms. Social and gender norms within agrifood systems (AFSs) can impede women's economic and climate resilience, increasing their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The Initiative seeks to transform agrifood systems through gender transformative approaches (GTAs) to bolster women’s economic resilience to climate change challenges. 
As part of the Gender Equality Initiative, Work Package 1 (WP1) instituted three workstreams to implement research along Pathway 1 of our Theory of Change on normative constraints to building economic resilience to climate change challenges:
While the focus of the synthesis conducted by Workstream 1 was at the global level (with a stronger focus on Africa), the research carried out by Workstreams 2 and 3 was focused on three AFS (cassava, chicken, and fish) in two countries in Africa (Tanzania and Nigeria). All three AFS are incredibly important for helping women, men, and youth smallholder farmers and other value chain actors secure their livelihoods in Tanzania and Nigeria. Yet normative constraints create gender inequalities within these AFS and especially limit women’s abilities to build economic resilience. This is important given that climate change related shocks and stressors create additional challenges in Nigeria and Tanzania, as both countries are in climate hotspots (Szabo et al. 2016).
The key outputs produced by these workstreams in 2023 include:
Global evidence synthesis report
Qualitative assessment report
Quantitative assessment report
As a next step in our Theory of Change along Pathway 2, WP1 will convene a stakeholder consultation workshop in Tanzania. The stakeholder consultation workshop will allow WP1 to share key findings from the evidence synthesis and assessment reports for greater understanding of normative constraints that impact women’s abilities to build economic resilience. Using the key findings, stakeholders will be asked to identify specific leverage points and levers to intervene at a deeper level at different institutional levels or arenas (family, community, market, and state) across each of the three AFS.
What are leverage points and levers?
Leverage points refer to “places in complex systems where a small shift may lead to fundamental changes in the system as a whole” (Abson et al. 2017). Identifying “place-specific leverage points” to help especially women build economic resilience to climate change challenges is critical for targeting deep, transformative change (Rosengren et al. 2020). 
The use of a leverage point framework is valuable to locate different types of places to intervene in a system. Meadows (1999) describes 12 different types of systemic points, which are organized according to their potential to create change. The leverage points with weaker power to create change are referred to as “shallow”, while those with greater power to create change are called “deep” leverage points. The 12 leverage points proposed by Meadows (1999) were later categorized into four domains (or realms) by Abson et al. (2017), as shown in Table 1 in Rosengren et al. (2020). The examples shown in Table 1 are especially helpful to look at to begin to understand what constitutes a leverage point. Manlosa et al. (2019) suggest from their research in Ethiopia that it is the interactions between shallower and deeper leverage points that is important to focus on to achieve gender equality and women’s empowerment, as opposed to only focusing on one or the other in isolation. We return to this point below. 
Table 1. The table visualizes the relationship between the four realms of Abson et al. (2017) and the twelve systemic leverage points of Meadows (1999) and examples of leverage points for climate action in an agricultural context.

Levers, on the other hand, are the specific actions or interventions that get implemented to help bring about changes in a system (Chan et al. 2020). So, in our case, these would be the actions or interventions that aim to reduce normative constraints limiting women's capacities to build economic resilience against climate change challenges. Gender transformative interventions are especially important to bring about changes at a deeper level, while trying to “reach” rural women farmers via training them on improved management practices would be considered an intervention linked to a shallower leverage point.
Rosengren et al. (2020) identified 15 place-specific leverage points and associated levers (interventions) using parts of the Meadows (1999) framework (see Table 2). Their examples are quite helpful for seeing, more practically, what constitutes place-specific leverage points and levers, and in their case, for strengthening the adaptive capacity of small-scale farmers in Ghana. Their leverage points and levers included addressing normative constraints that especially limit women’s adaptive capacities, but also those “shallower” leverage points that aim to further build adaptive capacities of women. An example of a shallower leverage point and lever is “access to radio” (leverage point), with the lever (intervention) being to “place a radio in a community space open for all community members and encourage gatherings for the times of the agricultural extension radio programmes.” An example of a deeper leverage point and lever is “patriarchal aspects of the culture” (leverage point), with the lever being “reducing patriarchal aspects of the culture and empowering women.” It is important to note that this latter example is super generic, whereas the evidence base we are presenting at this stakeholder consultation workshop is on specific gendered social norms that impact women’s abilities to build economic resilience. Therefore, workshop participants can narrow the focus when coming up with leverage points and levers at different institutional levels across each AFS unlike with this latter example.

Stakeholder consultation workshop objectives and expected outputs and outcomes
The proposed stakeholder consultation workshop aims to achieve two main objectives, namely to:
Increase the understanding of different stakeholders of the normative constraints that impact women’s abilities to build economic resilience across each of the three AFS.
Identify leverage points and levers for addressing the normative constraints at different institutional levels across each of the three AFS.
Objective 1 will be achieved, in part, by sharing the evidence base generated by Workstreams 1-3 on normative constraints. The evidence base will be included in power point slides and presented by the facilitators of the workshop. Objective 2 will be achieved by implementing the methodology to identify the leverage points and levers that is described below. A brief survey will be administered to workshop participants to gauge their level of understanding of normative constraints pre and post the workshop. A report will be produced after the workshop that will document the different 
leverage points and levers identified by the workshop participants. These will be used to inform the design of gender transformative interventions in 2024 within a select number of partner projects already operating in the northwestern part (Kagera and Kigoma Regions) of Tanzania. Our working knowledge of potential partners already carrying out development projects in Kagera and Kigoma Regions has helped inform the draft participant list further below.
Stakeholder consultation workshop methodology
The workshop will comprise the following key sessions:
Presentation about the Gender Equality Initiative
The session will provide workshop participants with an overview of the Initiative and provide specific details about WP1. Workshop participants will be given some time to ask questions after the presentation.
Presentations and discussions on the evidence base generated by the three workstreams
The session will create a space for each workstream to make a presentation to workshop participants that provides rich details on the normative constraints identified by their workstream. Each workstream lead should develop this presentation and share with the workshop facilitators in Tanzania (and the same for the workshop in Nigeria). Key is highlighting normative constraints across each AFS and not highlighting only aggregated findings. For the evidence synthesis, high-level findings are appropriate given the nature of the review.
Each presentation will be followed by a plenary discussion on the key findings for validation and key learning purposes.
Identification of leverage points and levers
Step 1: The session will first present background information to workshop participants in plenary on leverage points and levers and examples of each. Participants need to understand the differences between shallower and deeper leverage points and levers, so examples of these types will be provided. An exercise can be developed to help participants better understand these concepts and how to develop leverage points and levers from a given evidence base. Participants should be given a space to ask questions about leverage points and levers and facilitators need to make sure everyone is clear before moving to the next step.
Step 2: Participants will then be divided into groups corresponding to the three AFSs (cassava, chicken, and fish). Using the key findings presented by each workstream, workshop participants will be asked to come up with a set of preliminary leverage points and associated levers at different institutional levels similar to the examples in Table 2. While the focus should be on leverage points and levers that address normative constraints, workshop participants should also reflect on their current project activities that focus on “shallower” leverage points and levers to showcase how these can interact with deeper leverage points and levers for gender equality and women’s empowerment outcomes. By also highlighting the shallower leverage points and levers, we can begin to determine the “technical” interventions (e.g., to increase women’s access to improved cassava seed or hybrid chickens or postharvest fish processing technologies) that could be combined with the gender transformative interventions WP1 will design with partners in 2024.
Step 3: After each group identifies their set of leverage points and levers, they will come together in plenary to present their work for further discussions. This will create an opportunity for each group to further refine their set of leverage points and levers after hearing from and discussing with the other groups.
A diagram depicting the flow of the stakeholder consultation workshop can be found below (Figure 1), along with the key output and outcome we hope to produce and achieve, respectively.

Concept Note:
Stakeholders Consultation Workshop in Nigeria
December, 2023
Introduction
The Harnessing Gender and Social Equality for Resilience in Agrifood Systems (HER+) Initiative (or the Gender Equality Initiative for short) seeks to transform agrifood systems by addressing structural gender inequalities such as harmful social and gender norms. Social and gender norms within agrifood systems (AFSs) can impede women's economic and climate resilience, increasing their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The Initiative seeks to transform agrifood systems through gender transformative approaches (GTAs) to bolster women’s economic resilience to climate change challenges. 
As part of the Gender Equality Initiative, Work Package 1 (WP1) instituted three workstreams to implement research along Pathway 1 of our Theory of Change on normative constraints to building economic resilience to climate change challenges:
While the focus of the synthesis conducted by Workstream 1 was at the global level (with a stronger focus on Africa), the research carried out by Workstreams 2 and 3 was focused on three AFS (cassava, chicken, and fish) in two countries in Africa (Tanzania and Nigeria). All three AFS are incredibly important for helping women, men, and youth smallholder farmers and other value chain actors secure their livelihoods in Tanzania and Nigeria. Yet normative constraints create gender inequalities within these AFS and especially limit women’s abilities to build economic resilience. This is important given that climate change related shocks and stressors create additional challenges for all groups in Nigeria and Tanzania, as both countries are in climate hotspots (Szabo et al. 2016).
The key outputs produced by these workstreams in 2023 include:
Global evidence synthesis report
Qualitative assessment report
Quantitative assessment report
As a next step in our theory of change along Pathway 2, WP1 will convene a stakeholder consultation workshop in Nigeria. The stakeholder consultation workshop will allow WP1 to share key findings from the evidence synthesis and assessment reports for greater understanding of normative constraints that impact women’s abilities to build economic resilience. Using the key findings, stakeholders will be asked to identify specific leverage points and levers to intervene at a deeper level at different institutional levels or arenas (family, community, market, and state) across each of the three AFS.
What are leverage points and levers?
Leverage points refer to “places in complex systems where a small shift may lead to fundamental changes in the system as a whole” (Abson et al. 2017). Identifying “place-specific leverage points” to help especially women build economic resilience to climate change challenges is critical for targeting deep, transformative change (Rosengren et al. 2020). 
The use of a leverage point framework is helpful to locate different types of places to intervene in a system. Meadows (1999) describes 12 different types of systemic points, which are organized according to their potential to create change. The leverage points with weaker power to create change are referred to as “shallow”, while those with greater power to create change are called “deep” leverage points. The 12 leverage points proposed by Meadows (1999) were later categorized into four domains (or realms) by Abson et al. (2017), as shown in Table 1 in Rosengren et al. (2020). The examples shown in Table 1 are especially helpful to look at to begin to understand what constitutes a leverage point. Manlosa et al. (2019) suggest from their research in Ethiopia that it is the interactions between shallower and deeper leverage points that is important to focus on to achieve gender equality and women’s empowerment, as opposed to only focusing on one or the other in isolation. We return to this point below. 
Table 1. The table visualizes the relationship between the four realms of Abson et al. (2017) and the twelve systemic leverage points of Meadows (1999) and examples of leverage points for climate action in an agricultural context.

GENDER-SENSITIVE NUTRITION TRAININGS IN MAKUENI AND NAKURU: KENYA IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
Ukama Ustawi (UU) is a regional project promoting diversification for resilient agrifood 
systems in East (Kenya) and Southern (Zambia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe) Africa, as part of the One CGIAR Gender Equality Initiative (HER+). In Kenya, the project is being implemented 
in five counties (Nakuru, Makueni, Narok, Embu and Kakamega) by the Kenya Agricultural 
and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), with support from Africa Conservation Tillage Network (ACTN), Cereal Growers Association (CGA) and Ministry of Agriculture - Climate Change Unit. This work targets men, women and young smallholder farmers, with KALRO implementing Work Package 1 (Diversify and Sustainably Intensify) of the 
project aimed at developing and evaluating technologies that will enhance production and 
resilience in maize-based cropping systems. Activities, including conservation agriculture (CA), crop diversification and intensification underway in Nakuru, Makueni, Embu, and Kakamega counties, implemented by KALRO Njoro, Katumani, Embu and Kakamega, 
respectively. 
Under WP 1, Activity 1 proposes developing strategies to improve and foster dietary 
diversification and healthy diets. To achieve this, the HER+ initiative collaborated with UU to provide a gender-sensitive training which is one of the social innovations provided 
through the socio-technical innovation bundles approach. This training was organized in 
two of the counties to train farmers and partners on how gender roles, responsibilities influence diets and nutrition. It focused on why men should be engaged in nutritional activities as we look at intrahousehold decisions made on what to grow and what to eat. Engage the participants on food bias, rituals and customary taboos that influence food 
access and consumption. Lastly, we will also do some product optimization and testing to 
assess participants perception of bean-based products.1. Introduction
2. Objectives of the gender-sensitive training
Training objectives were to:
• Train members of farmer groups on gender-sensitive nutrition.
• Create awareness of the benefits of joint decision-making for better health and wealth.
• Train participants on a balanced diet and link it with food we grow
• Test different bean-based products.

3. Training venues and dates
4. Structure of the trainingThe training was conducted in two counties, Makueni and Nakuru, where Ukama Ustawi 
is carrying out CA and crop intensification demonstrations (in mother and baby demos). In Makueni, trainings were held in two sites, at the Redeemed Gospel church in Mbumbuni, 
Kiseu/Kiteta Ward, Mbooni West Sub-County on 18 August 2023 and at Wote County Hall, 
Wote Ward, Makueni Sub-County on 24 August 2023. 
In Nakuru county, the trainings were held in three locations: Boito (AIC Church), Visoi 
Ward, Rongai Sub-County on 28 August 2023 at the World-Wide Church, Kihingo Ward, 
Njoro Sub-County on 29 August 2023; and at Munanda, Church Compound, Elementaita 
Ward, Gilgil sub-county on 30 August 2023.
The training was implemented as a dialogue between the trainers and trainees. Trainees 
were actively engaged in discussions, and the information gathered was used to guide the 
training further. The sessions were divided into five major parts.

5.1 What is gender-sensitive nutrition
This interactive session, shown in Figure 1, aimed to obtain the community’s perception 
or understanding of gender, nutrition, and gender-sensitive nutrition. It involved questions on who buys food, sources of food (farm, market/shop), who prepares food, who decides 
what to grow and cook, and the different types of food bought or otherwise sourced by 
different people in the household. From the above questions, it became clear that men and women have different roles and responsibilities relating to food access and preparation. It centred on who decides where food is grown, sourced and consumed and how this affects household diets, nutrition and health. Discussions also touched on food taboos, rituals 
and religious obligations.

To emphasize the importance of paying attention to gender in nutrition, a short drama 
on the need for joint visioning and decision-making was enacted by the gender expert at the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT. This drama was illustrated through three voluntary 
participants. The idea is to have a couple and an outsider. The outsider would love or envy 
the couple and want to break them up (Figure 2).  If the couple works together, they are like two sticks combined compared to one stick for the outsider. So, each volunteer was asked to break the single and double stick. The single stick was easily broken, but the double stick could not be broken. This symbolized that outsiders could easily influence 
a couple where each person did things independently. The doubled stick bundled stick 5. Training

could not be broken, and it symbolized a united couple that made all family decisions with 
little outside interference, leading to increased productivity and better decision on farm, health and nutrition.

A list of the foods available in the community was compiled. This was to create awareness in trainees and trainers about the diversity and accessibility of food to families in the communities and aided the nutritionist when talking about balanced diets and diversity in 
the different communities. The effect of seasonality on the availability of certain foods and 
family nutrition was discussed. 
5.2 Role play on meals and diets
We enacted a role play to showcase food quality and quantity across diverse household types. This role play also shows what different individuals in different households consider to be a balanced diet or healthy food for the households. We also saw that socio-economic 
factors also played a role in the food often bought and consumed in diverse households.

Three volunteers were invited to participate in the role-play. These volunteers were often 
two women and a man. In most cases, we had a variant of married women, single women or elderly and younger women and men who were widowers or single. Different foods/
products were availed (Figure 4). The three were requested to pick (“shop for”) items they 
preferred in order to prepare a family meal.

Each was free to select the foods/products they wished to prepare for their family during 
lunch. The items were placed on three manila-labeled papers according to those who constituted the family. We limited the categories to husband, wife and children, as shown 
below in Figure 5.
FIGURE 5: Labeled manila papers for portioning a family meal according to gender.

Each volunteer freely made their food choices and arranged these on the papers. Food 
used to prepare the meals, like oil, onion, tomatoes, maize or wheat flour, was placed at the centre. Other items split equally between the family might also be placed in the middle. 
The rest were shared by placing them in the respective papers allocated for each family 
member (Figures 6 and 7).

Trainees then moved around to see the choices made by the volunteers, as shown in 
Figures 8, 9, 10). Each volunteer described the meal chosen, the proportions served and the reasons behind their choices. The session involved open and free discussions, 
questions, and answers on why a particular food was chosen servings (type and portion) 
for each gender.

5.3  What’s a balanced diet – men, women, children, pregnant 
women, children under five, and the elderly. 
The nutritionist took over and explained which of the volunteer’s choices was better and 
why. What was needed to improve the choices to be more nutritious? Issues on food taboos relating to transition rituals and pregnant women were discussed.

Pregnant women, children under five years, and the elderly are often disadvantaged and 
vulnerable when it comes to nutrition in the family. Proper attention is required to ensure they get the required quantity and quality of food to meet their nutrition requirements. 
A nutritionist (Figure 11, 12) facilitated this session. The nutritionist was guided by the 
choices of food made by the volunteers and the resulting discussions, together with the knowledge of the types of food available in the area. Emphasis was made on nutrition requirements for pregnant and breast-feeding women, children under the age of five years 
and the elderly.

5.4 Tasting and ranking of value-added bean products
Beans are an important part of a nutritious family diet. The Nyota variety is preferred for 
household use due to its high iron and zinc content. Various products prepared with and without the addition of Nyota bean value-added flour were prepared and displayed for 
organoleptic tasting and ranking (Figure 13).

6.1 Gender-sensitive nutrition
Joint planning by the family was found to be important to reduce influence from outsiders 
and consequent failure of planned farm and food activities. It was also important for the family to know what is essential for their diets and to plan together. Sometimes, the food 
consumed had little or no nutritive value depending on the socio-economic categories 
of the decision-maker in the household. Relatives could assist those who lived alone in deciding which nutritious foods to eat. The family is stronger when together.
6.2 Gender roles
Male and female members of the family sourced food from all the sites. The food was sourced from the farm or bought from the market and shops. It was, however, the woman’s responsibility to ensure that the family had a meal, whether she got the money from the 
husband to purchase it or sourced it from the farm. Women got most of the food from the 
farm and only bought goods when there was drought and crop failure or when supported by the husband (if not on a paying job). Men bought food when they had money or when requested by their wives to do so. 
6.2.1 Who cooks?
Traditionally, only women were supposed to cook while men herded the family livestock. This has changed as it was reported that some men were involved in cooking, especially when their spouse was unwell or away from home. Girls (more 
often than boys) also cooked to assist their mothers or when they were away. 
6.2.2 Determination of what is to be cooked
The woman often decided what was to be cooked and used her judgement to know 
what was best or available for the family. This usually depended on the availability of a particular food. Sometimes the women made the decision following a request 
from a family member for a change of food/diet. The energy source for cooking 
and the time involved in preparation and cooking also determined the choice of food to be cooked. Children (boys and girls) without parents made their own decisions. Similarly, men made decisions in families where mothers were missing, either through death or otherwise. There was no defined budget for purchasing 
food. Those who had a budget for food did not follow it strictly. This was because 
most of the food was sourced from the farm and was not costed (except when stored food from the farm got finished).
6.2.3 Who was served first
Most participants agreed that the man was usually served first because he was the head of the family and deserved respect. Others attributed this to the cultural norms where men were given first priority in all activities. In some families 6. Discussions
Page 16:
16
GENDER-SENSITIVE NUTRITION TRAININGS IN MAKUENI AND NAKURU: KENYA IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
the youngest child was the first to be served. Men were given a larger portion 
because they were the heads of the family. A few got the same serving as the rest of the family members or shared their portion with younger children (especially 
grandchildren). 
6.2.4 Food for different gender
Some types of food were customarily reserved for men alone. In the Kamba 
community for instance, the tongue and liver were eaten by men and not women. However, this is no longer the case in all the five sites, a practice attributed to 
increased exposure of members in the different communities. 
6.2.5 Seasonality and family diets
Seasonality plays an important role in family diets. Only what was available on the 
farm at different times of the season/ year could be eaten at a particular time. For example, green vegetables were only available to most farmers during the rainy 
season. Some foods could only be bought from the market when out of season. 
A big percentage of fruits in Makueni were sold, and only small quantities were reserved for family consumption. Foods commonly consumed in the communities are shown in Table 1 below.

7.1 Elderly ladies
Generally, the elderly ladies were said to have chosen food that represented a balanced 
diet for their families. They had starch as the main food, green vegetables, fruits, water, and a balanced serving for all genders. Children received a good portion of those foods 
required for their growth and development (Figure 16).
FIGURE 16: Arrangement by an elderly lady in Nakuru shows a balanced diet choice and equal portions for all genders.

7.2 Young ladies
The young ladies chose food that was easy to prepare. In most cases this was not 
nutritionally balanced. The children were apportioned snacks and fruits (Figure 18)

7.3 Selection by men
Food chosen by men varied from simple meals of unbalanced diets to balanced full 
meals (Figure 19). The simple meals were selected based on them requiring little initial preparation. Men did not want to spend a lot of time preparing food and pre-preparing 
vegetable was considered tedious and substituted often with meat.

7.4  Nutritional value of food for pregnant women, children under 
five and the elderly
Requirements for different family members were discussed. Everyone in the family 
needs a balanced and nutritious diet. Meals should consist of the five groups of food (starch, proteins, vitamins, lipids, and mineral nutrients) and plenty of drinking water. The 
importance of iron and zinc at the early development stage of the child (1-2 years) was 
reiterated. The best diets are required during the first eleven years of a child’s growth for proper brain and body development. 
Lactating and pregnant mothers require foods rich in iron, iodine, and amino acids. These 
groups should eat for two (up to five times daily). Pregnant women need iron, calcium, and 
plenty of water. 
The elderly suffer from loss of energy and diseases that result from ageing. Usually, most 
of them have teeth problems and are lonely. This group of people require nutrient-rich 
foods, especially proteins and balanced proportions from other food groups.

The training involved active dialogue between the farmers (trainees) and facilitators thus 
encouraging a free atmosphere and flow of information. The information from farmers in all the five sites indicated that food is mainly sourced from the farms by the women who 
are also the main decision-makers for daily family meals. Men buy food when necessary. 
Empowering both women and men on the most nutritious foods and how to cook them for the family is important. The role playing showed that elderly ladies were more knowledgeable about balanced family nutrition compared to younger women. Therefore, the younger ladies need to be the target of nutrition trainings to improve the health of 
family members. 
The UU and HER+ Kenya team acknowledges funding for the trainings and are grateful 
to the farmers for their participation. Thanks also goes the Makueni and Nakuru County Extension Staff who were instrumental in mobilizing the farmers and also giving technical 
input. We thank Olga Spellman, and Vincent Johnson, Science Editors (Alliance of

1PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
The HER+ initiative, in partnership with the Alliance of Bioversity International 
and CIAT, WorldVeg, and SNV, collaborates with the Lersha platform by Green Agro Solution PLC. This partnership aligns its vision with HER+ to support the 
Veggies for Planet and People (V4P&P) project intervention through integrating 
social innovations - digital advisory services, input provision, market linkages, and access to finance for over 4,500 vegetable producers in the Wolmera and Ejere Woredas. The focus is on promoting sustainable agriculture and rural development in the West Show Zone of the Oromia region. Key highlights of the 
project include extensive farmer registration efforts, the engagement of 12 active 
agents, and the establishment of four retailer shops within the two woredas.
Objectives
The HER+ initiative aims to support the Veggies for Planet and People (V4P&P) project intervention. This support involves co-designing socio-technical innovation bundles, which include digital solutions. The aim is to enhance 
the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in the Wolmera and Ejere woredas by 
improving their access to social and technical bundles such as agricultural inputs, knowledge, and financial services. Ultimately, this effort would contribute to increasing the region’s agricultural productivity and food security as farmers become more empowered and resilient.

2MILESTONES ACHIEVED
Project Launch:
The project officially began on July 1, 2023, with the signing of the funding 
agreement.
The second phase aimed to lay the groundwork for successful project 
implementation. The project’s scope and objectives were meticulously defined during this phase through extensive discussions.
Stakeholder Engagement: 
Key stakeholders, including local partners and relevant authorities, were identified and engaged in the planning process.
Project Scope & field assessment: 
The project was geographically focused on the West Showa Zone, specifically in the Wolmera and Ejere woredas, indicating a localized and targeted approach.
The HER+ Initiative involved an in-depth field assessment of various aspects 
of agriculture in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. The findings revealed the predominant cultivation of a variety of vegetables by women farmers, guided by well-documented cropping calendars and varied productivity. Agricultural practices encompassed soil preparation, seed selection, irrigation, and effective 
input utilization, as well as livestock management and marketing strategies. The 
accessibility and affordability of agricultural inputs, extension services, market services, post-harvest technologies, and financial services exhibited variations between the woredas. Despite challenges, women played pivotal roles in different 
stages of vegetable production. These insights are pivotal for informed decision-
making, facilitating targeted interventions to promote agricultural sustainability and gender equity in the region. Notably, farmers with access to SNV assistance showed significant improvements in various aspects of vegetable production compared to others.
Targeted Farmers: The project aimed to register over 5,000 farmers, focusing 
on women farmers, in the West Showa Zone, specifically in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. This implies a significant outreach effort to include a large portion of the farming community.

Input Procurement: The registered farmers could conveniently procure 
essential agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides through digital platforms. This can streamline the supply chain, making inputs more 
accessible and cost-effective.
Lersha Agents Training” was delivered at the Green Agro-Solution (GAS) 
office from September 25-26, 2023. The training aimed to refresh and enhance the information and skills of the potential Lersha agents in various areas, 
including agronomy, livestock production, Lersha application practice, and 
communication, entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, gender, and onboarding steps. The training was conducted for two consecutive days, with 12 potential Lersha agents, of which 4 are women from two woredas and the agricultural 
office focal from SNV retailers participating. On the second day, representatives 
from the Woreda agricultural offices and agro-dealers joined the training to encourage the onboarding process. To develop engagement and participation, the training was designed with various group activities, group work, and case studies in combination with PowerPoint slides and brochures. By organizing the 
agents into groups, we encouraged discussion, collaboration, and sharing of 
perspectives and experiences.

More recently, there has been an increase in the use of Multistakeholder Platforms (MSP) by several actors within CGIAR and beyond. Multistakeholder dialogues aim to ensure that there is a discussion on challenges facing communities within the different landscapes and how solutions are crafted to address the challenges through practical development interventions. This paper, firstly, engages with literature on MSPs and how gender equality and social inclusion can be made intentional by including women and youths in the processes. Secondly, through the practical implementation of the Aquatic Foods Initiative in Zambia, the actual assessments and practical implementation are being monitored and critiqued through the process documentation of MSP implementation to ensure that women and youths are included. The documentation goes beyond inclusion to document the outcomes of women and youth inclusion. Thirdly, this paper situates MSPs within the CGIAR’s MSPs’ broader community of practice to draw further common threads across different contexts, different resources and across different scales. The early findings demonstrate that it is possible to engage women and youths in the designing, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the MSPs. Such engagement needs to be intentional and must invest time and resources in ensuring that participation goes beyond attendance to informing and influencing the priorities and even going further to ensure those priorities are implemented and reflected upon.

  INTRODUCTION  
Initiative to Increase Women’s Voice and Agency in 
Demanding  Assets for Climate Resilience  
 
The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) , one of the research centers 
within the global Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) , 
has a long history of gender research relevant to its mission of reducing poverty and 
ending hunger and malnutrition. Over the last two decades, gender has been 
effectively incorporated into all of IFPRI’s strategic research areas and into all phases 
of research . There is abundant e vidence of IFPRI’s role as a leading global think tank 
on gender issues .  
The broader CGIAR  shares IFPRI’s  strong commitment to high -quality  gender 
research. This commitment is embodied in the CGIAR Gender Impact Platform, the 
CGIAR Research Initiative on Gender Equality, and a network of gender research 
coordinators embedded in all CGIAR centers. Collectively, these efforts and their 
affiliat ed gender researchers work continuously with partners to fill gender and 
inclusion evidence gaps; build capacity and set directions to enable CGIAR to have 
maximum impact on gender equality;  and promote opportunities for youth and social 
inclusion in agriculture and food systems.  
IFPRI leads the Methods Module of the Gender Platform, developing, maintaining, 
and disseminating tools and guides on gathering and analyzing gender -
disaggregated data . Perhaps most prominently, i n 2012 , USAID commissioned 
researchers at  IFPRI and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative  to 
develop the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI),  a tool designed to 
measure the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural 
sector. Over the past 11 years, the tool has been used by over 2 49 organizations 
across 60 countries to track and measure women’s empowerment, and IFPRI 
researchers have evaluated the effectiveness of different ways to raise women’s 
empowerment through various  policies and programs.  
Two CGIAR research initiatives —Gender Equality and National Policies and Strategies —
have partnered to launch and evaluate programming designed to raise women’s 
ability to exercise  their voice and agency in community settings. Specifically, this 
training manual focuses on developing the skills necessary to articulate aspirations 
and goals related to individual and community assets that could be built through the  
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act  (MGNREGA ) program  in 1 
Page 5:
 
4 
 India . The MGNREGA is  a rural workfare program  that guarantees a certain number of 
days of unskilled manual work per year to rural households at a specified minimum 
wage; this labor is used to create durable assets that can serve as the basis for 
sustainable livelihoods. Crucially, MNREGA  envisions a ‘bottom -up’ process of 
deliberation,  in which all members of communities have a right to participate in the 
village -level meetings where the shelf of works is agreed upon  and are empowered 
to play a role in decision -making about wh ich assets to build.   
The first step toward the development of this training manual  was a baseline 
assessment  conducted in early 2023. The assessment looked at women’s access to 
information  and understanding about how to request assets and whether  they have 
tried and been successful in the past at requesting an asset. The assessment occurred  
with over 3,000 randomly  sampled MGNREGA women job card holders in  five 
districts across the state of Odisha  (Figure 1) : Balangir , Ganjam, Kalahandi, 
Mayurbhanj, and Rayagada. These districts were chosen to represent different agro -
climatic zones as well as differing levels of engagement with the MGNREGA  program . 
 
 
Figure 1: Odisha State  
 
Page 6:

 Key findings of the assessment include:  
• Women’s overall knowledge of program rules  regarding work and asset 
demand  is low .  
• Yet, many women have an idea of what they would request if they had the 
chance . 
• There is considerable variation across districts in whether women have ever 
tried to request an asset —ranging from 55 percent of our sample in Balangir to 
4 percent in Mayurbhanj —but very few women have ever been successful in the 
past at requesting an asset.  
• About half of women in our sample report at least some comfort with speaking 
up in public but say that community officials at village -level meetings at which 
asset construction is discussed only pay attention to women “to some extent.”  
 
This suggests three  significant disconnects between program goals of including 
communities in the process of planning for what MGNREGA assets would be built 
through the program and the experience of rural women. First, there is an 
informational gap : many women do hold ideas about assets that would be useful to 
them to improve their livelihoods and their resilience,  but they lack specific 
information about how to put those ideas into practice. Second, there is a skills gap : 
women may hold ideas about what wo uld be useful to them and either already know 
about the formal process for requesting asset s or be able to quickly learn the process 
when provided with information . Yet, they  lack the skills and confidence needed to 
navigate the more informal parts of community planning processes like speaking up 
in public fora, clearly articulating demands, and coordinating with other stakeholders 
in the community. Third, the assessment revealed a responsiveness gap , suggesting 
that local leaders and government functionaries are not always responsive to ideas 
even when women are able to  navigate formal or informal processes  to submit 
proposals .   
Based on the assessment outlined above and IFPRI’s global experience working on 
issues related to women’s empowerment in the agricultural sector, IFPRI researchers 
developed the current curriculum, ‘Planning for Voice, ’ to equip women with key 
knowledge and skills to help them navigate the process of demanding  assets through 
the MGNREGA.  The curricul um addresses both the informational and skills gaps. It is 
possible that other types of interventions and programming would be needed to 
address the responsiven ess gap ; in short, information and skills may not themselves 
be sufficient .  
The curriculum is structured to work in small groups of women over the course of 2.5 
hours. Women in rural areas have significant obligations on their time , including 
Page 7:
 
6 
 unpaid care work,  and often have limited mobility.  It can be difficult  for them  to 
devote extensive periods of time to attend training sessions . Often, training sessions 
can be quite long, taking place over the course of several full days and conducted in 
large groups. Further, when many strangers are brought together in a central location 
to discuss potentially sensitive topics, there is a need to spend considerable time 
during the training introducing women to each other and ensuring that they feel 
comfor table enough with each other to speak up and share their ideas. This type of 
lengthy intervention might inadvertently exclude women for whom travel to a central 
location is difficult and who cannot easily find someone else to assume their 
household and economic responsibilities for longer periods of time.  
By contrast, ‘Planning for Voice’ is designed to work with women in small groups  
within their existing social networks , so that each woman  receives intensive focus and 
opportunities for practicing skills during a condensed time period.  By allowing 
women to select friends and neighbors who can participate in the training session 
with them from pre -existing social groups, this  format  capitalizes on existing social 
networks and bonding  amongst women , thus freeing up meeting  time for content 
and skill develop ment.   
By the end of the course, participants should be able to:  
• Understand the basic process for requesting a MGNREGA asset  and the key 
local stakeholders involved  
• Describe a MGNREGA asset that could improve their individual lives or 
livelihoods or improve the community more broadly  
• Articulate different ways that they could play a role in influencing what their 
community decides to build  
• Develop a strategy to overcome foreseen barriers to exercising their voice  and 
agency in their community

  OUTLINE OF 
MODULE S  
The ‘Planning for Voice’ curriculum is approximately 2.5 hours long and includes 6 
core modules, outlined  in the table  below : (A) providing information about the 
MNREGA program  and women’s rights under it ; (B) screening an inspirational video;

  HOW TO DELIVER 
THE CURRICULUM  
 
Preparing in Advance  
This is quite a busy agenda in a condensed time period, and preparation will b e key 
to ensur e that participants can cover all of the activities and topics in the allotted time 
period. Facilitators are expected to be familiar with the curriculum in advance and  to 
have reviewed all activities and modules before facilitating it. Other essential steps 
include congregating a small group (e.g., either by asking a target woman to identify 
friends/ neighbors who can join her, or otherwise tapping into existing group s to find 
a set of women willing to be trained); finding a safe place to conduct the training 
where women can have discussions  in private ; ensuring you select a time that works 
with women’s schedules ; having printed informational leaflets on hand; and setting 
up a way to screen the movie s, which may vary across contexts. Ideally, a battery -
powered projector will be used so that women can easily see the movie on a larger 
screen and so that electricity will not be required .  
Congregating a Group  
Existing groups have substantial social capital that is known to be important for 
empowering women both inside and beyond their household. Even outside of formal 
groups with regular meetings, women often have substantial social capital in the form 
of friends and neighbors who can be relied upon to provide support of many forms – 
financial, moral, etc. A strength of this curriculum lies in tapping this existing social 
capital , which can take extensive amounts of time to generate within the context of a 
newly -formed group of women who may not know each other very well, or may live 
sufficiently far away that they cannot realistically provide the type of support a woman 
may need.  3 
Page 11:
 
10 
 A key goal of the facilitator is identifying where th is social capital lies and 
approaching women to sign up for training. It is not the goal of the facilitator to form 
groups or ask women who may not know each other at all to come together. Rather, 
women should be engaged in a discussion of who are friends or neighbors (they may 
not be family members)  with whom they would like to participate in such a training. A 
target woman with whom a facilitator is talking may not immediately know who to 
name, but can be encouraged to describe: a) who are those women you rely on when 
you need something, or want to talk about something? b) when you wish to achieve a 
goal and need support from another woman, who do you consult? And c) do you 
participate in any groups with  other women? If so, who are women in those groups 
with whom you regularly talk?  
If the woman has many more friends and neighbors than can be accommodated, the 
facilitator should ask the woman  who among this group are the most central or 
important women amongst them  to her own personal social network . With a list of 
women, the facilitator can help the woman devise the appropriate strategy to 
approach them – either asking the women to round them up and arrive at the training 
venue with the women, or recruiting some of them his/herself.  
Creating an Environment Where Women Feel Comfortable  
It is important that women feel comfortable contributing and speaking up during the 
session. Some women may be naturally more vocal than others; the small groupings 
among known friends and neighbors are designed to ensure that even those who are 
naturally more reluctant to speak in large groups have a chance to practice their skills 
in a safe and comfortable setting. In contrast, in large groups, hesitant or shy women 
may successfully avoid practicing their skills and revert mostly to watching others 
practice. The curriculum is designed to include group activities and role play, which 
should provide women an opportunity to interac t more freely without feeling put ‘on 
the spot’ to produce an answer about a topic where they may not yet feel 
knowledgeable. Further, the fact that women already have a good deal of social 
capital with these women should help them continue to practice and engage with the 
women after going home.   
It is a good idea to start the session by explaining the goals of the training. The 
facilitator should start by read ing the following script to women :  
The following training is meant to support you, as women, to engage in the 
participatory process of asset selection under the M GNREGA program. You will 
be compensated for your time through a small snack  but will not receive any 
cash payment. It is our intention  that the training will position you to better 
engage with leaders , community members , and family members  in ways that 
ensure that the M GNREGA program supports you as a woman.  
Page 12:
 
11 
 After you begin,  it is your role as a facilitator to ensure that the session stays on topic 
and to redirect conversation if it veers off topic. It is also key that facilitators take care 
and have strategies for encouraging women who overpower conversation dynamics 
to listen and encouraging women who do not speak to participate . At the end of the 
session, you should recap ‘lessons learned’ and any important points made by 
women during the session as a reminder and to reinforce learning.  
At an appropriate moment during the session, women should be provided with  their 
snack  (e.g., chai  and a hot food item from a local vendor) . 
List of materials  
The following materials should be brought to each training:  
1. This manual.  
2. The information leaflets (bring 5-7 to each meeting).  
3. Projector  (ideally battery -powered)  
4. A white sheet to hang on the wall.  
5. Something to hang the sheet.  
6. Flip chart and marker.  
Instructions for Facilitators  
Each module contains a mix of things that the facilitator can say or explain to the 
participants ; things that the facilitator might ask the group , to spark conversation ; and 
activities that the group will complete together. These are clearly marked within each 
module:  
 SAY : 
These are things that the facilitator can say out loud to the 
participants, e.g. , introducing a new topic or concept.  
 ASK : 
These are question prompts that the facilitator should ask 
participants. If participants do  not jump in right away, consider 
rephrasing the question and offering examples for 
participants to react to.  
 
 ACTIVITY:  
These are activities that the facilitator will lead with the 
participants. Activities may involve getting up and moving 
around, acting, and drawing pictures. Have fun and try to get 
everyone participating.

INFORMATION    
*Allow 10 minutes to complete  
 
MATERIALS NEEDED  
• Information leaflets .  
 
Pass out the informational leaflets to begin the session.  
 
 SAY : 
We would like to start off our session with telling you a bit 
about the process for selecting assets in the Mahatma Gandhi 
National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 
Odish a. I have given each of you a leaflet which contains the 
information I am about to share with you now. This is yours to 
keep, and you can show it to your households, friends, and 
neighbors. As you know, given many of your households are 
MGNREGA job card ho lders, MGNREGA is a flagship social 
welfare program that aims to provide em ployment and 
livelihood security to rural households. One key component 
of this program is asset construction.  
 
All MGNREGA workers, that is, those who have a job card, 
have a right to participate in the Gram Sabha, Palli Sabha, or 
Ward Sabha and collectively propose the works and the order 
of priority to be taken up under MGNREGA for their 
Panchayat. Deciding which assets to select is a participatory 
process and all citizens, including women, have the  right to 
give inputs. These meetings are the place where the citizens’ 
voices are heard.  
 
You can request individual or community works under 
MGNREGA. Individual works are only for your household. 
A) 
Page 15:
 
14 
 Community works can serve multiple households, the whole 
village, or multiple members of your self -help group. 
Participating allows your voice to be heard and counted!  
 
So, what assets can you choose? Many types. The government 
has identified a list of works that are allowed under the Act. 
Some assets are declared by the Government as priority for 
2023 -24. For this year, assets related to natural resource 
management, agriculture and livelihoods works on individual 
land and livestock shelters for individual households are 
priority. You can check what is allowed with government 
officia ls (Gram Rozgaar Sewak (GRS) / Sarpanch) or Odisha 
government.  
 
Assets that have been created in your area so far include 
roads, community ponds, individual nurseries, land 
development works like land leveling and clearing, dug wells, 
farm ponds, goat shelters, horticulture plantations, and 
aquaculture, among others.  
 
So, who is preferred for individual assets on land or 
homesteads?  
 
First, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, nomadic and de -
notified tribes are preferred.  
 
Second, BPL households, women, or households headed by 
physically handicapped are a priority.  
 
Third, land reform beneficiaries, beneficiaries under the 
Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana -Gramin, beneficiaries under the 
Scheduled Tribes, and other Traditional Forest Dwellers are 
prioritized.  
 
Finally, small and medium farmers with less than 5 acres of 
land, landless and manual casual labor households are 
preferred.  
 
The only requirements are that their household has a job card, 
and at least one household member is willing to work on the 
project undertaken on their land or homestead.  
 
So, when can you demand assets? The process kickstarts from 
October 2! The Government has suggested that the Gram 
Page 16:
 
15 
 Panchayat level discussion and planning by ward / palli / 
Gram Sabha start on Gandhi Jayanti and continue over the 
next three months.  
 
Demands for assets can be raised at the ward and palli sabha. 
Speaking out gives citizens a chance to ensure their voice is 
heard and is necessary for their priorities to be considered 
and included in the annual “action plan” that is created as a 
result of  these meetings.  
 
Following these meetings, a Special Gram Sabha for approval 
of the Gram Panchayat level annual action plan usually 
happens between October 3rd and November 30th. The Gram 
Panchayat then has to submit the GP level plan to the Block 
Panchayat by December 5th. Timelines might be delayed this 
year due to the sarpanch strike. To learn about the key dates 
in your community, you can check with your sarpanch or Gram 
Rozgaar Sewak (GRS). Checking can ensure that you as 
women do not lose your chance to participate.  
 
For more information, speak to your GRS, ward members, or 
panchayat members! Their jobs include supporting all 
citizens, including women.  
 
This process happens every year. So, if you don’t have an idea 
for this year, please consider an asset for next year!

 VIDEO SCREENING   
 
 
*Allow 20 -25 minutes to complete  
 
MATERIALS NEEDED  
• Projector , screen,1 and comfortable seating arrangement for participants. 
Private place to screen the film away from other household members.  
 
 SAY : 
You are about to watch a short movie. This movie —“The Power 
of Voice: MGNREGA Success Stories ”—shows the stories of 
real women from Odisha State who participate d in asset 
selection as part of  the MGNREGA program and were able to 
suggest and receive an asset through the program. They will 
talk about their experiences in trying to obtain assets, different 
obstacles that they faced, and how they overcame them. We’ll 
all watch the movie together. There will be a few key places 
where I’ll pause the movie so that we can all talk about it.   
 
 
*Screen the movie.  There will be 4 -5 places in the film where the movie indicates 
that you should stop and discuss the question on the movie screen. Please 
ensure that you pause at these key places and discuss the questions on the 
screen. You should read the questions aloud  to ensure that everyone 
understands.  
 
 
1 The screen could be a light -colored blank wall or a light colored bedsheet or similar.

 VIDEO DISCUSSION: 
Overcoming Barriers  
 
 
*Allow 10-15 minutes to complete . If discussion has been robust during the 
questions posed during the video, this module will be shorter. If the discussion 
has been relatively brief during the video itself, then this module should be 
extended.  
 
OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this module is to talk about how the themes and ideas seen in the 
video relate to participating  women’s own lives. Specifically, this discussion should 
focus on highlight ing any barriers that the women in the video identified to achieving 
their asset construction goals and how they overcame those barriers. Then, 
participants should discuss whether they have faced any of the same challenges (or 
heard about others who have) and brainstorm what barriers they might face in their 
own lives if they were to request  MGNREGA assets and how those might be 
overcome.  
 
MATERIALS NEEDED  
Flip chart and marker  
 C) 
Page 19:
 
18 
  SAY : 
There can be a lot of different barriers that make it difficult for 
women to obtain MGNREGA assets that could really help their 
lives and improve their livelihoods.  
 
A barrier  is something that makes it difficult for someone to 
achieve their goal.  
 
I’m going to make a chart here of some of the different 
barriers that women in the film identified and the strategies 
that they used to overcome those barriers during the 
participatory process of demanding a MNREGA asset. Then, 
I’d like you to think about other barriers that you see that 
women like you face to achieving the goal of demanding  a 
MGNREGA asset, and your ideas about strategies  that could 
be used to overcome those barriers.  
 
 
 ASK : 
What barriers did you hear women discussing in the film? 
What barriers do you think are the greatest to women 
requesting an asset? Have you or anyone you know faced the 
same or similar barriers? What other barriers might there be?  
 
 
*Each chart should reflect the specific barrier and strategies identified by the 
women in the training session. Here is an example chart to show how this could 
be done. If women are struggling to come up with ideas, you could use some of 
the examples below  to prompt discussion.  The facilitator should be the one 
holding the pen and writing up the ideas to fill in the chart as the women offer 
their ideas.  
 
Barriers  Strategies  
- E.g., It can be difficult to speak up 
in a public setting  - E.g., I can practice beforehand 
with my neighbors, my husband, 
and other community members 
and gain their support before a 
meeting  
- E.g., My husband will not agree 
with the asset that I would like to 
recommend  - E.g., We can discuss our 
preferences beforehand , and 
maybe I will be surprised at his 
Page 20:
 
19 
 reaction. He may also keep my 
idea in mind for the future  
- E.g., I can discuss my asset 
preferences with a women’s self -
help group and find other women 
to make a project 
recommendation with  me 
- E.g., Men already know what is 
right for us, so I do not need to 
speak  - There are some things that 
women want that men care about 
a bit less (e.g., soak pits, toilets, 
fruit tree plantations, fodder 
cultivation for fuel, and 
nutri gardens ), and speaking up 
can help them be recognized as 
valuable assets to women  
- E.g., I’m really not sure what type 
of project I would even 
recommend  - I can speak to the MGNREGA 
functionary or other people I 
know about my ideas beforehand  
- E.g., I’m so busy with housework 
and childcare that I cannot find 
the time to do this  - E.g., I can join up with other 
women who can help develop a 
proposal with me  
- E.g. I am not allowed to attend 
either the palli sabha or gram 
sabha  - I can approach ward members 
with my request or persuade 
others  (such as members of my 
self-help group, friends)  to place 
my demand in the palli sabha  
- E.g., I feel that there is no point 
even asking for an asset since 
nobody listens to women anyway  - Even if nobody tends to listen 
now, I can still speak up and help 
normalize women speaking up 
and feel good about that

 SOCIAL MAPPING 
ACTIVITY  
 
 
*Allow 20-30 minutes to complete .  
 
OBJECTIVE  
A social map provides a bird’s eye view of a community, illustrating where social 
infrastructure is located in a community in relation to where people live and work. The 
purpose of this specific social map is to think about the assets that could be built 
through the MGNREGA program on a very localized map of where the participant 
lives. It should focus on the area around the participant’s home and include things like 
their own home, neighbors’ homes, roads or paths, irrigation -related infrastructure, 
produc tive farmland, pasture -land, fallow or waste land, and drainage and 
groundwater -related infrastructure. Because of the detailed categories, it is essential 
to focus on a very small geographic area nearby the homes of participating  women 
only . Relevant MGNREGA -eligible assets for consideration are listed in the table 
below. Please prevent women from trying to map the entire village or a large 
geographic area. The objective is to really zoom in nearby to their homes to help 
them think about what MGNREGA assets could be useful to them.  
The objective of creating the map is to help women think about ‘gaps’ that exist near 
their homes where an asset allowable through the MGNREGA program could be 
useful to them. To think about overcoming barriers  to women influencing the asset 
construction process, it is first important for them to think about what assets could be 
constructed, which they have already, and what would be most useful to them.   
 
BACKGROUND  
Type of asset  Examples  
Irrigation -related 
works  Digging wells, farm ponds, other water harvesting 
structures; micro irrigation canals  
Drainage and 
groundwater repair  Drainage in water -logged areas; Desilting old tanks / 
ponds, old canals, or traditional open wells  D)

MATERIALS NEEDED  
Flip chart and marker  
 
 ACTIVITY : 
• Explain the purpose of the exercise to the women and 
how it can be useful to them to think through what 
additional assets they might request to make their lives 
easier and their land more productive . 
• Using a flipchart and markers or other suitable drawing 
tools, ask the participants to identify north, south, east, 
and west. Then, start placing their homes on the map 
along with any canals, roads, or paths. If there is 
prominent communal infrastructure i n this immediate  
geographic area like schools, health clinics, drinking 
water sources, or religious buildings, these should be 
added as well.  This map should not cover the whole 
village – just the areas very near to the participants’ 
homes.  
• Once the primary buildings have been identified, start 
talking about the land in between the buildings. Which 
areas are productive farmlands? Which areas may be 
fallow? Is there irrigation -related infrastructure around? 
Infrastructure to address groundwater or drainage 
issues? Where are existing wells, ponds, shelters, and 
other facilities?

Aquatic foods are vital for the livelihoods, food and 
nutrition security of more than 800 million people in 
developing countries. They are especially important 
to countries and regions (such as islands) particularly 
vulnerable to climate change, poverty, conflict 
and humanitarian emergencies. Over and above 
that, aquatic foods harvested or grown in water are 
important for global food security, poverty alleviation 
and economic development. They are a rich source 
of vitamins, minerals and healthy fats, and therefore 
central for nutrition for children, pregnant women 
and people whose health is immunocompromised. 
More than three billion people obtain 20 percent of 
their animal protein from aquatic foods, and 60 million 
people are engaged in fisheries and aquaculture. 
Aquatic food systems are highly dynamic, comprising 
a complex web of all the elements and activities which 
relate to foods from water, along with sectors of the 
broader economic, social, political, geographical and 
natural environments in which they are embedded.
The Lake Victoria fishery currently supports 
more than 200,000 fishers (Lake Victoria Fisheries 
Organization [LVFO], 2014), with an estimated 35 
million people dependent directly or indirectly on it 
for a living (Weston, 2015). The Lake Victoria fisheries 
contribution to the GDP in terms of food, income, 
employment, and foreign exchange earnings is 
0.8% in Kenya (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 
[KNBS], 2022). The fishery resources of Lake Victoria 
are contributing enormously to the livelihood of the 
communities and the riparian states in terms of food 
security, employment, wealth generation, foreign 
earnings, and other multiplier effects. The Kenyan side 
of the lake accounts for over 69% of the total national 
freshwater fish production (KNBS, 2022). The earnings 
from the lake fisheries are a major contributor to 
economic growth around the riparian counties. The Lake Victoria fisheries has undergone some of 
the most intense ecological disturbances ever seen 
in a big freshwater ecosystem, attributed to both 
climatic and non-climatic pressures (Kolding et al., 
2014; Njiru et al., 2018). The Lake Victoria region faces 
a very serious challenge because of climate change. 
It is anticipated that it will pose a threat to the Nile 
perch fishery, deteriorate the condition of the lake’s 
environment, compromise food security, pro¬mote 
waterborne illnesses, and worsen eutrophication 
(Johnson, 2010). Climate change has had a negative 
impact on Lake Victoria fisheries and fishery-
dependent livelihoods. As a result, communities who 
depend on fishing have limited access to necessities 
like food and money. The restricted options available 
to the communities make this problem worse by 
restricting their options for survival (Baki et al., 2015). 
The effects of climate change on fisheries at the 
local levels are still not widely studied. Investigating 
how climatic variability and change affect fishing 
com¬munities and households may be helpful 
in identifying and describing counterproductive 
actions.
Thus, WorldFish carried out a scoping study from 
March to July, 2023 to assess through a gender lens-
how climate change affects the fishing communities 
in two riparian counties, specifically in Homa bay and 
Migori counties, which are located along Kenya’s Lake 
Victoria Zone Region. Owing to high poverty, the two 
counties are hotspots of community vulnerability to 
climate change. The purpose of the Climate change, 
Gender and Livelihoods Among Fisher communities in 
the Lake Victoria Zone Region in Kenya Multi-stakeholder 
Workshop  then was two folds: (i) to validate the 
findings of a scoping study; and (ii) recommending 
interventions and measures that can contribute to 
strengthening adaptation and resilience among 
women, youth, men and marginalized individuals 
among the fisher communities in the two counties.Executive summary

Attending were 42 participants (31% women) 
comprising researchers (including Kenya Marine 
Fisheries Research Institute), representatives of the 
national and county governments (including the 
Kenyan Meteorological Services staff ), local fishing 
communities, non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) operating in the fisheries sector and a 
journalist (see Annex 1 for a full list of participants). 
Presenters shared ideas and experiences on the 
impacts of climate change on the fishers and other 
fish value chain actors, which generated discussion. 
Discussions revealed that the fish value chain 
actors, suffer severe impact by climate change, as 
indicated by declining fish populations in the lake. 
This diminishing results in low and inconsistent fish 
catches, tremendous postharvest losses caused by 
rainfall and temperature variability, destruction of fish 
landing areas – including businesses and livelihoods 
along the shores of the lake – caused by floods or 
high tides that overrun the lake’s high watermark, 
increased air pollution and waterborne diseases, and 
livelihood disruptions. This forces households that are 
engaged in the fish value chain to find alternative 
sources of income, some of which destroy the 
environment.
From the workshop deliberations, five major 
recommendations emerged. First, governance of 
fisheries resources requires: (i) the formulation and 
enforcement of appropriate policies with a gender 
focus, (ii) development of regulations, laws and 
policies to govern water bodies within Kenya and the 
neighbouring countries, as well as cage fish farming, and (iii)empowering beach management units with 
financial and knowledge resources to aid them to 
promote adherence and enforcement of responsible 
use of fisheries resources. Second, addressing 
technology and fish value addition needs, through 
developing links with industry experts to help 
identify, test and implement affordable climate-smart 
technologies. Third, addressing financial bottlenecks, 
through linking key actors in the value chain with 
potential funding sources. Fourth, education and 
awareness, specifically through facilitating access 
to information and knowledge on climate change, 
markets, available technologies and financing options 
for actors in the fish value chains. Fifth is addressing 
health matters, through improving health and 
hygiene for safety and food handling, and adopting 
climate-smart drying technologies for omena and 
fulu for better hygiene and food safety).
The outcomes and outputs of the workshop were 
as follows:(i) site-specific awareness of gaps and 
planning of next-phase interventions; (ii) establishing 
commitments from the key government ministries, 
county departments and various organizations and 
fisheries value chain actors; and (iii) rallying the various 
stakeholders, fostering dialogue and networking, and 
enhancing partnerships and collaborations.

Globally, fisheries are crucial for supplying food and 
nutrition security (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change [IPCC], 2018). The fishery resources of Lake Victoria 
enormously contribute to riparian livelihoods in terms of 
food security, employment, wealth generation, foreign 
exchange earnings and other multiplier effects. At the 
national level, Kenya’s fisheries contribute 0.8% to the 
country’s gross domestic product (GDP). This is significantly 
below its considerable potential which – if realized – would 
spur tremendous economic and social growth (Munguti et 
al. 2021; Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) 2022). The 
primary contributor to the nation’s fish production systems 
is capture fisheries. According to estimates, Kenya’s inland 
waters have a fisheries potential of between 150,000 and 
300,000 metric tons (MT), primarily from commercial fishing 
(Munguti et al. 2021). Total fish production grew to 163,600 
tons in 2021, up from 151,300 tons in 2020. Freshwater fish 
landings increased by 8.5% to 136,300 tons in 2021. The 
production of marine fish also grew, reaching 27,300 tons 
in 2021 – an increase of 6.2% from the 2020 production 
levels.  The increase was ascribed to the continuation of 
sustainable and optimal utilization of fishery resources 
through the imposition of stronger regulations on fishing 
practices during breeding seasons. Fish landings brought 
in a total of 30.4 billion Kenyan shillings (KES) in 2021, up 
from KES 26.2 billion in 2020. Rising from KES 20.6 billion in 
2020 to KES 23.3 billion in 2021, earnings from freshwater 
fish landings increased, making up 76.8% of the total value 
of fish landed. With an output of 94,348 MT in 2021, Lake 
Victoria is the main producer of fish, accounting for 69% 
of the nation’s total freshwater fish production, including 
aquaculture production (KNBS, 2022).
However, climate change has had a negative impact on 
Lake Victoria fisheries and fishery-dependent livelihoods. As 
a result, communities that depend on fishing have limited 
access to necessities like food and money, worsened by 
limited options for survival (Baki et al. 2015). The effects of 
climate change on fisheries at the local levels are still not 
widely studied. Investigating how climatic variability and 
change affect fishing communities and households would 
help identify, describe and understand counterproductive 
actions in mitigation. Despite the significance of fisheries, 
little is known on local-level climate-change driven 
vulnerability of fishery-dependent livelihoods. Most 
research has concentrated on the impact of climate 
change on fisheries at global, regional and country scales. 
Furthermore, there has been relatively limited in-depth 
analysis of the gender dimensions of climate change in

Consequently, WorldFish commissioned a scoping 
study to assess how climate change affects the 
fishing communities in two riparian counties along 
Kenya’s Lake Victoria – Migori and Homa Bay counties. 
Owing to the high poverty rates, both counties 
are hotspots of climate-change driven community 
vulnerability. Thus, WorldFish together with the 
Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) organized a 
two-day workshop (25th–26th September 2023) on 
Climate change, gender and livelihoods in Migori and 
Homa Bay. The workshop had three objectives, which 
are: (i) to disseminate the findings of the scoping 
study on determining the impacts of climate change 
on fishing communities in the two counties; (ii) 
identify choke-points in the fish value chains; and 
(iii) recommend interventions and measures that 
can contribute to strengthening adaptation and 
resilience to climate-change impacts in fisheries in 
the study area. 
The workshop brought together 42 key stakeholders, 
including researchers, representatives from the 
national and county governments, local fishing 
communities, NGOs operating in fisheries and a 
journalist (see Annex 1 for the list of participants and 
Annex 2 for the workshop agenda).To maximize input from all participants, sessions 
were a mix of plenary presentations, group breakout 
sessions and discussion panels. The workshop had 
five components, which were: (i) introduction and 
scene setting (welcome session, official opening); 
(ii) findings from scoping study on impacts of 
climate change on the livelihoods of the fishing 
communities in Migori and Homa Bay counties, and 
plenary discussions; (iii) Group breakout sessions 
on adaptation and resilience to the impacts of 
climate change in the fisheries sector in Migori and 
Homa Bay counties; (iv) Presentations on climate-
smart technologies in the fisheries value chain; fish 
value addition and other fish value chain activities 
in East Africa; panel discussion on reflections and 
recommendations; and (v) Recommendations for 
actions and closing remarks.
Moreover, the workshop covered five thematic areas, 
which are: (i) governance of fisheries resources, (ii) 
technology and value addition, (iii) financing, (iv) 
education and awareness, and (v) health. This report 
then presents highlights, activities and insights from 
the workshop.

Before presenting workshop objectives, Dr. Rahma 
Adam first gave an extensive overview – backed 
by the latest data – of WorldFish. Specifically, she 
provided information on what the organization 
does, its contribution to the world over the years as 
well as successes. WorldFish is one of 13 institutions 
under One CGIAR – a global partnership that unites 
international organizations engaged in research on 
food systems. It works in the global south, specifically 
Africa, Asia and the Pacific. 
While stating ‘big facts’ about aquatic food, she 
noted that globally, 3.3 billion people depend on 
aquatic foods, with genetically improved tilapia 
being introduced in the aquatic foods system. 
She highlighted the importance of leveraging on 
partnerships and noted that WorldFish’s mission is to 
end hunger, and to advance sustainable development 
by 2030 through science and innovation to transform 
food, land and water systems with aquatic foods for a healthier planet and people. WorldFish’s vision is to 
realize an inclusive world of healthy, well-nourished 
people and a sustainable blue planet, now and in the 
future. She mentioned that this is why the workshop 
aims to review the impacts of climate change on 
livelihoods and identify priority actions for enhancing 
the resilience of the vulnerable fisher communities 
to climate change, including women and youth in 
Homa Bay and Migori. The workshop’s aim was to 
present findings from a scoping study on the impacts 
of climate change on fishery-dependent livelihoods 
in the two counties. It was also a validation workshop 
for the scoping study. Findings from the study sought 
answers to the following questions: (i) What are the 
choke-points in the fishing value chains in Homa Bay 
and Migori?; and (ii) What can be done to address the 
bottlenecks in the fisheries sector along Lake Victoria 
Zone Region in the midst of climate change? 2.1.1. Placing

Dr Philip Osano gave a background, overview and 
history of the Stockholm Environmental Institute 
(SEI) – an international non-profit research and 
policy organization that tackles environment and 
development challenges. SEI’s strategic policy 
engagement prioritizes 2030 Agenda and SDGs, 
climate governance, financing for sustainable 
development, biodiversity, ecosystems and 
oceans. This means that SEI connects science 
and decision-making to formulate solutions for a 
sustainable future for all. The institute’s work spans 
climate, water, air and land-use issues, governance, 
the economy, gender and health. Stakeholder 
involvement is at the heart of SEI’s efforts to build 
capacity, strengthen institutions and equip partners 
for long-term change. SEI promotes debate and 
knowledge-sharing for and among decision-makers, 
academics and practitioners; and engagement with 
policy processes, development action and business 
practice worldwide.SEI currently (2023) has ongoing work in Migori and 
Homa Bay counties on climate change and fisheries. 
They conducted a scoping study on Lake Victoria’s 
rising water levels. Conclusions from this workshop 
will feed into the next SEI strategy. Of note, the blue 
economy is more than fisheries alone.
The 6th assessment report of IPCC focused on impacts, 
adaptation and vulnerability, noting that climate-
change impacts and risks are becoming increasingly 
complex and more difficult to manage.
Multiple climate hazards will occur simultaneously, 
and multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will 
interact, resulting in compounding overall risk, and 
in risks cascading across sectors and regions. And 
although different regions have different priorities, 
the workshop’s deliberations are vital, and will have 
cascading impact on other countries and counties.Dr. Philip Osano,

Mr. George Okoth, the Chief Fisheries Officer of 
Homa Bay county, reported that Homa Bay County 
is currently living through a climate crisis, which he 
described as ‘turbulent times’ whose signs are very 
clear. Homa Bay has two main physical features – the 
lakeside lowlands and the upland plateau. The county 
has the largest share of the Kenyan waters of Lake 
Victoria, 16 islands with unique fauna and fora and 
an impressive array of highly aesthetic physiographic 
features. Several rivers drain into Lake Victoria, most 
of which originate from the surrounding highlands. 
They include Awach Kibuon, Awach Tende, Maugo, 
Kuja, Rangwe and Riana rivers. In the 2019 census, the 
Homabay county’s population was about 1,131,950 
people of whom the majority were youth, with 40% 
below 15 years. The county’s population density is 
about 359.1 persons per square kilometer.
With detailed data, a picture was painted on how 
greatly the climate crisis has devastated the lives of 
the fisherfolks, to a point that they have now resorted 
to sand harvesting despite knowing how disastrous 
it is to biodiversity. Sand harvesting has spread to 
Rusinga and Mfangano Islands.
However, the Homa Bay county government is 
currently working on a policy to ‘mainstream’ sand harvesting – currently an illegal activity – as part of 
wider mineral harvesting. Sand is core raw material 
in construction. Banning it will have ripple effects, as 
it is also a source of livelihood despite its negative 
environmental and economic impacts. Streamlining 
is a better approach and experts are working on 
the best way of harvesting without destroying the 
environment. 
Homa Bay county recently launched a five-point El 
Niño preparedness plan. The five areas are as follows: 
i. Pre-identifying value chains likely to be affected 
by El Niño (sorghum, chicken and fish);
ii. Improving weather advisory messages to help 
farmers, e.g. reinforcement of dikes, water 
monitoring, dissemination of information to 
fishermen, health department to be part of the 
team on climate change;
iii. Public awareness that climate change is real;
iv. Even if El Niño doesn’t come, the improvements 
made in preparedness are sound and of benefit; 
and
v. Research and partnership are key: no 
interventions in isolation.

Mr. George Ochola, Migori County Chief Officer for 
Fisheries and Blue Economy, welcomed participants 
to the county. Migori County takes climate change 
seriously, with a special committee on climate change 
issues. The impacts of the climate crisis, particularly 
in Nyatike sub-county, are dire. Water has destroyed 
all landing areas along territories run by beach 
management units (BMUs). Fish population is so 
depleted that fishermen often return empty handed. 
The workshop is very important and the study will 
help the country to find solutions for communities 
whose livelihoods depend on fisheries.
Lakeside aquaculture business is adversely affected 
when floods from the hinterland wash equipment 
and soil into the water. Therefore, hinterland 
residents must be sensitized to institute flooding 
measures. Farmers in the region acknowledge that 
cage fish farming is the solution. However, setting 
up cages is very expensive. The county government 
is fully cognizant of this and in fact provided cages 
to only seven of the county’s 30 BMUs. They lack the 
resources to provide fingerlings and feed. Likewise, 
the county government has limited resources to help 
fisherfolk mitigate and adapt to the challenges of the 
climate crisis.Migori County recently formed a committee in 
line with El Niño preparedness following Kenya’s 
Meteorological Department predictions. Besides El 
Niño, above average rainfall is expected this year, also 
driven by the Indian Ocean Dipole – a natural climate 
cycle brought about by sustained changes in the 
difference between sea surface temperatures in the 
tropical western and eastern Indian Ocean, adjacent 
to the East African coast and south of Indonesia.
Enforcing fishing governance is challenging, but 
has been achieved in Tanzania. It requires close 
liaison between regional and national governments 
because the lake belongs to the national government 
while fishing falls under the county government. This 
split creates a gray area in implementing governance 
policies. The Lakefront Development Authority being 
formed will bring together all counties that touch 
Lake Victoria, including Busia, Siaya and Kisumu.2.1.5 Impacts of

Mr. Samson Kidera, the Western and Nyanza 
Regional Coordinator for Blue Economy and Fishers, 
represented the Chief Guest, Ms. Betsy Muthoni Njagi, 
the Permanent Secretary for Blue Economy. The State 
Department is sensitizing women to ensure good 
practices are achieved. He lauded continued efforts 
and initiatives by WorldFish in doing the same. 
Sensitization is important to ensure good practices 
are achieved. This workshop is important because: (i) 
policy documents provide conducive environment 
and are developed through such forums; and (ii) 
research and extension are critical in ensuring that 
answers to our challenges are found. Results of the 
scoping study will provide some of the solutions for 
resilience to climate change.
The national government through the State 
Department for Fisheries, Aquaculture and the Blue 
Economy has the mandate to facilitate sustainable 
development and management of aquatic resources. 
This is why the government hopes the scoping study 
will provide sound recommendation on investment in Lake Victoria that will help achieve Kenya’s mission 
and vision.
Aquaculture is a part of the blue economy and 
supports 1.2 million people. The sector can deliver 
more, which is why the government is developing 
new methods to achieve the true reality/expected 
GDP contribution. Lake Victoria accounts for 98% 
of the fishing industry. With 44% of all landing sites 
according to a study done in 2020, Homa Bay has 
the highest contribution, but has less developed 
landing sites. During last year’s largest global climate 
conference (COP-27), emissions from fisheries 
were recognized as contributors to greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions and therefore contributing 
to climate change. This is why the government is 
supporting appropriate technologies including 
solar driers, and believes that there are windows for 
funding adaptation. Workshop recommendations 
will therefore be vital in helping shape policy 
development.2.2 Keynote address by Western and Nyanza

The Constitution of Kenya recognizes the role of 
community through establishment of the BMUs 
to ensure best services. Women play major roles in 
fisheries – both negative and positive. Postharvest 
processing contributes to GDP . But buying and selling 
immature fish caught using illegal methods and gear 
has negative impacts. Sensitization by WorldFish and 
others is important to ensure good practice.
Some of the impacts of climate change are: (i) 
displacement of fisherfolks from their landing sites; 
(ii) October 2022 to March 2023 –Climate change 
resulted in temperature rise. Lake Victoria temperature 
went as high as 29˚C, which destabilized the water 
habitat; and (iii) cage farming as one of the blue 
economy initiatives suffered a loss of approximately 
KES 1 billion.These could be addressed by initiatives carried out by 
the CGIAR research systems, and therefore the forum 
is fundamental to the government. In February 
2023, a fisheries policy was adopted and presented 
to parliament after cabinet discussions. The policy 
will support growth and inclusivity (gender equality, 
social inclusion and youth). Youth have energy and 
mental capacity to drive the blue economy.
The government also recognizes the participation 
of women in fisheries. Recommendations should 
have inclusivity at all levels, from reporting and 
implementation to development of adaptive 
strategies. Omena,  Nile perch and tilapia are the main 
species within the lake region. Postharvest losses 
are highest for omena  which involves women, and 
therefore women should be supported.

Fish for jobs
From: De Graaf, G., & Garibaldi, L. (2015). The value of African fisheries. FAO fisheries and aquaculture circular, (C1093), I.
Conservative estimate for Africa: 6.4 million jobs mostly in the small-scale segment  (Source: de Graaf, G. & Garibaldi, L.2014). 10% of the globe derives its livelihood from fisheries. 
Jobs for women: very conservative estimate, it is 28% of the work force
From: Chan CY, Tran N, Cheong KC, Sulser TB, Cohen PJ, Wiebe K, et al. (2021) The future of fish in Africa: Employment and investment opportunities. PLoS ONE 16(12): e0261615.
Africa’s fish sector is estimated to support 20.7 million jobs in 2030, and 21.6 million by 2050 under the BAU.
Approximately 2.6 people will be employed indirectly along fisheries and aquaculture value chains for every person directly employed in the fish production stage. 
Under the HIGH scenario, total employment in Africa’s fish food system will reach 58.0 million jobs, representing 2.4% of total projected population in Africa by 2050.

Higher temperatures, beyond tolerance levels, could increase mortality for some fish species.
Changes in temperature increase bacterial, parasitic, viral and fungal diseases (Maulu et al. 2021), so fish could become more susceptible to these diseases as temperatures rise. Higher temperatures could also lead to the emergence of epizootic diseases. 
Changes in temperature could increase algae blooms, which can be toxic to fish, resulting in poor growth and underperformance. 
Heavy rainfall and flooding is a production risk in low lying areas. This can damage ponds and lead to fish escaping from ponds, and unwanted fish species invading ponds. A flooding event on a fish farm can easily introduce an invasive fish species into the wild.
Changes in rainfall patterns affect water availability, ranging from droughts and shortages to floods, thereby reducing water quality for aquaculture. Increased run-off could bring in nutrients from agricultural fertilizers and cause algal blooms. This would lead to reduced levels of dissolved oxygen, which can be lethal to fish (Plate 1). Rising temperatures also reduce the level of dissolved oxygen, with similar results.
Direct impacts of climate change on aquaculture 
Development of excessive algae bloom, which is harmful to fish in Mporokoso District, Zambia because of greater inflow of nutrients, in the 2021-2022.
 Broken pond walls and fingerling holding tanks in Luwingu District, Zambia because of excess water from the rains.
Slide 10:
Responding to change
Adaptation entails changes in “processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential damages or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate change” (UNFCCC, nd). Adaptation promotes actions and solutions to address current and future climate change impacts. Cultivating improved fish breeds that are resilient to climate change is one example.

Example: Applying IAA systems as a climate smart aquaculture technology 
Pigs can also be integrated with fish farming. The photo shows direct integration of pigs and fish. The system uses pipes to wash pig droppings directly into the fishpond. Direct integration of fish and pigs at Hopeways in Mansa District.
IAA is a key livelihood strategy for smallholder farmers to diversify their income, spread the risk, stabilize production and increase resource efficiency.
It conserves the environment since because it uses small amounts of land to produce.
Multiple uses of water and land make the overall system more stable and resilient than using water and land for one single purpose.
It uses an ecosystem-based management approach because of interconnected interactions within an ecosystem, e.g., rice-fish integration, where nutrient-rich water from fish waste fertilizes rice plants in the same aquatic system.
Reduces the aquaculture sector’s vulnerability and in increasing its resilience to climate change. 
It allows double cropping, leading to diversification and improved incomes and rural livelihoods.

 Executive Summary  
 
The One CGIAR Harnessing Gender and Social Equality for Resilience in Agrifood Systems 
(HER+) Initiative hosted a workshop in Nigeria for stakeholders in the cassava, catfish, and 
chicken value chains between November 10 – 11, 2022, at the International In stitute of 
Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria. The workshop's main objectives were to: i) identify and 
map the key stakeholders in the catfish, cassava, and chicken value chains; and ii) 
understand which norms constrain women and other groups from parti cipating in and 
benefiting from work in the different nodes of the value chain. Seventeen (17) stakeholders 
(8 men and 9 women) from the Academia, Non -Governmental Organizations (NGOs), 
Government Departments, private sector, producer organizations and oth er value chain 
actors with a national/ regional perspective of the value chains of interest participated in the 
workshop.  
Adopting a participatory approach that engendered mutual interaction and learning, 
discussion with the different actors across the three value chains was facilitated by the 
application of three main tools: Tool 1: Background information on climate change i mpacts 
on the Value Chain of interest; Tool 2: Mapping of value chains Adapted from Linda, Mayoux 
and Terrilon; and Tool 3: Actor Analysis Tool. Tool 1 elicited information about how critical 
events, including climate change -related events, affected the va lue chains during the past 
ten years. Tool 2 was applied to map the value chain actors involved in the value chain from 
a gender perspective, while Tool 3, the Actor Analysis tool, was used to profile the various 
chain supporters in the cassava, catfish,  and chicken value chains.  
Stakeholders across the three value chains reported significant climate -related events that 
affected men and women actors. These include flash floods, irregular rainfall, and drought; 
These events negatively impact value chain activities, thereby affecting  the performance 
and livelihood of women and men value chain actors. However, stakeholders agreed that 
women value chain actors are usually disproportionately affected due to their poor financial 
status, limited access to productive assets, and prevalence of restrictive norms that place 
them at a disadvantageous position. Nevertheless, for both women's and men's conditions, 
climate change challenges are worsened by the impact of Covid 19, increasing inflation, 
changes in Government policy and incessant inse curity prevalent in the country.  
Non-climate -related events affecting actors across the three value chains include – the 
inconsistent market for produce and products, a delay in the disbursement of government 
credit and loans to farmers, and inadequate extension and advisory service. 
Notw ithstanding, stakeholders highlighted some events that have positively impacted the 
activities of women and men in the three value chain. For instance, the implementation of 
different in itiatives, for example, HarvestP lus, BASICS, and NextGen, the emergenc e of 
young entrepreneurs and the deployment of ICT and other improved technologies are 
positively impacting the activities of women and men in the cassava value chain. In the 
catfish value chain, improved research and development activities introduced impr oved 
technologies and innovations such as water parameter testing and alternative fish feed. 
Different actors operate at the various nodes of the value chain along the production, 
processing and marketing nodes. However, marked gender differences exist in the 
participation along the nodes, with men concentrating on production.  
Page 4:
 
4 
 In contrast, women concentrate on the processing nodes, especially in the cassava and 
catfish value chains. Also, women are the main actors in the trading and marketing node for 
the catfish value chain. Value chain supporters such as cassava grower associa tions; 
politicians; traditional leaders; landowners; agro -dealers; village processing units; 
aggregators/bulkers; fabricators; government through agriculture development programmes 
(ADPs); research institutions like IITA supporting women and men in the cas sava value 
chain have contributed to enhancing the different activities under the cassava value chain. 
For the catfish value chain, chain supporters include aquaculture farmer associations, 
extension services, transporters, ice sellers, technicians and art isans, researchers, 
veterinary/lab services providers, finance providers and information services providers.  
Across the three value chains, stakeholders confirm the prevalence of gender norms that 
shape women’s  access to resources, participation in decision -making, participation in 
leadership, access to credit and loans, adoption and use of technology/equipment and 
mobility. These norms reinforce existing bias and discrimination towards women. Men are 
the primar y decision -makers at the household level and dictate what women can and cannot 
do. Men also have more access to finances than women such that in case of a setback, it is 
easier for them to return or pump more capital into business than their women counterparts.  
 
In conclusion, the stakeholders’  workshop provided insights into climate -related events 
and how these affect women and men in the three value chain of interest. Also, details 
were provided on actors in each node, their role, norms that affect them, and their 
economic resilience to climat e change challenges. The workshop provided more insight 
into gender norms and associated constraints influencing men and women value chain 
actors across the three value chains in Nigeria. Key learning from the stakeholders a cross 
the three countries is that gender inequalities driven by norms that shape and reinforce 
discriminatory biases exist at different levels. Learning from the stakeholders’  workshop 
will be integrated into the HER+ study, ‘qualitative  assessment of gender norms that 
constrain women’s  economic resilience to climate change challenges . The study will be 
carried out with women and men operating at different nodes of the cassava, catfish/fish, 
and chicken value chains in Nigeria and Tanzania. The study will use a combination of 
tools – Individual Interviews, Key Informants Interviews (KI Is) and Community -Level Focus 
Group Discussions (FGDs). Thus, key learning from the stakeholders’ workshop will be 
incorporated and used to strengthen the tools.

 1. Introduction  
The HER+ Initiative is a One CGIAR Initiative seeking to address the following four 
dimensions of gender inequality in agrifood systems:  
• women’s lack of agency or limited ability to define and act on goals, make decisions 
that matter to them, and participate in the economy and public life ;  
• women’s lack of access to and control over resources ;   
• social norms that discriminate based on gender ; and   
• policies and governance that fail to include and benefit women . 
HER+ uses impactful gender research to address the four dimensions of gender inequality 
by applying gender -transformative approaches to address harmful norms. It does this by 
bundling innovations for women's empowerment, leveraging social protection to inc rease 
women's access to and control over resources, and promoting inclusive governance and 
policies for increased resilience. The HER+ Initiative will generate learning and evidence 
on levers, and entry points to disrupt the foundations of inequality in agri-food systems 
(AFSs ). It seeks to achieve this by working through 4 work packages as illustrated in figure 
1. 
 
 
Figure 1: HER+ Initiative Work Packages - Source HER+ Proposal document  
 
The stakeholders’  workshop was conducted as part of Work Package 1 TRANSFORM: 
Gender Transformative A pproaches (GTAs)  which seeks  to reduce the  normative 
constraints that limit women's economic resilience to climate change ( CC) challenges.  
 
Specifically, the WP1 will seek to achieve the following:  
• In the 2022 –2024 cycle, WP1 will help AFS stakeholders identify leverage points 
and levers to reduce normative constraints that limit women’s capacities to build 
economic resilience to CC challenges.  
• The One CGIAR and partners will use the evidence to design and implement GTAs  
with CGIAR Initiatives and partners to overcome these constraints.  
• WP1 will help harness and package the learning to accelerate the widespread

 application of GTAs within the AR4D ecosystem.  
 
This report focuses on a workshop with stakeholders representing three value chains: 
cassava, catfish,  and chicken.   
 
1.1 Meeting Objectives   
From the 10th  to the 11th of November 2022, t he HER+ Initiative hosted a stakeholders’ 
workshop at the IITA office headquarters in Ibadan, Nigeria (See Annex 1 for workshop 
Agenda). The workshop had the following objectives.  
 
• To identify and map the key stakeholders in the catfish, cassava and chicken value 
chains  
• To understand which norms constrain women and other groups from participating in 
and benefiting from work in the different nodes of the value chain  
 
Participants in the workshop were selected from national and regional stakeholders and 
experts with knowledge of the three value chains. Stakeholders included experts ( e.g., 
University Faculty, NGO players, Government Departments), private sector actors, 
representatives of producer organizations and other value chain actors (see Annex 2 for 
the list of participants).  
 
1.2 Expected outcomes  
At the end of the workshop, the following outcomes were produced:  
1. A workshop report ;  
2. A value chain map for each of the value chains ; 
3. Characterization of stakeholders that need to be further interviewed ;  
4. Improved data collection tools ; and  
5. Gender norms t hat need further exploration were  identified for the different value 
chains.  
 
Although the workshop was structured along three tools over two days, for coherence, the 
report is structured per value chain.  
  
Page 9:

 2. Workshop Structure  
 
A participatory approach that engendered mutual interaction and learning was used as the 
overall guiding framework for the workshop. Netsayi Mudege , a Senior Social Scientist 
from WorldFish, Lusaka, Zambia  introduced the workshop by welcoming the guests and 
presenting the workshop's purpose and the tools to be used during the workshop. The 
value chain actors were then split into three value chain groups  to discuss the following 
tools:  
 
1. Tool 1: Background information on climate change impacts on the Value Chain of 
interest  
2. Tool 2:  Mapping of value chains Adapted from Linda, Mayoux and Terrilon  
3. Tool 3: Actor analysis Tool  (Source: Vanderschaeghe and Lindo, 2003) . 
 
Below we describe the purpose of each tool.  
 
2.1 Tool 1: Background information on climate change impacts 
on the value chain of interest   
This tool elicit ed information about how the different value chains have been affected by 
critical events, including climate change -related events during the past 10  years . A key 
issue during the implementation of the tool was that key stakeholders for the three value 
chains stated that although they had experienced issues like flooding and droughts, they 
did not believe climate change was indeed affecting their value chain s. The y expressed 
that poor infrastructure development and other non -climate events h ad been more 
impactful.  
 
2.2 Tool 2: Mapping of value chains  
  
The tool1  mapped value chain actors involved in the value chain from a gender 
perspective. The purpose was to map value chain actors for further engagement in 
interviews and Focus Group Discussions to understand the norms that prevent women 
value chain actors from becomin g economically resilient to climate change impacts. The 
tool helped us to understand where women and men operate across and within the 
different nodes of the value chain and why. The focus  is on the norms that enable/  
disenable women and men from engaging and benefiting from their participation in the 
Value Chain of interest.  
 
The tool used a gender lens to assess the environmental factors (physical, business, 
policy, and social) influencing women ’s participation in the selected value chains . For 
instance, if women are not present in specific nodes because they require high skill and 
are high -paying, and thus men dominate, then which norms (and power relations) create 
these outcomes? Answering these questions helped stakeholders to inform the 'norm 
statements' proposed for further exploration i n interviews and Focus Group Discuss ions 
(FGDs).

 3. Cassava Value Chain  
This sect ion presents the c assava value chain analysis findings from the three tools 
introduced in section 2.  
 
3.1 Events that have affected the wellbeing and livelihoods of 
cassava value chain actors over the past ten years   
 
Stakeholders listed the following negative impacts  affecting women and men actors along 
the different nodes of the value chain : 
 
3.1.1.  Producers  
 
1. The inconsistent implementation of the government to substitute 20% of wheat flour 
with cassava flour affected millions of cassava farmers and processors. The policy 
would have assisted millions of farmers to make more money in cassava. Some 
processing factories were set up, and the governmen t spent millions of  cash. 
However, due to the appointment of a new minister, the policy is no longer being 
implemented. Stakeholders noted that farmers made huge losses because they 
produced more cassava expecting to benefit from the policy, which was eventually 
not imple mented, causing a glut of cassava on the market and low prices.  
2. The inconsistent market for cassava produce & products ; 
3. Delay in the disbursement of government  credit/loan facilities to farmers ; 
4. Limited access to newly released climate -smart varieties and technologies such as 
drought -tolerant cassava varieties, green house for seed multiplication : 
a. Farmers have responded to this lack of climate -smart varieties by seeking 
cassava stems from those that received these varieties. Both men and 
women can access improved varieties from beneficiaries informally. 
However, because of limited mobility, women of ten access these through 
their husbands or relatives. Stakeholders stated that it is difficult for women 
(especially married women) to cover long distances from one state to 
another to seek new cassava varieties due to restrictions on their movement.  
5. Uncoordinated monitoring, evaluation and learning of activities ; 
6. Inadequate extension and advisory services ; 
7. Flash floods ;  
a. Cassava farmers have coped with flash floods by moving their cassava 
farms to another land that is not flooded. Both men and women are affected, 
but more women struggle to cope with this problem due to limited access to 
land.  
8. Irregular rainfall, which is made worse by the dependence on rainfed agriculture ; 
a. Women are more affected because they have less access to climate -smart 
agriculture technologies like irrigation systems.  
b. Cassava farmers also respond to climate -related threats such as floods and 
irregular rainfall by diversifying their enterprises. However, stakeholders 
noted that more women could diversify than men 'due to the ability of women 
to multitask and quickly perceive  the danger ahead'. Another coping 
mechanism that processors use is to close factories and engage in other 
businesses.  The stakeholders agreed that more  women close factories than 
men.  
 
Page 12:
 
12 
 3.1.2  Processors  
1. Limited access to credit  facilities  mainly affects women more than men. The 
stakeholders confirmed that a married  woman needs her husband's permission to get a 
loan from the bank .  The wife needs to use her husband's assets as collateral.  “A 
woman, most of the time can only access a loan through the husband .... A man will get 
a loan for planting of cassava. Once he gets it, he gives part of the loan amount to his 
wife. When a woman/wife get s the money, she will not use the money for planting 
cassava alone. She will diversify into other products,  and she will payback her own 
loan faster than a man  when a woman makes money,  she gives the husband … 
Husbands know that a woman will make more money so they depend on them ”.   
Female stakeholders noted that women work hard but do not have equal access to 
credit since many of them do  not have guarantors and collateral . In general, the 
stakeholders highlighted so me of the issues that exacerbate the experience of men 
and women in the cassava value chain:  
a. Stakeholders noted that producers could also get inputs on credit, but 
women fear taking such risks. It is primarily men who acquire inputs on 
credit.  
b. Inconsistent government policies, particularly on the 20% substitution of 
wheat flour with cassava flour by private companies that bake bread. Many 
processors invested in processing machines anticipating increased demand 
for cassava flour, but the policy was not implemented. They suffered huge 
losses, and some processors shut down.    
2. Poor  maintenance of machines and equipment due to limited access to spare parts 
and qualified technicians . 
3. Inconsistent supply of raw materials due to long distance in sourcing cassava roots  
and high transportation cost  
4. Insecurity e.g., kidnapping. Participants mentioned that insecurity was affecting all 
farmers in the country. The insecurity made women afraid to move around, affecting 
their ability to participate and benefit from the cassava business. All participants in 
the cassava gro up agreed that although insecurity affects both men and women, 
women are more affected.  
a.  As a coping mechanism, in 2022, farmers formed and engaged local 
security agents (vigilantes) to provide security, although they felt that the 
problem of insecurity persists .  
3.1.3 Traders  
1. High energy costs leading to high transaction cost  
2. Poor infrastructure, e.g., bad roads and inadequate storage facilities  
3. Exploitation by middleperson s (mostly men) who buy cassava at meager 
unsustainable prices  
 
 
3.1.4 Positive events  
The s takeholders also highlighted  the following positive events  for women and men in the 
cassava value chain :  
 
1. Interventions through project initiatives  for example, TAAT, Harvestplus, CAVA, 
WEEDMN, BASICS, NextGen, which led to the introduction of new varieties of 
cassava, managed to link farmers to markets enabling them to upgrade to 
commercial farming and more women being cassava producers.  
2. CAVA, and TAAT trained processors to use high -quality cassava farming (HQCF) in 
bread and confectionaries processing. Projects such as VCDP/IFAD also trained 
Page 13:
 
13 
 other primary processors on good processing practices and quality management 
systems (QMS)  
3. Some stakeholders mentioned that there had been evidence of the transition from 
making traditional products such as gari and fufu to the production of commercial 
and industrial products such as starch, ethanol, and high -quality cassava pe el. This 
has encouraged some farmers to move from subsistence production to commercial 
production of cassava because of readily available lucrative cassava markets 
provided by offtakers. It was suggested that although tradition ally, women had 
dominated cassava processing, m ore women are also moving into cassava 
production.  
 
4. Nigeria fabricators are exporting cassava technologies ( e.g. flash dryers) to other 
African countries like Tanzania, Malawi, Uganda etc.  
5. The emergence of y oung entre preneurs in haulage/aggregation and other 
marketing businesses  
6. Deployment of ICT  and improvement s in the use of technology  in cassava value 
chain activities.  
 
3.2 Cassava value chain mapping   
This section presents the outcome of the cassava value chain mapping  exercise . It also 
provides insights into some of the constraints that women and men value chain actors 
experience in their participation at the different nodes of the value chain.  
The following stakeholders were identified during the workshop: cassava grower 
association; politicians; traditional leaders ; landowners; agro -dealers; village processing 
units; aggregators/bulkers; fabricators; government through agriculture development 
programmes (ADPs); research institutions like IITA, HarvestP lus; Universities such as the 
Federal University of Agriculture Abeokut a (FUNAAB), GOSEED and Information 
Communication and  Technology (ICT) digital application developers. These stakeholders 
have contributed to enhancing the different activities under the cassava value chain such as 
developing improved cassava varieties, training processors on producing value -added 
cassava products , providing access to agro -chemicals and equipment , as well as 
undertaking research on new cassava varieties .  
Input providers : Patriarchal norms are predominant in Nigeria; hence  men, not women, 
inherit the land from their parents.  
 
Similarly, m en have more access to resources than women. For example,  men have more 
access to inputs such as herbicides , pesticides etc . Herbicides are expensive so only 
farmers with money and access to credit can easily access them. Men can easily access 
credit because they have collateral, and even lending institutions prefer giving  credit to  a 
man over a married woman because they are not comfortable talking to married women in 
the absence of their husbands.  
 
""Can you imagine you find your wife negotiating credit repayment with another man 
or has failed to pay back? What would you think of as a husband if it was you? The 
story would change from credit to something else....it will be like what are you doing 
with my wife""?  
 
""Men love to deal with men when selling on credit. This is because when the time for 
payment comes, the issue can be misconstrued; the husband's brother or the 
Page 14:
 
14 
 husband himself can accuse a man of having a sexual relationship or trying to 
embarrass someone's wife so the lender can even lose ev erything in such cases"".
  
 
Herbicides application - It was also noted that men handle herbicides application because 
they are toxic chemicals if not handled properly. Women cannot manage to handle them, 
and it is preferred that they do not handle them to protect the children they care for. Because 
of these reasons, when it comes to offering credit or loans, men prefer dealing with other 
men rather than women.  
 
Land clearing  – Stakeholders suggested that because it requires much energy, men are 
responsible for clearing the land.  
  
Planting - The s takeholders said that women are better at planting cassava because they 
follow good agronomic practices than men who tend to be impatient . For this reason, farmers 
usually engage women in planting cassava.  
""cassava planting is a light job needing less energy, so women like it. They do better 
in this because they have patience. Women follow the recommended spacing for 
planting cassava. If you ask men to do it, they want to finish fast. They will heap /plant 
all the cassava stems in one place. As a result, farmers prefer that women plant 
cassava"".  
A female stakeholder explained that ""men don ’t know how to plant cassava; it is a job for 
women"".  
  
Sourcing for Cassava stems - Men can travel at any time to source stem cuttings and do 
not need permission from anyone. Men need to monitor the cuttings of the stem to ensure 
they are properly cut (standard cutting). Men can easily frustrate a woman because most 
women are not assert ive.  
 
""Can you imagine a woman going to the farm in the bush in the middle of men? First, 
if she just tries to tell a man how she wants her stem to be cut before she even 
finishes talking, the man will look at her and ask, 'who are you to tell me how to cut 
stems? I have been cutting stems for 15 years, so what can you tell me? Where are 
you coming from; don’t  you have a husband?""  
 
It is also risky for a woman to go into the bush to get the stems (insecurity). A female 
stakeholder explained that :  
""Women  can't tell a man what they want, and I don’t  blame because it is a carryover 
from their homes. They are not expected to talk back at their husband, and in the 
absence of their husbands or male relatives, they are not expected to start talking to 
another man in the bush; you know cassava fields are i n the bush"".  
  
Pulverizing  - is a mechanized unit operated mainly by men because women are not allowed 
to use mechanized units due to societal expectations. It is believed to be a man's job to 
operate agricultur al equipment. A female farmer at the stakeholders' workshop explains:  
 
""Society expects that a woman cannot operate a machine because it looks 
complicated to operate …. But it is not even difficult. I have a pulverizer at home, but 
if I operate it myself, you will find that everyone who sees me will be surprised. Even 
my chil dren will say, 'mummy, why are you doing that? That is a job for men. Because 
of this, I leave it for men to operate it"",

Sieving  – This is an easy activity which is us ually done sitting. Men who perform this activity 
are considered lazy and viewed as “having nothing to do ”. A female stakeholder explained 
that sieving was easy such that even a 10 -year-old could manage it. The activity was

Executive 
Summary  
Purpose:  This report presents the findings of 
qualitative assessments conducted on 
inequitable norms that restrict women’s 
capacities to build economic resilience to 
climate change challenges in Nigeria. The 
study sought to answer the following 
question: What gend er norms prevent 
women from building economic resilience to 
climate change challenges in agrifood 
systems (AFSs), and to what extent do these 
discriminatory biases exist at different 
institutional levels?  
The study collected data on three area: (1) 
weather and climate events affecting the 
performance of the cassava, catfish, and 
chicken value chains, (2) the gender division 
of roles and duties along the different value 
chain nodes, and (3) gender norms exis ting 
at different institutional levels and how they 
interact with different identities affecting the 
adaptive capacities of men and women and 
their resilience to climate change impacts.  
Methodology:  The report is based on data 
collected through a stakeholder’s workshop 
in Nigeria, 55 individual interviews (IDIs) and 
key informant interviews (KIIs) and 18 focus 
group discussions (FGDs). Eighteen 
respondents were interviewed for each of 
the catfish and  chicken value chains, and 19 
for the cassava value chain. The study was 
conducted in Ogun State for the catfish 
value chain and in Oyo State for the chicken 
and cassava value chains. Data was collected 
on the climate shocks experienced by 
different value chain actors, their coping 
mechanisms and resilience, as well as the 
gender norms that govern these value chains 
and their implications for women’s economic resilience. A resilience approach was used to 
analyze the data from a gender perspective.   
Findings: Underlying gender and cultural 
norms influence the adaptive capacities of 
men and women and, therefore, their 
economic resilience to the impacts of climate 
change. Gender norms limit women from 
owning assets, expanding businesses or 
accessing credit. As a result, women often 
maladapt to climate change impacts by 
engaging in short -term survival strategies 
that do not consider the changes they need 
to make and the transformation they need to 
undergo to be resilient in the face of future 
climate chan ge. Gender norms, such as 
those related to the division of roles, access 
to and control of assets, mobility and so on, 
often lead to low adaptive capacities for 
women, resulting in less resilience. However, 
norms are increasingly being challenged, 
and both  men and women question them, 
with women starting to own property and 
other assets. At the same time, men are also 
engaging in value chain activities previously 
regarded as women’s. The extent to which 
these nascent changes will lead to economic 
resilience  for women remains to be seen.  
Practical implications:  When looking at 
women’s economic resilience to the impact 
of climate change, it is critical to examine the 
gendered power relations within households 
and communities, because these often 
influence women’s participation in value 
chain activities. Additiona lly, resilience 
approaches that ignore broader economic 
processes, such as political and economic 
decisions and investment in infrastructure at 
the national level, may not adequately 
address women’s economic resilience 
against the im pact of climate change, 
because a lack of good infrastructure often 
worsens climate change impacts.   
Value: This paper adds the understanding of 
gender norms to resilience thinking and 
theoretical frameworks.

1. Introduction  
Climate change impacts agricultural 
productivity, food security and livelihoods 
(Nazirul et al. 2019). Several factors, such as 
gender norms, exacerbate these impacts on 
women by making them more vulnerable 
because of preexisting social and economic 
inequalities (Awiti 2022; Akinsemolu and 
Olukoya 2020). Studies have been 
conducted on underlying institutional factors 
on gender and climate change (Ume et al. 
2021). Climate change disproportionately 
impacts women because of their 
responsibility for food and nutrition security 
for families (Omoyemen 2010). In general, 
women ha ve low levels of adaptation to 
climate change (Boko 2007) because of a 
lack of access to resources and technologies 
and low levels of knowledge and education.  
Several factors influence women’s adaptive 
capacities, including their work burdens, 
discriminatory gender norms and women’s 
underrepresentation in climate policy 
decision -making at all levels (FAO 2023). 
Gender norms and institutional factors 
exacerbate t hese deficiencies, preventing 
women from accessing, owning, and using 
the necessary resources for adaptation. The 
impact of adverse climate events varies 
depending on gender and socioeconomic 
status. For example, low -income women may 
experience high impact  and slow recovery 
periods from events like flooding (Ajibade et 
al. 2013).  
Because of their inadequate access to 
productive resources like agricultural land, 
women cannot make decisions that could 
affect community activities such as mitigation 
and adaptation plans and food production 
(ESCAP 2022). Gender norms that restrict the roles and agency of women hamper their 
access to and adoption of new agricultural 
technologies and farming techniques that 
are better suited to accelerating adaptation 
to weather and climate changes. Gender 
disparities in access and control of resource s 
pertinent to value chain activities are 
exacerbated by the rising impact of climate 
change challenges, especially in countries 
like Nigeria, where there is a high 
dependence on agriculture as the main 
source of livelihood. In analyzing the ability 
to cope wit h and adapt to climate change 
from a gender perspective for smallholder 
farmers in Ghana, Assan et al. (2018) 
observed that male heads of households 
tend to adopt and use climate adaptation 
innovations more than female household 
heads. Women and other soci ally 
marginalized groups continue to experience 
the more significant impact of climate crises.  
The interplay between the gendered 
impacts of climate change and food security 
in Nigeria is poorly documented (Anugwa et 
al. 2023). Many studies have looked at men 
and women as binary categories but have 
not dug deeper to understand how gender 
relations a nd norms affect women’s ability to 
be economically resilient to the impacts of 
climate change. For instance, stereotypical 
threats may prevent women from taking on 
roles that can promote their resilience to 
climate change and adaptive capacities 
because of  the fear of being judged 
negatively by others from their community. 
Studies have illustrated that the gendered 
impacts of climate change can vary from 
community to community (Akinsemolu and 
Olukoya 2020), and women's sensitivity and 
adaptive capacity diff er from value chain to 
value chain. Using case studies of three value 
chains in Nigeria (cassava, catfish and 
chicken), this paper will investigate how 
gender norms impact women’s economic 
resilience to climate change impacts.

 2. Context  
Like other developing countries, Nigeria is 
highly dependent on agriculture and its 
natural resource base, increasing the 
likelihood of significant impacts of climate 
variability and environmental degradation 
on livelihoods for men and women. The 
country’s  climate has changed and is 
increasingly experiencing rising 
temperatures, unpredictable rainfall 
patterns, rising sea levels and flooding, 
drought and desertification, land 
degradation, increased frequency of 
extreme weather events, depleted 
freshwater su pplies and a decline in 
biodiversity (Ebele and Emodi 2016; Elisha 
et al. 2017; Olaniyi et al. 2014). Low 
agricultural productivity has also been a key 
impact of climate change in Nigeria 
(Omoyemen 2010). As a climate change 
hotspot, Nigeria presents a com pelling case 
to understand how gender norms influence 
women’s economic resilience (Akinsemolu 
and Obafemi 2019) in the face of climate 
change impacts to identify key levers to 
foster transformative change that improves 
the adaptive capacities of women.  
Patriarchal traditions and norms and 
economic, political, educational and 
environmental factors increase women’s 
vulnerability to climate change in Nigeria 
(Akinsemolu and Obafemi 2019). For 
example, exposure to extreme weather 
events, including flooding, drought and 
rising sea levels, increases the labor burdens 
of women and girls, because they must walk 
long distances in search of clean water. In 
many communities in Nigeria, women have low levels of education because of gender 
and social norms surrounding  school that 
negatively affected them as girls. Lack of 
education makes them rely more on natural 
resource -based livelihoods than men, which 
exacerbates their vulnerability to climate 
change variability. Furthermore, lack of 
access to critical climate -smar t information 
impedes women and other vulnerable 
groups from responding effectively to 
climate change. Although climate change 
severely impacts women who engage in 
agriculture, they are excluded from making 
decisions related to climate change and how 
to ad apt (Ume et al. 2021).  
This study was conducted in Ogun State (fish 
value chains) and Oyo State (chicken and 
cassava value chains). Ogun and Oyo are 
two of Nigeria’s six states in the Southwest 
geopolitical zone. Ogun hosts the largest 
hub of aquaculture enterprises in West Afri ca 
and is among the top catfish -producing 
states in the country. Women in the state are 
not economically empowered (Ntiwunka 
2013) and suffer various forms of domestic 
violence, which affects their performance in 
agriculture and engagement in a variety of 
livelihood activities (Gbolahan and Ayodapo 
2023; Ashimolowo and Tufale 2012). 
Women in Ogun are highly engaged in 
catfish processing but earn low incomes. 
Oyo is one of the top 10 cassava -producing 
states in the country and is a high producer 
of commercia l broiler chickens. Just like in 
Ogun, women in Oyo have low 
empowerment levels, and gender income 
inequalities persist for the cassava value 
chain (Donkor et al. 2022) and low access to 
use of loans for female chicken farmers, 
leading to low productivity on their farms 
(Otunaiya et al. 2014

3. Methodology  
This paper adopts a resilience approach to 
understand how gender norms shape 
women’s economic resilience to climate 
change impacts. Resilience approaches look 
at the capacity of people to respond to 
anticipated and unanticipated climate 
changes in ways tha t allow sustainable 
adaptation and continued transformation to 
meet current and future challenges. 
Resilience approaches consider  
  
three key issues: (1) exposure to shock, (2) 
sensitivity and (3) adaptive capacity 
(Thompson -Hall 2016). Sensitivity refers to 
the likelihood of being harmed once 
exposed to a shock, and adaptive capacity 
relates to the tools and resources that can be 
used  to adapt to the change and their use. 
We use the resilience approach to 
understand how gender norms shape 
sensitivities to climate shocks, women’s 
adaptive capacities and their economic 
resilience to climate chang e.

 Figure 2. Resilience approach to data analysis.
Men and women are exposed to the same 
shocks but have different adaptive capacities 
because of their different lived experiences.  
Resilience approaches are criticized for 
ignoring power dynamics (Thompson -Hall 
2016), such as resilience for whom and what 
resilience means to different actors (Tanner 
et al. 2015). In the context of economic 
resilience, for example, the focus is usually 
on what institutional changes can be made 
to protect and promote economic gains, 
which often ignores the power dynamics in 
defining and using the term “resilience.” 
However, the approach in this paper 
integrates the analysis of gender norms and 
livelihoods , acknowledging the power 
relations between men and women in 
communities and households and focusing 
on economic resilience for women.  
3.1 Tools and sampling  
The study used qualitative research tools, 
including a stakeholder workshop, IDIs, KIIs  and FGDs, to understand c limate change 
and its impacts on value chain performance 
and livelihoods and how gender norms 
affect  women’s economic resilience to 
climate change challenges. Study 
participants were purposively selected, as 
outlined in Table 1, to ensure representation 
from the cassava, catfish, and chicken value 
chains. Respondents included producers, 
processors, traders, and value chain 
supporters and service providers, such as 
input suppliers, farmers association leaders, 
microfinance staff, and  officials from the 
government and nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs). We selected three 
value chains to understand how gender 
norms mediate the impacts of climate 
change on women’s economic resilience at 
the AFS level. We focused on value chain 
actors a nd chain supporters from all nodes 
to gain a deeper understanding of how 
climate change impacts affect the entire 
chain.

3.2 Description of the sample  
The study first hosted a stakeholders  
workshop in Ibadan. Seventeen stakeholders 
(eight men and nine women) participated in 
the workshop. They came from academia, 
NGOs, government departments, the private 
sector, farmers associations and other nodes 
of the value chain —all with a national or 
regional perspective of the value chains of 
interest. The stakeholders adopted a 
participatory approach that led to mutual 
interaction and learning, as well as 
discussion with the different actors across 
the three value chains. Three main tools 
were applied :  
• Tool 1: Background information on 
climate change impacts on the 
value chain of interest  • Tool 2: Gendered value chain 
mapping  
• Tool 3: Actor analysis tool.  
Tool 1 elicited information about how critical 
events, including those related to climate 
change, had affected the value chains over 
the past 10 years. Tool 2 was applied to map 
the actors involved in the value chain from a 
gender perspective. Tool 3 was u sed to 
profile the various chain supporters in the 
cassava, catfish and chicken value chains.  
The study also conducted 55 IDIs and KIIS as 
well as 18 FGDs. Eighteen respondents each 
were interviewed for the catfish and chicken 
value chains, and 19 for the cassava value 
chain.

All the men who participated were at least 
36 years old, as were 60 percent of the 
women. The rest of the women were aged 
35 or below.  
The study also implemented a total of 18 sex 
disaggregated FGDs (9 men’s groups and 9 
women’s groups) with a total of 27 men and 
27 women participating in FGDs in each of 
the three value chains.  
3.3 Data analysis  
Three key activities were implemented 
during data analysis. The first included 
developing a codebook using the study 
tools. The second involved reading the transcripts to update the code book from the 
dataset. The third included data coding and 
analysis. The coding methodology included 
a hybrid deductive –inductive approach. The 
study used NVIVO coding software to code 
the data.  
4. Results  
The results section is structured into three 
key themes. The first theme focuses on the 
exposure to climate shocks and their impact 
on the different value chains. The second 
focuses on the impact of these shocks on 
men and women, and the third on how 
gende r norms prevent women from building 
economic resilience to climate change 
challenges.  
4.1 Exposure to climate shocks and their impact 
on chicken, cassava and catfish value chain  
The actors identified six key climate 
change challenges across the three 
different value chains: (1) flooding or 
heavy rain, (2) inadequate or infrequent 
rainfall, (3) pests and insect and diseases, 
(4) drought, sunshine and excess heat, (5) 
no sunshine an d (6) extreme

 4.1.1 Flooding or heavy rain  
Most farmers and key stakeholders 
mentioned flooding or excessive rains as a 
key climate - or weather -related event 
affecting the three value chains. Although it 
was suggested that floods and droughts are 
increasing, many in the study did not believe 
the fl ooding and heavy rains result from 
climate change impacts. Instead, they said 
the main causes of flooding are poor 
infrastructure development, such as the lack 
of proper drainage systems, growth of 
unplanned cities, and construction on 
wetlands or other wa ter channels, which 
affects ecological patterns and the 
morphology of rivers. Poor road facilities 
affect farmers’ productivity and income, 
especially in rural areas. This compounds the 
problems because it makes it hard to reach  
farms and take products to markets when it 
rains. Respondents in the catfish value chain 
in Ogun State also mentioned poor city 
planning as another cause. They said that 
they were affected by floods, especially 
having their fish swept away or ponds 
contami nated, causing high fish mortalities 
and leading to the collapse of some fish 
farms.  
“As I sit here, I lost more than 7 million 
Naira,” said a participant in the male catfish 
farmers FGD in Ogun State. “When the rain 
came, the river became filled … the river was 
filled beyond level. All of us here if we 
calculate the amount of money we los t here, 
maybe we lost billions of Naira.”  
Cassava and chicken farmers said the poor 
road network, which is worsened by floods, 
prevents them from easy access to their 
farms and the market. During floods, it is 
difficult for some chicken farmers to access 
their farms, leading to loss of birds and 
equipment. Normally, those producing huge 
amounts of chickens have farms away from 
their homesteads and experience 
devastating losses.  Heavy rain also impacts the chicken value 
chain. If the weather is too wet, chickens 
become exposed to diseases because 
farmers fail to keep the coops dry. They 
need to pack dry wood shavings on the floor 
of the chicken coops, but shavings are in 
short sup ply at the sawmill during the rainy 
season. Heavy rain also increases the time it 
takes to complete certain tasks. For instance, 
after using shavings as litter, chicken farmers 
dry, package and sell it to vegetable farmers, 
who will eventually use it as fe rtilizer. With 
heavy rains, chicken farmers cannot dry the 
shavings and so cannot sell them. Since they 
cannot dry the shavings, they must remove 
them from the chicken coop. There is also 
the added problem of air pollution resulting 
from the foul smell.  
Flooding affects the production of crops 
such as maize, soybean and sunflower, which 
are key raw materials for producing chicken 
feed. This, in turn, raises the price of inputs. 
As such, flooding leads to high feed costs 
and, ultimately, to high production  costs and 
ripple effects across the chicken value chain. 
When the cost of feed increases, chicken 
farmers may temporarily drop out of chicken 
farming, affecting other input suppliers such 
as hatchery operators and drug and vaccine 
sellers because their sa les will go down from 
the lack of demand for their products. When 
flooding occurs, the risks of chicken diseases 
increase, because chicken farmers require 
more medications and other biosecurity 
measures. Chicken coops may get flooded, 
requiring farmers to relocate their chickens 
or raising the coops to avoid floodwaters. 
Additionally, heavy rain lowers the chickens’ 
capacity to lay eggs, and so the eggs 
become small. Also, the roofs of the coops 
can leak, affecting the health and production 
of the chickens.  
Cassava farmers noted that heavy rain has 
destroyed cassava roots, rotting them and 
leading to low productivity and poor 
harvests.

Nigeria  12 
 4.1.1.1  How flooding and heavy rain 
affect the marketing and processing 
of agricultural products  
Flooding also affects the marketing of fish 
and chicken because the roads are poorly 
maintained, and buyers and traders cannot 
travel to affected villages and communities 
to acquire the products. Also, flooding 
increases the transportation time because it 
makes bad roads even worse, leading to 
product loss and spoilage. Additionally, 
when farmers call buyers to purchase 
produce, they cannot travel because of 
floods or because roads are damaged even 
when the floods have receded.  
 
When there is flooding, fish processors, who 
are mostly women, do not have access to fish 
to process, similar to when there is excessive 
heat or a long dry spell. During these times, 
the cost of fish goes up —from NGN 500 for a 
big fish to NGN 700 for a sma ll fish. This also 
affects fish processors. Additionally, when 
there is a lot of rain, fish processors suffer 
losses. Rainfall affects patronage because 
clients may not show up after a processor 
has killed their fish, causing the fish to spoil. 
For those m aking fish pepper soup, clients 
do not like soup made from refrigerated fish, 
because they claim this spoils the taste. Also, 
fish becomes scarce during dry weather, and 
prices become higher, making business 
more challenging for those who sell fish. 
Rivers  no longer flow well;  ponds are dry and 
feed prices go up.  
During the rainy season and when there is 
heavy rain, it takes longer to smoke fish 
using charcoal. Processors may lose fish. 
During normal weather, it can take a 
processor 3 to 4 days to process their fish, 
but during rainy weather it can take 6 to 7 
days  to dry the fish because the charcoal is 
wet. A prolonged drying period can cause 
the fish to spoil. Although this problem is 
expected during the rainy season, extreme 
weather changes have exacerbated the 
problem. Sometimes, it will rain so much that even the charcoal in storage, or during 
transportation, will get soaked. In this case, 
processors will not have time to dry their 
charcoal to smoke their fish. Fish processors 
now spend too much time trying to dry their 
charcoal to make it easier to smoke fish 
during this time.  
When the rain comes with heavy wind, 
women who process garri  have problems 
frying it. They will also not have access to 
good cassava when it rains because they 
cannot go to the farm to get it.  
4.1.2 Inadequate or infrequent rainfall  
Study participants regarded rainfall as no 
longer consistent; it may come too early, too 
late or not at all. Early onset of rains affects 
the planting of cassava. When farmers 
cannot plant and harvest yam, cassava and 
maize, processors and transporters are  also 
affected.  
“Six or five years ago, we used to load up our 
vehicles overnight, but [now] we wake up 
early and are barely able to fill up our 
vehicles,” said a male cassava transporter in 
Oyo State. “Can you see how climate change 
has affected us as transporters? When 
farmers cannot get good yields because of 
climate change, then transporters like me 
will not have any work to do. It affects our 
sales.”  
Farmers can no longer rely on rainfall 
patterns because of extreme variation from 
season to season and area to area.  
4.1.3 Drought and excess heat  
Droughts affect producers but have ripple 
effects on the whole value chain. 
Stakeholders noted that, before 2015, there 
used to be a lot of rainfall. Now, however, by 
June or July the quantity of water has 
decreased drastically. Farmers across all 
three va lue chains can no longer rely on rain -
fed agriculture. Long dry spells and droughts 
also lead to low harvests and household 
food insecurity. In turn, poor harvests lead to 
diet changes because farmers can no longer 
Page 14:

Nigeria  13 
 rely only on the crops they farm. Some 
cassava farmers mentioned eating corn, 
which they never ate during the “old days,” 
because, with unreliable rainfall, their 
preferred food crops are not performing 
well.  
Fish farmers mentioned excess heat as 
problematic because it increases fish 
mortality and affects water quality and the 
biological processes of the fish. Very high 
temperatures dry the ponds, particularly for 
farmers who depend on groundwater 
instead of bo rehole water.  
“Fish farmers want to pump water but do not 
have many boreholes,” said a female 
government officer in Ogun State. “So, they 
look for swampy land, where the water can 
build itself up. With climate change and the 
high temperature, the swamps dry up faster. 
When the swamps dry, fish are harvested 
earli er, at 3 to 4 months, not at 5 or 6 months 
when they are supposed to be harvested.”

  INTRODUCTION  
Initiative to Increase Women’s Voice and Agency in 
Demanding  Assets for Climate Resilience  
 
The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) , one of the research centers 
within the global Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) , 
has a long history of gender research relevant to its mission of reducing poverty and 
ending hunger and malnutrition. Over the last two decades, gender has been 
effectively incorporated into all of IFPRI’s strategic research areas and into all phases 
of research . There is abundant e vidence of IFPRI’s role as a leading global think tank 
on gender issues .  
The broader CGIAR  shares IFPRI’s  strong commitment to high -quality  gender 
research. This commitment is embodied in the CGIAR Gender Impact Platform, the 
CGIAR Research Initiative on Gender Equality, and a network of gender research 
coordinators embedded in all CGIAR centers. Collectively, these efforts and their 
affiliat ed gender researchers work continuously with partners to fill gender and 
inclusion evidence gaps; build capacity and set directions to enable CGIAR to have 
maximum impact on gender equality;  and promote opportunities for youth and social 
inclusion in agriculture and food systems.  
IFPRI leads the Methods Module of the Gender Platform, developing, maintaining, 
and disseminating tools and guides on gathering and analyzing gender -
disaggregated data . Perhaps most prominently, i n 2012 , USAID commissioned 
researchers at  IFPRI and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative  to 
develop the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI),  a tool designed to 
measure the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural 
sector. Over the past 11 years, the tool has been used by over 2 49 organizations 
across 60 countries to track and measure women’s empowerment, and IFPRI 
researchers have evaluated the effectiveness of different ways to raise women’s 
empowerment through various  policies and programs.  
Two CGIAR research initiatives —Gender Equality and National Policies and Strategies —
have partnered to launch and evaluate programming designed to raise women’s 
ability to exercise  their voice and agency in community settings. Specifically, this 
training manual focuses on developing the skills necessary to articulate aspirations 
and goals related to individual and community assets that could be built through the  
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act  (MGNREGA ) program  in 1 
Page 5:

 India . The MGNREGA is  a rural workfare program  that guarantees a certain number of 
days of unskilled manual work per year to rural households at a specified minimum 
wage; this labor is used to create durable assets that can serve as the basis for 
sustainable livelihoods. Crucially, MNREGA  envisions a ‘bottom -up’ process of 
deliberation,  in which all members of communities have a right to participate in the 
village -level meetings where the shelf of works is agreed upon  and are empowered 
to play a role in decision -making about wh ich assets to build.   
The first step toward the development of this training manual  was a baseline 
assessment  conducted in early 2023. The assessment looked at women’s access to 
information  and understanding about how to request assets and whether  they have 
tried and been successful in the past at requesting an asset. The assessment occurred  
with over 3,000 randomly  sampled MGNREGA women job card holders in  five 
districts across the state of Odisha  (Figure 1) : Balangir , Ganjam, Kalahandi, 
Mayurbhanj, and Rayagada. These districts were chosen to represent different agro -
climatic zones as well as differing levels of engagement with the MGNREGA  program .

 Key findings of the assessment include:  
• Women’s overall knowledge of program rules  regarding work and asset 
demand  is low .  
• Yet, many women have an idea of what they would request if they had the 
chance . 
• There is considerable variation across districts in whether women have ever 
tried to request an asset —ranging from 55 percent of our sample in Balangir to 
4 percent in Mayurbhanj —but very few women have ever been successful in the 
past at requesting an asset.  
• About half of women in our sample report at least some comfort with speaking 
up in public but say that community officials at village -level meetings at which 
asset construction is discussed only pay attention to women “to some extent.”  
 
This suggests three  significant disconnects between program goals of including 
communities in the process of planning for what MGNREGA assets would be built 
through the program and the experience of rural women. First, there is an 
informational gap : many women do hold ideas about assets that would be useful to 
them to improve their livelihoods and their resilience,  but they lack specific 
information about how to put those ideas into practice. Second, there is a skills gap : 
women may hold ideas about what wo uld be useful to them and either already know 
about the formal process for requesting asset s or be able to quickly learn the process 
when provided with information . Yet, they  lack the skills and confidence needed to 
navigate the more informal parts of community planning processes like speaking up 
in public fora, clearly articulating demands, and coordinating with other stakeholders 
in the community. Third, the assessment revealed a responsiveness gap , suggesting 
that local leaders and government functionaries are not always responsive to ideas 
even when women are able to  navigate formal or informal processes  to submit 
proposals .   
Based on the assessment outlined above and IFPRI’s global experience working on 
issues related to women’s empowerment in the agricultural sector, IFPRI researchers 
developed the current curriculum, ‘Planning for Voice, ’ to equip women with key 
knowledge and skills to help them navigate the process of demanding  assets through 
the MGNREGA.  The curricul um addresses both the informational and skills gaps. It is 
possible that other types of interventions and programming would be needed to 
address the responsiven ess gap ; in short, information and skills may not themselves 
be sufficient .  
The curriculum is structured to work in small groups of women over the course of 2.5 
hours. Women in rural areas have significant obligations on their time , including 
Page 7:
 
6 
 unpaid care work,  and often have limited mobility.  It can be difficult  for them  to 
devote extensive periods of time to attend training sessions . Often, training sessions 
can be quite long, taking place over the course of several full days and conducted in 
large groups. Further, when many strangers are brought together in a central location 
to discuss potentially sensitive topics, there is a need to spend considerable time 
during the training introducing women to each other and ensuring that they feel 
comfor table enough with each other to speak up and share their ideas. This type of 
lengthy intervention might inadvertently exclude women for whom travel to a central 
location is difficult and who cannot easily find someone else to assume their 
household and economic responsibilities for longer periods of time.  
By contrast, ‘Planning for Voice’ is designed to work with women in small groups  
within their existing social networks , so that each woman  receives intensive focus and 
opportunities for practicing skills during a condensed time period.  By allowing 
women to select friends and neighbors who can participate in the training session 
with them from pre -existing social groups, this  format  capitalizes on existing social 
networks and bonding  amongst women , thus freeing up meeting  time for content 
and skill develop ment.   
By the end of the course, participants should be able to:  
• Understand the basic process for requesting a MGNREGA asset  and the key 
local stakeholders involved  
• Describe a MGNREGA asset that could improve their individual lives or 
livelihoods or improve the community more broadly  
• Articulate different ways that they could play a role in influencing what their 
community decides to build  
• Develop a strategy to overcome foreseen barriers to exercising their voice  and 
agency in their community

  HOW TO DELIVER 
THE CURRICULUM  
 
Preparing in Advance  
This is quite a busy agenda in a condensed time period, and preparation will b e key 
to ensur e that participants can cover all of the activities and topics in the allotted time 
period. Facilitators are expected to be familiar with the curriculum in advance and  to 
have reviewed all activities and modules before facilitating it. Other essential steps 
include congregating a small group (e.g., either by asking a target woman to identify 
friends/ neighbors who can join her, or otherwise tapping into existing group s to find 
a set of women willing to be trained); finding a safe place to conduct the training 
where women can have discussions  in private ; ensuring you select a time that works 
with women’s schedules ; having printed informational leaflets on hand; and setting 
up a way to screen the movie s, which may vary across contexts. Ideally, a battery -
powered projector will be used so that women can easily see the movie on a larger 
screen and so that electricity will not be required .  
Congregating a Group  
Existing groups have substantial social capital that is known to be important for 
empowering women both inside and beyond their household. Even outside of formal 
groups with regular meetings, women often have substantial social capital in the form 
of friends and neighbors who can be relied upon to provide support of many forms – 
financial, moral, etc. A strength of this curriculum lies in tapping this existing social 
capital , which can take extensive amounts of time to generate within the context of a 
newly -formed group of women who may not know each other very well, or may live 
sufficiently far away that they cannot realistically provide the type of support a woman 
may need.  3 
Page 11:
 
10 
 A key goal of the facilitator is identifying where th is social capital lies and 
approaching women to sign up for training. It is not the goal of the facilitator to form 
groups or ask women who may not know each other at all to come together. Rather, 
women should be engaged in a discussion of who are friends or neighbors (they may 
not be family members)  with whom they would like to participate in such a training. A 
target woman with whom a facilitator is talking may not immediately know who to 
name, but can be encouraged to describe: a) who are those women you rely on when 
you need something, or want to talk about something? b) when you wish to achieve a 
goal and need support from another woman, who do you consult? And c) do you 
participate in any groups with  other women? If so, who are women in those groups 
with whom you regularly talk?  
If the woman has many more friends and neighbors than can be accommodated, the 
facilitator should ask the woman  who among this group are the most central or 
important women amongst them  to her own personal social network . With a list of 
women, the facilitator can help the woman devise the appropriate strategy to 
approach them – either asking the women to round them up and arrive at the training 
venue with the women, or recruiting some of them his/herself.  
Creating an Environment Where Women Feel Comfortable  
It is important that women feel comfortable contributing and speaking up during the 
session. Some women may be naturally more vocal than others; the small groupings 
among known friends and neighbors are designed to ensure that even those who are 
naturally more reluctant to speak in large groups have a chance to practice their skills 
in a safe and comfortable setting. In contrast, in large groups, hesitant or shy women 
may successfully avoid practicing their skills and revert mostly to watching others 
practice. The curriculum is designed to include group activities and role play, which 
should provide women an opportunity to interac t more freely without feeling put ‘on 
the spot’ to produce an answer about a topic where they may not yet feel 
knowledgeable. Further, the fact that women already have a good deal of social 
capital with these women should help them continue to practice and engage with the 
women after going home.   
It is a good idea to start the session by explaining the goals of the training. The 
facilitator should start by read ing the following script to women :  
The following training is meant to support you, as women, to engage in the 
participatory process of asset selection under the M GNREGA program. You will 
be compensated for your time through a small snack  but will not receive any 
cash payment. It is our intention  that the training will position you to better 
engage with leaders , community members , and family members  in ways that 
ensure that the M GNREGA program supports you as a woman.  
Page 12:
 
11 
 After you begin,  it is your role as a facilitator to ensure that the session stays on topic 
and to redirect conversation if it veers off topic. It is also key that facilitators take care 
and have strategies for encouraging women who overpower conversation dynamics 
to listen and encouraging women who do not speak to participate . At the end of the 
session, you should recap ‘lessons learned’ and any important points made by 
women during the session as a reminder and to reinforce learning.  
At an appropriate moment during the session, women should be provided with  their 
snack  (e.g., chai  and a hot food item from a local vendor) . 
List of materials  
The following materials should be brought to each training:  
1. This manual.  
2. The information leaflets (bring 5-7 to each meeting).  
3. Projector  (ideally battery -powered)  
4. A white sheet to hang on the wall.  
5. Something to hang the sheet.  
6. Flip chart and marker.  
Instructions for Facilitators  
Each module contains a mix of things that the facilitator can say or explain to the 
participants ; things that the facilitator might ask the group , to spark conversation ; and 
activities that the group will complete together. These are clearly marked within each 
module:  
 SAY : 
These are things that the facilitator can say out loud to the 
participants, e.g. , introducing a new topic or concept.  
 ASK : 
These are question prompts that the facilitator should ask 
participants. If participants do  not jump in right away, consider 
rephrasing the question and offering examples for 
participants to react to.  
 
 ACTIVITY:  
These are activities that the facilitator will lead with the 
participants. Activities may involve getting up and moving 
around, acting, and drawing pictures. Have fun and try to get 
everyone participating.

INFORMATION    
*Allow 10 minutes to complete  
 
MATERIALS NEEDED  
• Information leaflets .  
 
Pass out the informational leaflets to begin the session.  
 
 SAY : 
We would like to start off our session with telling you a bit 
about the process for selecting assets in the Mahatma Gandhi 
National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 
Odish a. I have given each of you a leaflet which contains the 
information I am about to share with you now. This is yours to 
keep, and you can show it to your households, friends, and 
neighbors. As you know, given many of your households are 
MGNREGA job card ho lders, MGNREGA is a flagship social 
welfare program that aims to provide em ployment and 
livelihood security to rural households. One key component 
of this program is asset construction.  
 
All MGNREGA workers, that is, those who have a job card, 
have a right to participate in the Gram Sabha, Palli Sabha, or 
Ward Sabha and collectively propose the works and the order 
of priority to be taken up under MGNREGA for their 
Panchayat. Deciding which assets to select is a participatory 
process and all citizens, including women, have the  right to 
give inputs. These meetings are the place where the citizens’ 
voices are heard.  
 
You can request individual or community works under 
MGNREGA. Individual works are only for your household. 
A) 
Page 15:
 
14 
 Community works can serve multiple households, the whole 
village, or multiple members of your self -help group. 
Participating allows your voice to be heard and counted!  
 
So, what assets can you choose? Many types. The government 
has identified a list of works that are allowed under the Act. 
Some assets are declared by the Government as priority for 
2023 -24. For this year, assets related to natural resource 
management, agriculture and livelihoods works on individual 
land and livestock shelters for individual households are 
priority. You can check what is allowed with government 
officia ls (Gram Rozgaar Sewak (GRS) / Sarpanch) or Odisha 
government.  
 
Assets that have been created in your area so far include 
roads, community ponds, individual nurseries, land 
development works like land leveling and clearing, dug wells, 
farm ponds, goat shelters, horticulture plantations, and 
aquaculture, among others.  
 
So, who is preferred for individual assets on land or 
homesteads?  
 
First, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, nomadic and de -
notified tribes are preferred.  
 
Second, BPL households, women, or households headed by 
physically handicapped are a priority.  
 
Third, land reform beneficiaries, beneficiaries under the 
Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana -Gramin, beneficiaries under the 
Scheduled Tribes, and other Traditional Forest Dwellers are 
prioritized.  
 
Finally, small and medium farmers with less than 5 acres of 
land, landless and manual casual labor households are 
preferred.  
 
The only requirements are that their household has a job card, 
and at least one household member is willing to work on the 
project undertaken on their land or homestead.  
 
So, when can you demand assets? The process kickstarts from 
October 2! The Government has suggested that the Gram 
Page 16:
 
15 
 Panchayat level discussion and planning by ward / palli / 
Gram Sabha start on Gandhi Jayanti and continue over the 
next three months.  
 
Demands for assets can be raised at the ward and palli sabha. 
Speaking out gives citizens a chance to ensure their voice is 
heard and is necessary for their priorities to be considered 
and included in the annual “action plan” that is created as a 
result of  these meetings.  
 
Following these meetings, a Special Gram Sabha for approval 
of the Gram Panchayat level annual action plan usually 
happens between October 3rd and November 30th. The Gram 
Panchayat then has to submit the GP level plan to the Block 
Panchayat by December 5th. Timelines might be delayed this 
year due to the sarpanch strike. To learn about the key dates 
in your community, you can check with your sarpanch or Gram 
Rozgaar Sewak (GRS). Checking can ensure that you as 
women do not lose your chance to participate.  
 
For more information, speak to your GRS, ward members, or 
panchayat members! Their jobs include supporting all 
citizens, including women.  
 
This process happens every year. So, if you don’t have an idea 
for this year, please consider an asset for next year!

 VIDEO SCREENING   
 
 
*Allow 20 -25 minutes to complete  
 
MATERIALS NEEDED  
• Projector , screen,1 and comfortable seating arrangement for participants. 
Private place to screen the film away from other household members.  
 
 SAY : 
You are about to watch a short movie. This movie —“The Power 
of Voice: MGNREGA Success Stories ”—shows the stories of 
real women from Odisha State who participate d in asset 
selection as part of  the MGNREGA program and were able to 
suggest and receive an asset through the program. They will 
talk about their experiences in trying to obtain assets, different 
obstacles that they faced, and how they overcame them. We’ll 
all watch the movie together. There will be a few key places 
where I’ll pause the movie so that we can all talk about it.   
 
 
*Screen the movie.  There will be 4 -5 places in the film where the movie indicates 
that you should stop and discuss the question on the movie screen. Please 
ensure that you pause at these key places and discuss the questions on the 
screen. You should read the questions aloud  to ensure that everyone 
understands.

 VIDEO DISCUSSION: 
Overcoming Barriers  
 
 
*Allow 10-15 minutes to complete . If discussion has been robust during the 
questions posed during the video, this module will be shorter. If the discussion 
has been relatively brief during the video itself, then this module should be 
extended.  
 
OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this module is to talk about how the themes and ideas seen in the 
video relate to participating  women’s own lives. Specifically, this discussion should 
focus on highlight ing any barriers that the women in the video identified to achieving 
their asset construction goals and how they overcame those barriers. Then, 
participants should discuss whether they have faced any of the same challenges (or 
heard about others who have) and brainstorm what barriers they might face in their 
own lives if they were to request  MGNREGA assets and how those might be 
overcome.  
 
MATERIALS NEEDED  
Flip chart and marker

Page 19:
 
18 
  SAY : 
There can be a lot of different barriers that make it difficult for 
women to obtain MGNREGA assets that could really help their 
lives and improve their livelihoods.  
 
A barrier  is something that makes it difficult for someone to 
achieve their goal.  
 
I’m going to make a chart here of some of the different 
barriers that women in the film identified and the strategies 
that they used to overcome those barriers during the 
participatory process of demanding a MNREGA asset. Then, 
I’d like you to think about other barriers that you see that 
women like you face to achieving the goal of demanding  a 
MGNREGA asset, and your ideas about strategies  that could 
be used to overcome those barriers.  
 
 
 ASK : 
What barriers did you hear women discussing in the film? 
What barriers do you think are the greatest to women 
requesting an asset? Have you or anyone you know faced the 
same or similar barriers? What other barriers might there be?  
 
 
*Each chart should reflect the specific barrier and strategies identified by the 
women in the training session. Here is an example chart to show how this could 
be done. If women are struggling to come up with ideas, you could use some of 
the examples below  to prompt discussion.  The facilitator should be the one 
holding the pen and writing up the ideas to fill in the chart as the women offer 
their ideas.  
 
Barriers  Strategies  
- E.g., It can be difficult to speak up 
in a public setting  - E.g., I can practice beforehand 
with my neighbors, my husband, 
and other community members 
and gain their support before a 
meeting  
- E.g., My husband will not agree 
with the asset that I would like to 
recommend  - E.g., We can discuss our 
preferences beforehand , and 
maybe I will be surprised at his 
Page 20:
 
19 
 reaction. He may also keep my 
idea in mind for the future  
- E.g., I can discuss my asset 
preferences with a women’s self -
help group and find other women 
to make a project 
recommendation with  me 
- E.g., Men already know what is 
right for us, so I do not need to 
speak  - There are some things that 
women want that men care about 
a bit less (e.g., soak pits, toilets, 
fruit tree plantations, fodder 
cultivation for fuel, and 
nutri gardens ), and speaking up 
can help them be recognized as 
valuable assets to women  
- E.g., I’m really not sure what type 
of project I would even 
recommend  - I can speak to the MGNREGA 
functionary or other people I 
know about my ideas beforehand  
- E.g., I’m so busy with housework 
and childcare that I cannot find 
the time to do this  - E.g., I can join up with other 
women who can help develop a 
proposal with me  
- E.g. I am not allowed to attend 
either the palli sabha or gram 
sabha  - I can approach ward members 
with my request or persuade 
others  (such as members of my 
self-help group, friends)  to place 
my demand in the palli sabha  
- E.g., I feel that there is no point 
even asking for an asset since 
nobody listens to women anyway  - Even if nobody tends to listen 
now, I can still speak up and help 
normalize women speaking up 
and feel good about that

 SOCIAL MAPPING 
ACTIVITY  
 
 
*Allow 20-30 minutes to complete .  
 
OBJECTIVE  
A social map provides a bird’s eye view of a community, illustrating where social 
infrastructure is located in a community in relation to where people live and work. The 
purpose of this specific social map is to think about the assets that could be built 
through the MGNREGA program on a very localized map of where the participant 
lives. It should focus on the area around the participant’s home and include things like 
their own home, neighbors’ homes, roads or paths, irrigation -related infrastructure, 
produc tive farmland, pasture -land, fallow or waste land, and drainage and 
groundwater -related infrastructure. Because of the detailed categories, it is essential 
to focus on a very small geographic area nearby the homes of participating  women 
only . Relevant MGNREGA -eligible assets for consideration are listed in the table 
below. Please prevent women from trying to map the entire village or a large 
geographic area. The objective is to really zoom in nearby to their homes to help 
them think about what MGNREGA assets could be useful to them.  
The objective of creating the map is to help women think about ‘gaps’ that exist near 
their homes where an asset allowable through the MGNREGA program could be 
useful to them. To think about overcoming barriers  to women influencing the asset 
construction process, it is first important for them to think about what assets could be 
constructed, which they have already, and what would be most useful to them.

MATERIALS NEEDED  
Flip chart and marker  
 
 ACTIVITY : 
• Explain the purpose of the exercise to the women and 
how it can be useful to them to think through what 
additional assets they might request to make their lives 
easier and their land more productive . 
• Using a flipchart and markers or other suitable drawing 
tools, ask the participants to identify north, south, east, 
and west. Then, start placing their homes on the map 
along with any canals, roads, or paths. If there is 
prominent communal infrastructure i n this immediate  
geographic area like schools, health clinics, drinking 
water sources, or religious buildings, these should be 
added as well.  This map should not cover the whole 
village – just the areas very near to the participants’ 
homes.  
• Once the primary buildings have been identified, start 
talking about the land in between the buildings. Which 
areas are productive farmlands? Which areas may be 
fallow? Is there irrigation -related infrastructure around? 
Infrastructure to address groundwater or drainage 
issues? Where are existing wells, ponds, shelters, and 
other facilities?

Although seed is an  integral part of the agri -food system, it is often unavailab le and unaffordab le 
to smallholder farmers  in rural areas , especially  women  and vulnerable groups . In addition, the 
poor extension system of get ting seeds  and information to farmers  remains a drawback to 
adoption and increased productivity.  Further, increased climate variability  exposes  these 
vulnerable groups to risks  like pests and diseases . This calls for more concerted and focused 
strategies b y researchers and development actors to mitigate these challenges  through robust 
partnerships and training .  
The Kenya Agricultural Livestock Research Organization  (KALRO) and t he Alliance of 
Bioversity International a nd CIA T, The Alliance through t he Seed Equal Initiati ve, the Gender 
Equality  Initiative , the Ukama  Ustawi  (UU): Diversification for Resilient Agri -food in East and 
Southern Africa  organized a two-day training of extension officers from Laikip ia and Nyeri 
Page 2:
counties  in Kenya  in gender -responsive seed systems, digitalised agribusiness and ag ronomy.  
The training was attended by  16 officers ( 5 men and 11 women).  
The training covered diverse topics , among them  behavioral  change in bean production and 
marketing, bean varieties and  seed syste ms, good agronomy for beans, pest and disease 
management,  farming beans as a business , gender and inclusion, digital tools for technolog y 
dissemination (animations) , approaches  to extension, among others . 
While addressing the team, Dr. Patrick K etiem, the Institute Director, Agricultural Mechanization 
Research Institute , Katumani , noted that a strong  and responsive extension system is critical for 
an effective an d equitable last mile delivery of agricultural services, technologies,  and 
innovati ons for increased agricultural production. He noted that counties remain the major 
drivers of agricultur al transformation s. However, due to the sector's declining human resources 
and low funding , the desired extension services remain weak and largely inacc essible  to most  
farmers . This has led to decreased agricultural producti on and increased food and nutrition 
insecurity risk . Therefore, there is a need to strengthen the capacity of the extension staf f and 
other last-mile agricultural service providers to address the emerging agricultural challenges .  
Hon. Wilson Maringa, Chief Officer of Agriculture , Livestock an d Aquaculture,  Nyeri County , 
noted  that the Kenya Kwanza Government ’s Agriculture Strategy objective is increa sing food 
production. To deliver the  government strategy, the County has reserved a budget for resilien t 
crops, beans, being on  of them . Beans were selected for  their nutritio nal value - protein, 
carbohydrates, vitamins, and micronutrients , mainly iron and zinc.  
Laikipia and Nyeri counties lie within the Central Rift Valley and Central  Kenya. The counties 
have a huge potential for bean production , although this has not been f ully tapped to benefit the 
farmers and the rural economies.  The main challenges  to bean production in these counties are 
inadequate seeds, lo w adoption of certified seeds, mixes of beans, low prices, delayed payment,  
and the changing climate resulting in high pests and disease infestation. Issue s of gender have 
not been adequately inte grated into their bean value chain pl anning and implementati on.  
Madam Elizabeth Mwangi, Chief Officer of Agriculture and Irrigation , Laikipia County ,  
highlighted the importance of developing a successful bean production and marketing model that 
can be scaled to other parts of the county. She acknowledged that bea ns mean business as they 
can be grown in two seasons , are inclusive and can improve farmers’ livelihood . 
For the corridor approach to work, we need a mindset change in producing and mar keting 
beans , observed  David Karanja , Grain Legu me and Bean Leader  at KALRO . He further noted  
there is a need to understand which varieties are demanded to determine those in subsistence and 
those in commercial farming, translating to a co -developmen t of an effective delivery model for 
seed at planting  and grain at harve sting , moving from individual to collective marketing. This 
calls for all county players  to come on board to make the corridor work .  
There has been a growth in interest in be an production in Nyeri and Laikipia County following 
promotion  efforts  by KALRO  and County extension officers . Farmer s growing Nyota bean, one 
of the micronutrient rich drought tolerant bean varieties  have reported yield s of up to  8 bags per 
Page 3:
acre in Naromoru -Kiamathaga ward in Kieni East, Nyeri County . School feeding  is also an entry 
point for disseminating  bean production and marketing information to farmers  in these counties . 
Ten schools in Kieni East, Nyeri County  are supported to grow and consume beans . 
In a changing climate, there is a need to build resil ience of the farming systems  by adopting 
climate smart agriculture at all levels of the bean value chain, noted Boaz Waswa, Soil Fertility 
Expert at ABC. The participants were trained in identification and management of major pests  
and diseases of beans. The count y extension can help farmers access the right technologies and 
seasonal climate information to guide production operations.  
 
As we work on a structured market for beans, we need to understand the cost of bean production 
and pricing, especially as farmers are linked to markets , noted Paul Aseete, Business Expert at 
the Seed  Equal Initiative .  
Using bean production data from the counties, the participants were trained on how to carry out 
cost-benefit analysis of the bean enterprises. The tool enable d the par ticipants to simulate  various 
scenarios and explore the effect  of changes in cost of inputs, market prices of grain and prices, on 
overall profitability of the bean production. The different scenarios enable better decision making 
in farming  beans as a business. 
 
Men, women, and youth play different roles along the bean value c hain. There is need therefore 
to be deliberate in integrating gender consideration at all nodes of the bean value chain , noted 
Page 4:
Eileen Nchanji, Gender Expe rt, The All iance . The Gender Equal ity Initiative has developed a 
framework for monitoring gender. U sing such a lens ensures that none of the actors is 
disadvantaged and that all included, benefit and are empowered . Examples are the seed revolving 
fund in Kenya , gender -friendly technologies in Kenya  and gender -responsive  nutrition training in 
Uganda .  
In a technologically changing world, there is a need to adopt innovative extension approaches 
that take advantage of the digital solutions and which are mo re visual and  interactive. The 
animations can complement the traditional approaches such as face -to-face, train and visit 
approaches, brochures, field days and demonstrations. The participants were introduced to Bean 
Animations  developed by the Pan Africa  Bean Res earch Alliance . The animations cover  diverse 
topics on bea ns s uch as land preparation, choice of  seed, growing beans, post -harvest 
management, nutrition and school feeding. The animations are available in English, Kiswahili 
and French. The y can be accessed via YouTube , downloaded,  and played on the phone. A short 
survey on the appropriateness and usab ility of the animations will inform continuous 
improvement of th is knowledge and information dissemination approach.  
 
Dr Boaz Waswa  welcomed the strong collaboratio n between KALRO, The Alliance -PABRA and 
the counties in addressing the extension gaps. This will  provide a great  opportunity for  scaling 
research  technologies and increased bean production.  He called for  partner ships with  more 
counties and stakeholders to scale inclusive a nd innovative climate smart technologie s and 
innovations for  enhanced food security o f the nation. Going forward, the partners committed to 
strengthening the partnership to scale out micronutrient rich beans production and consumpti on 
in Nyeri and Laikipia Counties.

TRAINING WORKSHOP ON GENDER-RESPONSIVE AND NUTRITION-SENSITIVE AGRICULTUREGENDER EQUALITY TECHNICAL REPORT3The Gender Equality Initiative (HER+) conducts innovative gender and social science research to 
develop actionable solutions to enhance climate resilience and empowerment of women in Africa and Asia. As one-size-fits-all solutions do not exist, HER+ identifies and develops diverse scenari-os for co-creation of bundling socio-technical innovations. In Ethiopia, the initiative is closely work-ing with the Veggies for Planet and People (V4P&P) project implemented by  the World Vegetable 
Center and SNV (Netherlands Development Organisation) that aims to improve vegetable produc-
tion, consumption and marketing. The project focuses on youth and women job creation while safeguarding the environment through regenerative agricultural practices and Vegetable Business Networks (VBNs).
The HER+ program activities support the WorldVeg’s intervention through women’s empowerment 
(not excluding men and youths) in vegetable production by harnessing the potential of socio-tech-nical innovation bundling and in addressing gender inequalities and improve nutrition outcomes through nutrition-sensitive interventions. By integrating technology, social innovation, and gen-der-responsive approaches, this program aims to create an enabling environment for women, men 
and youths to take an active role in decision-making, resource allocation, and nutrition practices.
Motivation
Employing participatory approaches and working with stakeholders at local level in co-designing 
social-technical bundles that work requires capacity on nutrition-sensitive practices and gender-re-sponsive approaches. However, past engagements revealed that there is limited understanding on the approaches, thereby influencing the gender equality and women’s empowerment in agriculture and food systems. Thus, this Training of Trainers (ToT) was an effort towards strengthening the lo-
cal capacity on gender-responsive and nutrition-sensitive for promoting equitable and sustainable 
food systems and engaging men in nutritional activities.
Purpose of the training 
The purpose of the Training of Trainees (ToT) include:1. Enhancing the knowledge and skills of men, youth and women on nutrition-sensitive practices and gender-responsive approaches. 
2. Supporting empowerment of individuals, communities, and institutions to foster healthier eat-ing habits, ensure food security, and promote gender equality. 
3. Strengthening knowledge and skills of youth, men and women to make informed decisions about nutrition, food selection, and meal planning that can improve their own health and the health of their families.Background to the training workshop

TRAINING WORKSHOP ON GENDER-RESPONSIVE AND NUTRITION-SENSITIVE AGRICULTURETECHNICAL REPORT4Participants and format of ToT
52 participants including model farmers, VBN Coaches, experts from agricultural extension, health 
professionals, nutrition officers, experts from children and women’s affairs participated in the ToT. Men and women equally participated (50% each), and youth represented 65.3% of all the participants.
The format of the ToT included brief presentations, group activities, and synthesis of learning. The 
language of instruction was Amharic and Afan Oromo.
Introductory remarks
The ToT has started with rounds of introductions and an introductory remark by Dr. Eileen Nchanji. 
In her remark, Dr. Eileen highlighted the need for understanding gender as a responsibility of men, women, and youth instead of women’s issues. In her remarks, Dr. Eileen demonstrated the need for men and women to work together in addressing challenges of gender inclusion in agriculture in a short drama. 
Overview of the Veggies for Planet and People (V4P&P) project
Mr. Gemechis Jaleta from SNV presented an overview of the Veggies for Planet and People (V4P&P) project. He highlighted that the project aims at creating jobs and income, particularly for youth and women, in the vegetable sector and improving environmental and human health through the safe production of vegetables. He also explained the main intervention or outcome areas of the project: 1) formation and strengthening of VBNs, 2) promotion of regenerative technologies, 3) supporting 
vegetable seed systems, and 4) awareness and demand creation on production and consumption 
of safe vegetables and regenerative technologies. 
He elaborated on the approaches of the Veggies 4 Plant and People project as: Enable people to 
produce and sell a diverse range of vegetables, particularly Traditional African Vegetables (TAVs), support existing/new groups as VBNs aimed at linking farmers to input & output markets, Sustain VBNs through mentoring and coaching and support in marketing, improve vegetable production by introducing technologies to restore, maintain or improve the health of the soil, reduce production costs, and enhance product quality, promote the consumption of vegetables among consumers, and promote the Vegetable seed/seedling business. Then he illustrated on how VBNs were used as 
a market approach in the project, the establishment of VBNs, and the VBNs capacity development. 
He then emphasized on the relevance of demonstration and learning activities and government buy in cascading the capacity development works of the project.
In addition, he emphasized that the training has relevance for cascading the project activities such 
as the agroecological farming practices (i.e. vermicomposting), vegetable business networks, im-

agriculture is timely in strengthening the impact of the project and supporting inclusiveness of the interventions. 
After that, Yidnekachew Zewde from World Vegetable Center complemented the presentation 
highlighting that participants should pay attention to the discussion and suggestions in the ToT as 
we have to shift from the ‘business as usual’ approach of gender as we go beyond the men and women dichotomy. 
Overview of HER+ initiative
Dr. Dessalegn provided an overview on the HER+ initiative and the collaboration with Worldveg and SNV, planned socio-technical bundling activities including introducing and strengthening so-cial innovations with the Lersha platform. In his presentation, Dr. Dessalegn underlined the focus of HER+ initiative in empowering women through Socio-Technical Innovation Bundling (STIB) and Nutrition-Sensitive capacity building Interventions. He elaborated that gender equality and wom-
en’s empowerment, and digital solutions were identified as gaps for adoptions of innovations and 
technologies. 
He pointed out that The Training of Trainers was an effort to address the gaps on gender equality 
and nutrition-sensitive practices. He added that efforts are underway to address the gap in dig-ital solutions in collaborative efforts of HER+ with Lersha platform in facilitating farmers access to STIBs. He elaborated how social-technical bundling looks like with examples, and underlined the need for strengthening capacity on gender responsive and nutrition sensitive approaches for increased impact of the STIBs. 
Further, he added that the HER+ activities focus on Ejere and Welmera weredas for the piloting of 
HER+ activities, and the Woliso wereda will be a control site. The two woredas He highlighted that the STIBs often do not work the same way in different locations, and stated the need for STIBs to be context-specific and introduced the objectives of the ToT. Then, he indicated that the ToT and the follow up cascading activities on gender-responsive and nutrition-sensitive agriculture aimed at strengthening the local capacity for the adoption of innovations and technologies promoted by the Veggies project. In conclusion, he presented the objectives of the workshop and encouraged the participants to actively participate in the training. 
Presentation and discussion on gender-responsive agriculture
Mastewal Yami delivered a presentation on Mainstreaming gender in agriculture and nutrition: Why it Matters. She explained the importance of the agricultural sector for food, income and women’s

TRAINING WORKSHOP ON GENDER-RESPONSIVE AND NUTRITION-SENSITIVE AGRICULTURETECHNICAL REPORT6empowerment, and the contribution of women for agricultural sector. Then, she elaborated on 
women’s constraints in three dimensions: 1) Structural and system barriers such as gender in-equalities in social structures and limited representation of rural women in decision making; 2) Discriminatory social institutions including constraining gender norms, women’s mobility, partici-pation in trainings, group activities, and 3) Power relations such as patriarchal nature of society and 
women’s low level of agency. 
Next, she explained the concept of gender and the need to operationalize the conceptual as-
pects of gender with due consideration of the local context. Then, she elaborated on the meaning of gender mainstreaming and its relevance in agriculture. She emphasized on the need for gen-der-responsive approaches for transformative change in the agricultural sector and for maximizing the positive impact of interventions in agriculture on income and livelihoods of men, women, and youth. She also explained the steps to develop a gender mainstreaming strategy including 1) de-fining the area of responsibility, 2) discussing who is responsible, 3) defining the gender activity timeline, and 4) allocating resources using examples. In the end, she presented an action plan 
template for mainstreaming gender in agriculture. 
The presentation was followed by questions and clarifications, and also discussion by participants 
of the training on experiences on gender equality and women’s empowerment in agriculture. The participants shared interesting insights on how gendered roles and gender norms influenced the efforts to realize gender equality and women’s empowerment in agriculture especially nutrition. 
Presentation and discussion on nutrition-sensitive agriculture
Mr. Abel Ahmed delivered a presentation on nutrition sensitive agriculture.  In his presentation, Abel explained the need to improve nutrition practices and the goal of the ToT in supporting the consumption of nutritious foods for improving the wellbeing of participants and their families, and develop the knowledge and skills of participants on healthy food choices and meal planning. He explained about the meaning of food, the need for consuming food include physiological, psycho-
logical, and social functions. Then, he elaborated on the relevance of food in satisfying hunger, 
supplying energy, protecting health, building tissue and regulation, and the associated religious and cultural values, and social needs with examples. 
After that, he explained about the consequences of malnutrition including stunting, wasting, un-
derweight and overweight in Ethiopia. He explained the malnutrition situation such as nutrient and vitamin deficiency among children and women in Ethiopia, the problems of malnutrition on socio-economic development, and underlined the need to pay attention to nutrition-sensitive agri-culture to address the problem.  He also outlined the practices needed to prevent malnutrition: 1) diet diversification, 2) bio-fortification, 3) food fortification, and 4) supplementation. All these were

In addition, he pointed out the need to mainstream nutrition in the production, marketing and 
consumption of food. He indicated that nutrition-sensitive agriculture requires awareness creation, diversifying food production and consumption, increasing income, prioritizing women and children, 
reducing contamination, food wastages, and proper preparation and preservation of food.

Participants of the ToT formed four groups, and each group comprised of farmers, VBN coaches, 
health experts, nutrition officers, and project staff. In each group, participants discussed the con-straints, opportunities, and lessons in mainstreaming gender-responsive and nutrition-sensitive agriculture. In each group, the key discussion points and insights were documented in flip charts and presented to all the participants. The presentations were followed by questions, clarifications, 
and discussion. The highlights of the presentation are summarized as: 
Constraints for gender-responsive and nutrition sensitive agriculture
• Male dominance and lack of consideration of women’s voices in decision-making processes
• Constraining gender norms and traditional practices limiting women’s empowerment e.g. con-
fidence, decision-making power
• Low level of awareness on gender equality and women’s empowerment
• Poor functioning structures to support gender-responsive and nutrition sensitive agriculture
• Unequal participation of men and women in development activities
• Low level of awareness on production and consumption of nutritious food
• Poor food habits regardless of availability of diverse food items
• Lack of food preparation skills e.g. cooking vegetables
• Shortage and high prices of fruits and vegetables
• Lack of control of chemical use in agriculture
• Low income and education level of rural communities
• Lack of skills in diversification of food production and consumption
Opportunities for gender-responsive and nutrition sensitive agriculture
• Presence of experts at local levels
• Demonstration and trainings on nutrition by different projects
• Promotion of home garden vegetable production
• Increased participation of women in decision-making positions in the government structures

TRAINING WORKSHOP ON GENDER-RESPONSIVE AND NUTRITION-SENSITIVE AGRICULTURETECHNICAL REPORT8• Improved access to education
• Supportive policies and interest of the government in the topic
• Presence of traditional institutions and structures  
• Training opportunities in the governmental and nongovernmental organizations
• Presence of agricultural system with diverse crops and animals
• Increased attention on nutrition
• Favourable climate
• Good access to roads and markets
• Availability of educated human power
Lessons for gender-responsive and nutrition sensitive agriculture
• Increasing the enrolment of children in schools and pregnant women’s utilization of health 
facilities has importance for gender equality, nutrition sensitive agriculture, and the overall wellbeing of rural communities.
• Family planning is critical for mother’s health and healthy child development.
• Gender equality interventions helped in increasing recognition to the contributions of men and 
women in agriculture, and improved participation of women in decision-making processes.
• Increased production and consumption of fruits and vegetables is important for achieving 
nutrition-sensitive agriculture.
• Awareness creation works helped in reducing negative attitudes towards certain food items 
such as Ethiopian collard greens.
Behavior change for gender-responsive and nutrition sensitive agriculture
Mastewal presented on the need for behavior change for gender-responsive and nutrition-sensi-tive agriculture. She highlighted that nutrition is highly linked to agriculture and behavior change is required in the way food is produced and consumed, income is generated and spent, and the use of women’s time and energy.  She underlined the need for interventions in gender-nutrition sensitive agriculture in addressing the immediate and underlying causes of malnutrition. After that, 
she explained the different forms of behavior change (i.e. communication and non-communication 
activities).
Then, she outlined the important steps in effective behavior change design - before, during, and 
after design including 1) identifying the problem: Why a certain issue is occurring, 2) setting goal and define objectives, 3) developing campaign themes and align with related events, 4) identifying the target audience, and 5) deciding on communication channels and messages with examples. After that Abel explained how to design a behavior change for nutrition-sensitive agriculture using examples on mother’s breast feeding, selecting nutritionally-rich crops, and homestead farming.

empowerment, the health and well-being of individuals, communities, and the society. The presen-tations were followed by questions, clarifications and interactive discussion among participants.
Action plans for mainstreaming gender-responsive and nutrition 
sensitive agriculture 
Participants of the ToT formed four groups (2 Welmera, 2 Ejere groups) and developed action plans 
for cascading the training on gender-responsive and nutrition sensitive agriculture. Each group 
composed of farmers, VNB coaches, health experts, and nutrition officers, and the respective 
woreda experts from health and women’s and children affairs offices were assigned to provide technical support for each group. The group formation considered proximity of kebeles for facili-tating implementation and enabling active follow up by the project staff as:
• Ejere woreda: Group 1: Kimoye, Enaftu and Hora kebeles and Group 2:  Ejere, Telbo, Endode, 
Goli, and Amaro kebeles.
• Welmera woreda: Group 1: Welmera Choke, Bekeka, Rob Gebeya and Berfeta 1ffa and Group 2: Markos, Berfeta 2ffa, Duaf Lafto, Gelesu Sida, and Tulu wato Dalechaa kebeles.
The four groups developed action plans for cascading the training on gender-responsive and nu-trition-sensitive agriculture in their respective areas. Each action plan included the gap to be ad-dressed, proposed actions, timing (6 months during January to June, 2024), indicators/targets, 
resource needed, and the expected outcomes in the short-medium, and long-term. Then, the four 
groups presented their action plans and received feedback from the participants for further im-provements. 
Closing remarks
Dr. Dessalegn appreciated the active participation of the ToT participants, the lively discussion and sharing several good questions and responses. He underlined the importance of implementing the good practices discussed during the ToT, and the need for continuous capacity development activities to support women’s empowerment through the STIBs.

This pilot intervention was supported by Google.org and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the intervention is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. The project transferred a lump sum of cash to a treatment group of randomly sampled households when triggered by the climate data risk thresholds. An equal number of comparable households in a control group received the same amount of cash post flooding shock. The main purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of anticipatory cash against the traditional humanitarian post-shocks supporting mechanism. We collected baseline and endline data from a sample of 1450 experimental households (725 ‘treatment’ and 725 ‘control’) and analyzed the data using econometric models. Several outcome indicators including food security, climate adaptive and resilience actions, and wellbeing measures were used to assess the intervention. The results indicate that anticipatory cash has significant impacts on reducing negative coping strategies, increasing the number of pre-emptive climate adaptive actions, and increasing investment in productive assets that could enhance future resilience. On other hand, anticipatory cash transfers do not seem to have significant impacts on short-term food and non-food consumption expenditures compared to post-shock cash transfers. Our findings indicate that one-time large sum anticipatory transfer could lead households to build their climate resilience capacity, and hence a promising intervention to reduce the vulnerability of households to future climate shocks. Based on the findings we have two key recommendations: (1) Given the generally positive findings on household’s welfare and climate resilience capacity, we suggest humanitarian agencies and governments to consider anticipatory interventions (such as pre-shock cash transfers) as a mechanism for both meeting basic needs and improving climate resilience of households provided that quality data and analytics exist to predict a high probability of climate shocks. (2) As climate shocks continue to worsen and humanitarian funding needs remain unmet for both emergencies and early recovery, anticipatory approach may be critical to meeting the short- and long-term needs of climate and conflict-affected households.

 ABSTRACT  
This paper presents the findings from an experimental study designed to assess the impacts of one -time 
large lump sum cash transfers on welfare and coping strategies of smallholders in climate -risk and 
conflict -affected communities in northeast Nigeria. Th is pilot intervention was supported by Google.org 
and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the 
intervention is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the 
financial and so cial resources to act upon that information, they will avoid negative coping strategies and 
build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. The project transferred a lump sum of cash to a 
treatment group of randomly sampled households when trigge red by the climate data risk thresholds. An 
equal number of comparable households in a control group received the same amount of cash post -
flooding shock. The main purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of anticipatory cash against 
the traditional humanitarian post -shocks supporting mechanism. We collected  baseline and endline data 
from a sample of 1450 experimental households (725 ‘treatment’ and 725 ‘control’) and analyzed  the 
data using econometric model s. Several outcome indicators including foo d security, climate adaptive and 
resilience actions, and wellbeing measures were used to assess the intervention. The results indicate 
that anticipatory cash has significant impacts on reducing negative coping strategies, increasing the 
number of pre -empti ve climate adaptive actions, and increasing investment in productive assets that 
could enhance future resilience. On other hand, anticipatory cash transfers do not seem to have 
significant impacts on short -term food and non -food consumption expenditures co mpared to post -shock 
cash transfers. Our findings indicate that one -time large sum anticipatory transfer could lead households 
to build their climate resilience capacity, and hence a promising intervention to reduce the vulnerability 
of households to futur e climate shocks. Based on the findings we have  two key recommendations: (1) 
Given the generally positive findings on household’s welfare and climate resilience capacity, we suggest 
humanitarian agencies and governments to consider anticipatory interventio ns (such as pre -shock cash 
transfers) as a mechanism for both meeting basic needs and  improving climate resilience of households  
provided that quality data and analytics exist to predict  a high probability of climate shocks . (2) As climate 
shocks continue to worsen and humanitarian funding needs remain unmet  for both emerge ncies and 
early recovery , anticipatory approach may be critical to meeting the short - and long -term needs of climate - 
and conflict -affected households.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
The rising frequency and intensity of climate variability and extreme weather events including 
unpredictable rainfall and temperature, flooding, and drought threaten food production, 
livelihoods, and food security of f arm households in sub -Saharan Africa (Di Falco et al., 2011; Di 
Falco and Veronesi, 2013; Hasegawa et al., 2015; Chonabayashi et al., 2020; Kuang et al., 2020; 
Tesfaye and Tirivayi, 2020). According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 
(2021) , frequent and intense floods, droughts and storms account for up to 90 percent of natural 
hazards worldwide. The climate crisis is intersecting with and compounding other drivers of 
severe food crisis , including conflict and economic downturns. Climate ch ange has become the 
primary factor affecting agricultural productivity and is deeply intertwined with food crises in the 
world (Nyathi et al., 2022) . The negative impacts of climate variability and change are felt more in 
developing countries like Nigeri a than the developed world due to limited coping strategies 
available to poorer populations (Adekola and Lamond 2018; Akinloye 2018) and ‘adaptation 
deficits’1to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 2014; Asfaw et 
al., 2018) . Poorer households with fewer livelihood assets, limited coping strategies, and 
dependent on climate sensitive economic activities such as subsistence farming are highly 
vulnerable to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 201 4; Gitz et 
al., 2016; Asfaw et al., 2018; Clarke et al., 2022).  
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to climate -related shocks and ranks high among the countries that 
are susceptible to climate change (Ebele and Emodi, 2016; Elias and Omojola, 2015).  Many 
state s in the country increasingly suffer perennial flooding (Echendu, 2020; 2021) , especially 
during the rainy season which occurs between March and November annually. In 2012, Nigeria 
experienced one of its largest floods in a century, causing the displacem ent of over 2.3 million 
people, 363 deaths, and impacted the livelihoods of over 16 million people (Adekola and Lamond, 
2018; Adelekan and Asiyanbi, 2016; Boamah et al., 2015) . Total economic losses were estimated 
at US$16.9 billion (Tiwari and Tiwari, 2 015). Several studies show that annual flooding has led to 
more displacements than any other climate disaster in Nigeria (Boamah et al., 2015; Echendu, 
2021; Tiwari and Tiwari, 2015; United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(UNOCHA), 2022a) . 
The situation is particularly severe in northeast states of Nigeria that have experienced 
decades of climatic shocks, insecurity , and consequent humanitarian crises (Madu, 2016; Federal 
Ministry of Environment, 2014; Hassan et al., 2019; K amta et al., 2020) . In recent years,  the 
frequency of flooding in the northeastern states Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe has shown significant 
increases. In 2019, these states faced the worst floods in seven years, which affected over 
300,000 people and had ca sualties five times more than those reported in previous years 
(UNOCHA, 2020). More recently, the flooding incidence that followed the 2022 rainy season led 
to loss of life, injuries, and damage to infrastructure, property, and agricultural land thereby 
 
1 Adaptation is generally described as those responses by individuals, groups and governments to climatic change or other stimu li 
that are used to reduce their vulnerability or susceptibility to adverse impacts (Bradshaw et al., 2004). Adaptation deficit entails a 
situation in which a country experiences a lack of institutional, economic, and technological means to facilitate the adaptat ion 
process (Asfaw et al., 2018).

 impacting livelihoods and food security (UNOCHA, 2022) . A study on the effects of recent flooding 
in Nigeria shows that Adamawa state is among the most affected states with an estimated 
260,000 people exposed to floods and around a 1,000 km2 of land submer ged across the state 
(REACH Initiative , 2022) . This is attributed to heavy rainfalls (average of above 2000 mm and can 
reach 4000 mm in southern Nigeria) between the months of July and October 2022 (as compared 
to the overall annual average of 1000 mm) t hat caused an overflow of the Lagdo dam in 
neighboring Cameroon and increased flow of the Benue River. Besides climate variability, 
protracted and frequent violen t conflicts including the Boko Haram insurgenc e and herder -farmer  
conflicts  further disrupt ag ricultural activities and food supply chains that worsen food insecurity 
and malnutrition (Obi and Eboreime, 2017;  Baliki et al., 2018; Adelaja and George, 2019) . 
As climate shocks have become increasingly prevalent, governments and humanitarian 
organizations have stepped in to provide time -bound support to those worst affected. This support 
can take the form of food aid, temporary shelter, or basic services, but in creasingly, support is 
provided in the form of one -off cash transfers (Dietrich and Schmerzeck, 2019; Ferraro and 
Simorangkir, 2020 ; Pople et al., 2021 ). However, most humanitarian aid s largely focus on 
responding to post -shock crises (Nobre et al., 2019; Pichon, 2019; Levine et al., 2020) . This has 
raised a need for early/anticipatory actions to improve household preparedness and limit the 
devastating long -term impacts of climate shocks. If targeted properly, anticipatory actions can 
potentially help hou seholds to better prepare and respond to climate shocks, reduce vulnerability, 
and increase household resilience to shock (de Perez et al. 2015, Gros et al. 2022) .  
Findings from few existing studies indicate the positive impacts of anticipatory actions on 
various household level outcomes. Examples include a simulation -based study of anticipatory 
interventions on household level outcomes (Giuffrida et al., 2017); evaluation of the costs, benefits 
and returns on investment of ex -ante actions compared to ex -post responses (Gros et al., 2019; 
Nobre et al., 2019) ; and assessments of the impacts of anticipatory cash transfers on household 
welfare (Gros et al., 2019; Tanner et al., 2019; Hill et al., 2019; People et al., 2021). However, 
most of the existing st udies on the benefits  or impacts of anticipatory actions are based on either 
observational or quasi -experimental data (Levine et al., 2020; Pople et al., 2021) . There is limited 
randomized experimental evaluations of the impact of anticipatory cash trans fers in response to 
forecast based climatic shocks in the humanitarian sector (Puri et al., 2017; Levine et al., 2020; 
Pople et al., 2021) . We attribute this dearth of empirical evidence to various factors. First, it is 
difficult to justify the ethics of  a randomized control trial in life -or-death situations. Second, the 
need for speed with the lack of transparency in implementation obfuscates the identification of a 
valid counterfactual. Third, it is challenging to conduct a baseline when it is unknown a  priori 
where a disaster will strike, particularly since disasters ex -post disrupt the supply of basic services 
and infrastructure, including those needed for data collection. As a result, little is known on the 
impacts of cash transfers beyond the immedia te consumption support they provide, and how their 
impact is affected by their timing and targeting (Pople et al., 2021) .  
We study the differential impacts of anticipatory vs. post -shock one -off lump sum cash 
transfers for a fast onset climate shock (fl ooding) by randomly assigning the eligible population in 
anticipatory and post -shock cash transfer treatment groups. Thus, recipients of post -shock cash 
transfers are considered as ‘controls’ against the anticipatory cash recipients ‘treatment’ group. 
Our present study thus has several distinguishing features compared to past studies: (1) Data

 has come from a randomized experiment against observational or quasi -experimental studies 
such as that of Pople et al. (2021) where the identification strategy was ba sed on exogenous 
variations in administrative constraints. (2) We collected data through in -person surveys 
compared to phone interviews. In -person surveys improve data quality and enable the collection 
of more detailed information than phone interviews. (3 ) Unlike past studies that considered only 
a few welfare indicators (Gros et al, 2019) or the cost -effectiveness of ex -ante actions (Nobre et 
al., 2019), our study included several measures of welfare including the short -term food 
consumption score (FCS), reduced coping strategy index (rCSI), livelihood coping strategy index 
(LCSI), and wellbeing indicators. (4) With the exception of Pople et al. (2021) , many studies had 
imbalanced counterfactuals and used relatively small sample sizes. Our study is based  on a 
balanced counterfactual and a relatively large sample size of 1450 study households.  
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the welfare and other household level impacts 
of this anticipatory cash transfers against the conventional post -shock approach of cash transfers. 
Based on the balance test, our samples are well balanced across the pre - and post -shock groups, 
showing that the two groups are comparable across major socio -demographic variables 
measured at the baseline. Thus, our research design enables us to generate valid counterfactuals 
to assess anticipatory cash transfer as against post -shock cash. To the best of our knowledge, 
the present cash transfer intervention design is the first of its kind in cash transfer experimental 
design i mplemented in a conflict -prone environment that combined an anticipatory action with a 
conventional post -shock humanitarian response.  
The remaining parts of the paper  are organized as follows. Section 2 provides the description 
of ‘cash for climate resili ence’ intervention. The study methods including research design, data 
collection and econometric strategies are presented in section 3.  Sections 4 and 5 respectively 
present descriptive and econometric results. The last section concludes the paper with so me 
policy recommendations.  
2. THE ‘CASH FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE’ INTERVENTION  
The International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) global mission is to help people whose lives and 
livelihoods are shattered by conflict and disaster, including the climate crisis, to sur vive, recover 
and gain control of their future. The IRC and Google.org have formed a partnership in Nigeria to 
catalyze a transformation in humanitarian preparedness and response to complex climate crises, 
investing in foundational innovations to create ne w products and services, as well as research to 
understand what works. This partnership is expected to advance innovations in responding to 
climate change induced risks for conflict - and crisis -affected people by integrating predictive 
analytics with cash assistance that will result in improved coping strategies, increased capacity 
for decision making, and more diversified  and profitable livelihoods. The goals of the intervention 
project include:  
1. Intervention : To reduce the use of negative coping strategies and support households to 
build resilience against climate shocks by providing climate risk reduction payments and early 
warning messaging to smallholder farmers.    
Page 9:

 2. Research : To assess the effectiveness of use of early warning systems and impacts of antic-
ipatory cash transfers versus post -shock cash transfers to mitigate the level of shock and 
stress experienced by smallholde r farmers in the event of a hazardous climatic event . 
3. Expected o utcome : Households reduce the use of negative coping strategies, improve food 
security and income, and build resilience to climatic shocks.  
The IRC’s central hypothesis is that when climate vu lnerable communities have timely access 
to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid 
negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. Community 
members are acute ly aware of how their environment is changing due to climate change, and 
these communities are rich with knowledge on climate change adaptation and mitigation 
measures. However, resource constrained communities lack effective systems to disseminate 
real-time information about climate risks and their potential severity and many households in 
resource constrained environments do not possess the financial means to implement adaptive or 
mitigation measures that would allow them to protect or adapt their livelih oods during a stress 
and/or shock. This is especially true in conflict -affected communities, where a lack of social 
cohesion and inter -community economic linkages can exacerbate vulnerabilities.  
To test this hypothesis, the IRC piloted the climate risk red uction payments in Adamawa state 
in northeast Nigeria with smallholder farmers and livestock owners. The project adopted a 
systems approach, working within and with the existing ICT systems (radio, SMS, voice, mobile, 
etc.), agriculture extension providers , and other key stakeholders within the government and 
community. The pilot project transferred a lump sum of anticipatory cash payments to a sample 
of 725 flood -prone households when triggered by the climate data platform risk thresholds. As 
controls to t his anticipatory cash transfer, an equal number of comparable households (‘control 
group’) received equal amount of cash payments post flooding shock. All households received 
early warning messages prior to the floods through community -based early warning workers. The 
pilot intervention/study focused on flooding because it is a predictable climatic shock with 
available well -established prediction data compared to other climate shocks.  
3. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
3.1 The s tudy area 
The project was implemented in Fufore Local Government Area (LGA) of Adamawa state, 
northeast Nigeria  situated between latitude 90 131 North and longitude 120 391 East (Figure 1) . 
Fufore  has a total land area of about 5,169 km2 with an estimated population of 2 07,286 
inhabitants  (National Bureau of Statistics,  2010). The area experiences distinct dry and wet 
seasons with temperature and humidity varying with season. The wet season is between April 
and October with an average annual rainfall of 750 to 1000mm. The  dry season period is between 
December and March and characterized by dry, dusty, and hazy northeast trade winds that blow 
over the area from Sahara Desert. Temperatures are relatively high almost all the year round, 
reaching about 420C during the dry seas on. The area is drained by a series of rivers and streams 
such as River Benue which takes its source from Cameroon, River Faro, and Ine., which all 
Page 10:

 encourage arable cropping, livestock rearing, and fishing. The major crops cultivated include 
millet, rice, beans, soyabean, and sorghum.     
Based on flooding severity, six communities situated close to the River Benue floodplain, Faro 
River and the Ladgo dam in Cameroon were targeted. These communities include Dulobwatiye, 
Ribado, Dasin_Hausa, Farangfarang, Ric o and Gembiusi. Most rural households  in Fofure LGA 
depend on the floodplain along the Upper River Benue for their agricultural production due to 
water availability during the off -season.  Although the floodplains are suitable for cultivation in the 
off-season, these farmers are exposed to flooding risk in the main rain y season and vulnerable to 
the impact of climate change. IRC’s assessment had identified r ecurrent flooding as a major 
hazard due to its impact on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

 3.2 Readiness and activation triggers for cash payments  
The IRC collaborated with the Nigeria Hydrological Service Agency (NiHSA), the Nigeria 
Meteorological Agency (NiMET) and the Upper Benue Basin D evelopment Authority (UBBDA) to 
set forecast -based thresholds and provide evidence on hydrological  and meteorological 
parameters for triggering anticipatory cash payments. The collaboration focused on real -time 
monitoring of water level, discharge, and rai nfall, data sharing, and early warning information 
dissemination to inform anticipatory action. These parameters were selected and monitored from 
existing gauge stations close to the communities of intervention. The analytics, data, thresholds 
set for these parameters and detailed descriptions of setting the thresholds are provided in Annex 
1.

The intervention also includes early warning messages by ten trained and experienced 
community early warning volunteers selected from the National Emergency Management Agency 
(NEMA), the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Fufore LGA, and community 
leaders (see Annex 2 for the contents of early warning messages). The volunteers were trained 
in the warning systems of disaster risk r eduction messaging, early action, and climate smart 
adaptation. This included information on planting early, use of drought resilient crops varieties, 
and early harvesting.  
3.3 Anticipatory and post -shock cash payments   
On 27 July 2022, the IRC provided a pre -shock cash transfer of N195,000 (~400 USD) to 725 
households (‘treatment group’) across the six communities in anticipation of the impending 
flooding. At the time of the cash distribution, the flash flooding water had cut -off three of the six

 study c ommunities (Dulobatiye, Farang -Farang and Rico) from accessing to the main transport 
route. These communities were no longer accessible by vehicle or motor bike, leaving wooden 
boat as the alternative means of transport. Figure 4 presents the schematic pro cesses through 
which forecast -based anticipatory cash distribution decisions were made and implemented. An 
equal number of households i.e., 725 randomly assigned households (‘control group’) received 
same cash payments on 7 November 2022 after the flood re ceded and access was manageable.

3.4 Sampling frame and sample selection   
To construct a sampling frame from which to select participants for the intervention, the IRC 
conducted a blanket registration of all households in the six communities identified as the most 
historically affected by floods and climatic shocks in Fufore LGA . The registration process resulted 
in 2,095 households eligible for selection. Once the sampling frame was constructed, 1 ,450 
participants were selected using stratified random sampling with proportional allocation by 
community and gender. The sample func tion in R statistical software was used to randomly select 
household IDs with equal probability from the pool of eligible men and women within each 
community (Table 1).

3.5 Data Collection  
Baseline data were collected from the sample of 1450 experimental households before the 
intervention. Interviews were conducted by ten enumerators conversant with both the English and 
local Hausa language. Enumerators were provided rigorous fac e-to-face training on the study 
design, survey protocol, and research ethics. The endline survey was conducted with the same 
households five months after the implementation of the baseline survey. The questionnaires for 
both baseline and endline surveys we re pre -tested in a suburb of Yola town that were not part of 
the study communities. Surveys were conducted in -person and at the end of each survey day, 
enumerators uploaded the data to the server and senior researchers undertook quality checks. 
Debriefs we re held either at the end of the day or the start of the following day.  
Baseline data collection took place over a 17 -day period between 25 April and 31 May 2022. 
Since Ramadan had ended close to when baseline data collection was due to start, the survey 
was first administered in the majority of Christian communities and to re duce response bias a 
seven -day recall period was used for food security related questions. Some cross -checking 
questions were added to capture whether the household had recently been fasting. Similar field 
planning and survey administration procedures were  pursued for the endline data collection 
administered in December 2022, five months after the baseline survey. A larger pool of 
enumerators (twenty) was used for endline survey to complete data collection before the 2022 
Christmas holiday.

This pilot intervention was supported by Google.org and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the intervention is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. The project transferred a lump sum of cash to a treatment group of randomly sampled households when triggered by the climate data risk thresholds. An equal number of comparable households in a control group received the same amount of cash post flooding shock. The main purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of anticipatory cash against the traditional humanitarian post-shocks supporting mechanism. We collected baseline and endline data from a sample of 1450 experimental households (725 ‘treatment’ and 725 ‘control’) and analyzed the data using econometric models. Several outcome indicators including food security, climate adaptive and resilience actions, and wellbeing measures were used to assess the intervention. The results indicate that anticipatory cash has significant impacts on reducing negative coping strategies, increasing the number of pre-emptive climate adaptive actions, and increasing investment in productive assets that could enhance future resilience. On other hand, anticipatory cash transfers do not seem to have significant impacts on short-term food and non-food consumption expenditures compared to post-shock cash transfers. Our findings indicate that one-time large sum anticipatory transfer could lead households to build their climate resilience capacity, and hence a promising intervention to reduce the vulnerability of households to future climate shocks. Based on the findings we have two key recommendations: (1) Given the generally positive findings on household’s welfare and climate resilience capacity, we suggest humanitarian agencies and governments to consider anticipatory interventions (such as pre-shock cash transfers) as a mechanism for both meeting basic needs and improving climate resilience of households provided that quality data and analytics exist to predict a high probability of climate shocks. (2) As climate shocks continue to worsen and humanitarian funding needs remain unmet for both emergencies and early recovery, anticipatory approach may be critical to meeting the short- and long-term needs of climate and conflict-affected households.

 ABSTRACT  
This paper presents the findings from an experimental study designed to assess the impacts of one -time 
large lump sum cash transfers on welfare and coping strategies of smallholders in climate -risk and 
conflict -affected communities in northeast Nigeria. Th is pilot intervention was supported by Google.org 
and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the 
intervention is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the

treatment group of randomly sampled households when trigge red by the climate data risk thresholds. An 
equal number of comparable households in a control group received the same amount of cash post -
flooding shock. The main purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of anticipatory cash against 
the traditional humanitarian post -shocks supporting mechanism. We collected  baseline and endline data 
from a sample of 1450 experimental households (725 ‘treatment’ and 725 ‘control’) and analyzed  the

 1. INTRODUCTION  
The rising frequency and intensity of climate variability and extreme weather events including 
unpredictable rainfall and temperature, flooding, and drought threaten food production, 
livelihoods, and food security of f arm households in sub -Saharan Africa (Di Falco et al., 2011; Di 
Falco and Veronesi, 2013; Hasegawa et al., 2015; Chonabayashi et al., 2020; Kuang et al., 2020; 
Tesfaye and Tirivayi, 2020). According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 
(2021) , frequent and intense floods, droughts and storms account for up to 90 percent of natural 
hazards worldwide. The climate crisis is intersecting with and compounding other drivers of 
severe food crisis , including conflict and economic downturns. Climate ch ange has become the 
primary factor affecting agricultural productivity and is deeply intertwined with food crises in the 
world (Nyathi et al., 2022) . The negative impacts of climate variability and change are felt more in 
developing countries like Nigeri a than the developed world due to limited coping strategies 
available to poorer populations (Adekola and Lamond 2018; Akinloye 2018) and ‘adaptation 
deficits’1to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 2014; Asfaw et 
al., 2018) . Poorer households with fewer livelihood assets, limited coping strategies, and 
dependent on climate sensitive economic activities such as subsistence farming are highly 
vulnerable to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 201 4; Gitz et 
al., 2016; Asfaw et al., 2018; Clarke et al., 2022).  
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to climate -related shocks and ranks high among the countries that 
are susceptible to climate change (Ebele and Emodi, 2016; Elias and Omojola, 2015).  Many 
state s in the country increasingly suffer perennial flooding (Echendu, 2020; 2021) , especially 
during the rainy season which occurs between March and November annually. In 2012, Nigeria 
experienced one of its largest floods in a century, causing the displacem ent of over 2.3 million 
people, 363 deaths, and impacted the livelihoods of over 16 million people (Adekola and Lamond, 
2018; Adelekan and Asiyanbi, 2016; Boamah et al., 2015) . Total economic losses were estimated 
at US$16.9 billion (Tiwari and Tiwari, 2 015). Several studies show that annual flooding has led to 
more displacements than any other climate disaster in Nigeria (Boamah et al., 2015; Echendu, 
2021; Tiwari and Tiwari, 2015; United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(UNOCHA), 2022a) . 
The situation is particularly severe in northeast states of Nigeria that have experienced 
decades of climatic shocks, insecurity , and consequent humanitarian crises (Madu, 2016; Federal 
Ministry of Environment, 2014; Hassan et al., 2019; K amta et al., 2020) . In recent years,  the 
frequency of flooding in the northeastern states Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe has shown significant 
increases. In 2019, these states faced the worst floods in seven years, which affected over 
300,000 people and had ca sualties five times more than those reported in previous years 
(UNOCHA, 2020). More recently, the flooding incidence that followed the 2022 rainy season led 
to loss of life, injuries, and damage to infrastructure, property, and agricultural land thereby 
 
1 Adaptation is generally described as those responses by individuals, groups and governments to climatic change or other stimu li 
that are used to reduce their vulnerability or susceptibility to adverse impacts (Bradshaw et al., 2004). Adaptation deficit entails a 
situation in which a country experiences a lack of institutional, economic, and technological means to facilitate the adaptat ion 
process (Asfaw et al., 2018).

 impacting livelihoods and food security (UNOCHA, 2022) . A study on the effects of recent flooding 
in Nigeria shows that Adamawa state is among the most affected states with an estimated 
260,000 people exposed to floods and around a 1,000 km2 of land submer ged across the state 
(REACH Initiative , 2022) . This is attributed to heavy rainfalls (average of above 2000 mm and can 
reach 4000 mm in southern Nigeria) between the months of July and October 2022 (as compared 
to the overall annual average of 1000 mm) t hat caused an overflow of the Lagdo dam in 
neighboring Cameroon and increased flow of the Benue River. Besides climate variability, 
protracted and frequent violen t conflicts including the Boko Haram insurgenc e and herder -farmer  
conflicts  further disrupt ag ricultural activities and food supply chains that worsen food insecurity 
and malnutrition (Obi and Eboreime, 2017;  Baliki et al., 2018; Adelaja and George, 2019) . 
As climate shocks have become increasingly prevalent, governments and humanitarian 
organizations have stepped in to provide time -bound support to those worst affected. This support 
can take the form of food aid, temporary shelter, or basic services, but in creasingly, support is 
provided in the form of one -off cash transfers (Dietrich and Schmerzeck, 2019; Ferraro and 
Simorangkir, 2020 ; Pople et al., 2021 ). However, most humanitarian aid s largely focus on 
responding to post -shock crises (Nobre et al., 2019; Pichon, 2019; Levine et al., 2020) . This has 
raised a need for early/anticipatory actions to improve household preparedness and limit the 
devastating long -term impacts of climate shocks. If targeted properly, anticipatory actions can 
potentially help hou seholds to better prepare and respond to climate shocks, reduce vulnerability, 
and increase household resilience to shock (de Perez et al. 2015, Gros et al. 2022) .  
Findings from few existing studies indicate the positive impacts of anticipatory actions on 
various household level outcomes. Examples include a simulation -based study of anticipatory 
interventions on household level outcomes (Giuffrida et al., 2017); evaluation of the costs, benefits 
and returns on investment of ex -ante actions compared to ex -post responses (Gros et al., 2019; 
Nobre et al., 2019) ; and assessments of the impacts of anticipatory cash transfers on household 
welfare (Gros et al., 2019; Tanner et al., 2019; Hill et al., 2019; People et al., 2021). However, 
most of the existing st udies on the benefits  or impacts of anticipatory actions are based on either 
observational or quasi -experimental data (Levine et al., 2020; Pople et al., 2021) . There is limited 
randomized experimental evaluations of the impact of anticipatory cash trans fers in response to 
forecast based climatic shocks in the humanitarian sector (Puri et al., 2017; Levine et al., 2020; 
Pople et al., 2021) . We attribute this dearth of empirical evidence to various factors. First, it is 
difficult to justify the ethics of  a randomized control trial in life -or-death situations. Second, the 
need for speed with the lack of transparency in implementation obfuscates the identification of a 
valid counterfactual. Third, it is challenging to conduct a baseline when it is unknown a  priori 
where a disaster will strike, particularly since disasters ex -post disrupt the supply of basic services 
and infrastructure, including those needed for data collection. As a result, little is known on the 
impacts of cash transfers beyond the immedia te consumption support they provide, and how their 
impact is affected by their timing and targeting (Pople et al., 2021) .  
We study the differential impacts of anticipatory vs. post -shock one -off lump sum cash 
transfers for a fast onset climate shock (fl ooding) by randomly assigning the eligible population in 
anticipatory and post -shock cash transfer treatment groups. Thus, recipients of post -shock cash 
transfers are considered as ‘controls’ against the anticipatory cash recipients ‘treatment’ group. 
Our present study thus has several distinguishing features compared to past studies: (1) Data

 has come from a randomized experiment against observational or quasi -experimental studies 
such as that of Pople et al. (2021) where the identification strategy was ba sed on exogenous 
variations in administrative constraints. (2) We collected data through in -person surveys 
compared to phone interviews. In -person surveys improve data quality and enable the collection 
of more detailed information than phone interviews. (3 ) Unlike past studies that considered only 
a few welfare indicators (Gros et al, 2019) or the cost -effectiveness of ex -ante actions (Nobre et 
al., 2019), our study included several measures of welfare including the short -term food 
consumption score (FCS), reduced coping strategy index (rCSI), livelihood coping strategy index 
(LCSI), and wellbeing indicators. (4) With the exception of Pople et al. (2021) , many studies had 
imbalanced counterfactuals and used relatively small sample sizes. Our study is based  on a 
balanced counterfactual and a relatively large sample size of 1450 study households.  
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the welfare and other household level impacts 
of this anticipatory cash transfers against the conventional post -shock approach of cash transfers. 
Based on the balance test, our samples are well balanced across the pre - and post -shock groups, 
showing that the two groups are comparable across major socio -demographic variables 
measured at the baseline. Thus, our research design enables us to generate valid counterfactuals 
to assess anticipatory cash transfer as against post -shock cash. To the best of our knowledge, 
the present cash transfer intervention design is the first of its kind in cash transfer experimental 
design i mplemented in a conflict -prone environment that combined an anticipatory action with a 
conventional post -shock humanitarian response.  
The remaining parts of the paper  are organized as follows. Section 2 provides the description 
of ‘cash for climate resili ence’ intervention. The study methods including research design, data 
collection and econometric strategies are presented in section 3.  Sections 4 and 5 respectively 
present descriptive and econometric results. The last section concludes the paper with so me 
policy recommendations.  
2. THE ‘CASH FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE’ INTERVENTION  
The International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) global mission is to help people whose lives and 
livelihoods are shattered by conflict and disaster, including the climate crisis, to sur vive, recover 
and gain control of their future. The IRC and Google.org have formed a partnership in Nigeria to 
catalyze a transformation in humanitarian preparedness and response to complex climate crises, 
investing in foundational innovations to create ne w products and services, as well as research to 
understand what works. This partnership is expected to advance innovations in responding to 
climate change induced risks for conflict - and crisis -affected people by integrating predictive 
analytics with cash assistance that will result in improved coping strategies, increased capacity 
for decision making, and more diversified  and profitable livelihoods. The goals of the intervention 
project include:  
1. Intervention : To reduce the use of negative coping strategies and support households to 
build resilience against climate shocks by providing climate risk reduction payments and early 
warning messaging to smallholder farmers.    
Page 9:

 2. Research : To assess the effectiveness of use of early warning systems and impacts of antic-
ipatory cash transfers versus post -shock cash transfers to mitigate the level of shock and 
stress experienced by smallholde r farmers in the event of a hazardous climatic event . 
3. Expected o utcome : Households reduce the use of negative coping strategies, improve food 
security and income, and build resilience to climatic shocks.  
The IRC’s central hypothesis is that when climate vu lnerable communities have timely access 
to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid 
negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. Community 
members are acute ly aware of how their environment is changing due to climate change, and 
these communities are rich with knowledge on climate change adaptation and mitigation 
measures. However, resource constrained communities lack effective systems to disseminate 
real-time information about climate risks and their potential severity and many households in 
resource constrained environments do not possess the financial means to implement adaptive or 
mitigation measures that would allow them to protect or adapt their livelih oods during a stress 
and/or shock. This is especially true in conflict -affected communities, where a lack of social 
cohesion and inter -community economic linkages can exacerbate vulnerabilities.  
To test this hypothesis, the IRC piloted the climate risk red uction payments in Adamawa state 
in northeast Nigeria with smallholder farmers and livestock owners. The project adopted a 
systems approach, working within and with the existing ICT systems (radio, SMS, voice, mobile, 
etc.), agriculture extension providers , and other key stakeholders within the government and 
community. The pilot project transferred a lump sum of anticipatory cash payments to a sample 
of 725 flood -prone households when triggered by the climate data platform risk thresholds. As 
controls to t his anticipatory cash transfer, an equal number of comparable households (‘control 
group’) received equal amount of cash payments post flooding shock. All households received 
early warning messages prior to the floods through community -based early warning workers. The 
pilot intervention/study focused on flooding because it is a predictable climatic shock with 
available well -established prediction data compared to other climate shocks.  
3. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
3.1 The s tudy area 
The project was implemented in Fufore Local Government Area (LGA) of Adamawa state, 
northeast Nigeria  situated between latitude 90 131 North and longitude 120 391 East (Figure 1) . 
Fufore  has a total land area of about 5,169 km2 with an estimated population of 2 07,286 
inhabitants  (National Bureau of Statistics,  2010). The area experiences distinct dry and wet 
seasons with temperature and humidity varying with season. The wet season is between April 
and October with an average annual rainfall of 750 to 1000mm. The  dry season period is between 
December and March and characterized by dry, dusty, and hazy northeast trade winds that blow 
over the area from Sahara Desert. Temperatures are relatively high almost all the year round, 
reaching about 420C during the dry seas on. The area is drained by a series of rivers and streams 
such as River Benue which takes its source from Cameroon, River Faro, and Ine., which all 
Page 10:

 encourage arable cropping, livestock rearing, and fishing. The major crops cultivated include 
millet, rice, beans, soyabean, and sorghum.     
Based on flooding severity, six communities situated close to the River Benue floodplain, Faro 
River and the Ladgo dam in Cameroon were targeted. These communities include Dulobwatiye, 
Ribado, Dasin_Hausa, Farangfarang, Ric o and Gembiusi. Most rural households  in Fofure LGA 
depend on the floodplain along the Upper River Benue for their agricultural production due to 
water availability during the off -season.  Although the floodplains are suitable for cultivation in the 
off-season, these farmers are exposed to flooding risk in the main rain y season and vulnerable to 
the impact of climate change. IRC’s assessment had identified r ecurrent flooding as a major 
hazard due to its impact on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

 3.2 Readiness and activation triggers for cash payments  
The IRC collaborated with the Nigeria Hydrological Service Agency (NiHSA), the Nigeria 
Meteorological Agency (NiMET) and the Upper Benue Basin D evelopment Authority (UBBDA) to 
set forecast -based thresholds and provide evidence on hydrological  and meteorological 
parameters for triggering anticipatory cash payments. The collaboration focused on real -time 
monitoring of water level, discharge, and rai nfall, data sharing, and early warning information 
dissemination to inform anticipatory action. These parameters were selected and monitored from 
existing gauge stations close to the communities of intervention. The analytics, data, thresholds 
set for these parameters and detailed descriptions of setting the thresholds are provided in Annex 
1.

The intervention also includes early warning messages by ten trained and experienced 
community early warning volunteers selected from the National Emergency Management Agency 
(NEMA), the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Fufore LGA, and community 
leaders (see Annex 2 for the contents of early warning messages). The volunteers were trained 
in the warning systems of disaster risk r eduction messaging, early action, and climate smart 
adaptation. This included information on planting early, use of drought resilient crops varieties, 
and early harvesting.  
3.3 Anticipatory and post -shock cash payments   
On 27 July 2022, the IRC provided a pre -shock cash transfer of N195,000 (~400 USD) to 725 
households (‘treatment group’) across the six communities in anticipation of the impending 
flooding. At the time of the cash distribution, the flash flooding water had cut -off three of the six

route. These communities were no longer accessible by vehicle or motor bike, leaving wooden 
boat as the alternative means of transport. Figure 4 presents the schematic pro cesses through 
which forecast -based anticipatory cash distribution decisions were made and implemented. An 
equal number of households i.e., 725 randomly assigned households (‘control group’) received 
same cash payments on 7 November 2022 after the flood re ceded and access was manageable.

3.4 Sampling frame and sample selection   
To construct a sampling frame from which to select participants for the intervention, the IRC 
conducted a blanket registration of all households in the six communities identified as the most 
historically affected by floods and climatic shocks in Fufore LGA . The registration process resulted 
in 2,095 households eligible for selection. Once the sampling frame was constructed, 1 ,450 
participants were selected using stratified random sampling with proportional allocation by 
community and gender. The sample func tion in R statistical software was used to randomly select 
household IDs with equal probability from the pool of eligible men and women within each 
community (Table 1).

3.5 Data Collection  
Baseline data were collected from the sample of 1450 experimental households before the 
intervention. Interviews were conducted by ten enumerators conversant with both the English and 
local Hausa language. Enumerators were provided rigorous fac e-to-face training on the study 
design, survey protocol, and research ethics. The endline survey was conducted with the same 
households five months after the implementation of the baseline survey. The questionnaires for 
both baseline and endline surveys we re pre -tested in a suburb of Yola town that were not part of 
the study communities. Surveys were conducted in -person and at the end of each survey day, 
enumerators uploaded the data to the server and senior researchers undertook quality checks. 
Debriefs we re held either at the end of the day or the start of the following day.  
Baseline data collection took place over a 17 -day period between 25 April and 31 May 2022. 
Since Ramadan had ended close to when baseline data collection was due to start, the survey 
was first administered in the majority of Christian communities and to re duce response bias a 
seven -day recall period was used for food security related questions. Some cross -checking 
questions were added to capture whether the household had recently been fasting. Similar field 
planning and survey administration procedures were  pursued for the endline data collection 
administered in December 2022, five months after the baseline survey. A larger pool of 
enumerators (twenty) was used for endline survey to complete data collection before the 2022 
Christmas holiday.

This pilot intervention was supported by Google.org and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the intervention is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. The project transferred a lump sum of cash to a treatment group of randomly sampled households when triggered by the climate data risk thresholds. An equal number of comparable households in a control group received the same amount of cash post flooding shock. The main purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of anticipatory cash against the traditional humanitarian post-shocks supporting mechanism. We collected baseline and endline data from a sample of 1450 experimental households (725 ‘treatment’ and 725 ‘control’) and analyzed the data using econometric models. Several outcome indicators including food security, climate adaptive and resilience actions, and wellbeing measures were used to assess the intervention. The results indicate that anticipatory cash has significant impacts on reducing negative coping strategies, increasing the number of pre-emptive climate adaptive actions, and increasing investment in productive assets that could enhance future resilience. On other hand, anticipatory cash transfers do not seem to have significant impacts on short-term food and non-food consumption expenditures compared to post-shock cash transfers. Our findings indicate that one-time large sum anticipatory transfer could lead households to build their climate resilience capacity, and hence a promising intervention to reduce the vulnerability of households to future climate shocks. Based on the findings we have two key recommendations: (1) Given the generally positive findings on household’s welfare and climate resilience capacity, we suggest humanitarian agencies and governments to consider anticipatory interventions (such as pre-shock cash transfers) as a mechanism for both meeting basic needs and improving climate resilience of households provided that quality data and analytics exist to predict a high probability of climate shocks. (2) As climate shocks continue to worsen and humanitarian funding needs remain unmet for both emergencies and early recovery, anticipatory approach may be critical to meeting the short- and long-term needs of climate and conflict-affected households.

 ABSTRACT  
This paper presents the findings from an experimental study designed to assess the impacts of one -time 
large lump sum cash transfers on welfare and coping strategies of smallholders in climate -risk and 
conflict -affected communities in northeast Nigeria. Th is pilot intervention was supported by Google.org 
and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the 
intervention is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the

equal number of comparable households in a control group received the same amount of cash post -

 1. INTRODUCTION  
The rising frequency and intensity of climate variability and extreme weather events including 
unpredictable rainfall and temperature, flooding, and drought threaten food production, 
livelihoods, and food security of f arm households in sub -Saharan Africa (Di Falco et al., 2011; Di 
Falco and Veronesi, 2013; Hasegawa et al., 2015; Chonabayashi et al., 2020; Kuang et al., 2020; 
Tesfaye and Tirivayi, 2020). According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 
(2021) , frequent and intense floods, droughts and storms account for up to 90 percent of natural 
hazards worldwide. The climate crisis is intersecting with and compounding other drivers of 
severe food crisis , including conflict and economic downturns. Climate ch ange has become the 
primary factor affecting agricultural productivity and is deeply intertwined with food crises in the 
world (Nyathi et al., 2022) . The negative impacts of climate variability and change are felt more in 
developing countries like Nigeri a than the developed world due to limited coping strategies 
available to poorer populations (Adekola and Lamond 2018; Akinloye 2018) and ‘adaptation 
deficits’1to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 2014; Asfaw et 
al., 2018) . Poorer households with fewer livelihood assets, limited coping strategies, and 
dependent on climate sensitive economic activities such as subsistence farming are highly 
vulnerable to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 201 4; Gitz et 
al., 2016; Asfaw et al., 2018; Clarke et al., 2022).  
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to climate -related shocks and ranks high among the countries that 
are susceptible to climate change (Ebele and Emodi, 2016; Elias and Omojola, 2015).  Many 
state s in the country increasingly suffer perennial flooding (Echendu, 2020; 2021) , especially 
during the rainy season which occurs between March and November annually. In 2012, Nigeria 
experienced one of its largest floods in a century, causing the displacem ent of over 2.3 million 
people, 363 deaths, and impacted the livelihoods of over 16 million people (Adekola and Lamond, 
2018; Adelekan and Asiyanbi, 2016; Boamah et al., 2015) . Total economic losses were estimated 
at US$16.9 billion (Tiwari and Tiwari, 2 015). Several studies show that annual flooding has led to 
more displacements than any other climate disaster in Nigeria (Boamah et al., 2015; Echendu, 
2021; Tiwari and Tiwari, 2015; United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(UNOCHA), 2022a) . 
The situation is particularly severe in northeast states of Nigeria that have experienced 
decades of climatic shocks, insecurity , and consequent humanitarian crises (Madu, 2016; Federal 
Ministry of Environment, 2014; Hassan et al., 2019; K amta et al., 2020) . In recent years,  the 
frequency of flooding in the northeastern states Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe has shown significant 
increases. In 2019, these states faced the worst floods in seven years, which affected over 
300,000 people and had ca sualties five times more than those reported in previous years 
(UNOCHA, 2020). More recently, the flooding incidence that followed the 2022 rainy season led 
to loss of life, injuries, and damage to infrastructure, property, and agricultural land thereby 
 
1 Adaptation is generally described as those responses by individuals, groups and governments to climatic change or other stimu li 
that are used to reduce their vulnerability or susceptibility to adverse impacts (Bradshaw et al., 2004). Adaptation deficit entails a 
situation in which a country experiences a lack of institutional, economic, and technological means to facilitate the adaptat ion 
process (Asfaw et al., 2018).

 impacting livelihoods and food security (UNOCHA, 2022) . A study on the effects of recent flooding 
in Nigeria shows that Adamawa state is among the most affected states with an estimated 
260,000 people exposed to floods and around a 1,000 km2 of land submer ged across the state 
(REACH Initiative , 2022) . This is attributed to heavy rainfalls (average of above 2000 mm and can 
reach 4000 mm in southern Nigeria) between the months of July and October 2022 (as compared 
to the overall annual average of 1000 mm) t hat caused an overflow of the Lagdo dam in 
neighboring Cameroon and increased flow of the Benue River. Besides climate variability, 
protracted and frequent violen t conflicts including the Boko Haram insurgenc e and herder -farmer  
conflicts  further disrupt ag ricultural activities and food supply chains that worsen food insecurity 
and malnutrition (Obi and Eboreime, 2017;  Baliki et al., 2018; Adelaja and George, 2019) . 
As climate shocks have become increasingly prevalent, governments and humanitarian 
organizations have stepped in to provide time -bound support to those worst affected. This support 
can take the form of food aid, temporary shelter, or basic services, but in creasingly, support is 
provided in the form of one -off cash transfers (Dietrich and Schmerzeck, 2019; Ferraro and 
Simorangkir, 2020 ; Pople et al., 2021 ). However, most humanitarian aid s largely focus on 
responding to post -shock crises (Nobre et al., 2019; Pichon, 2019; Levine et al., 2020) . This has 
raised a need for early/anticipatory actions to improve household preparedness and limit the 
devastating long -term impacts of climate shocks. If targeted properly, anticipatory actions can 
potentially help hou seholds to better prepare and respond to climate shocks, reduce vulnerability, 
and increase household resilience to shock (de Perez et al. 2015, Gros et al. 2022) .  
Findings from few existing studies indicate the positive impacts of anticipatory actions on 
various household level outcomes. Examples include a simulation -based study of anticipatory 
interventions on household level outcomes (Giuffrida et al., 2017); evaluation of the costs, benefits 
and returns on investment of ex -ante actions compared to ex -post responses (Gros et al., 2019; 
Nobre et al., 2019) ; and assessments of the impacts of anticipatory cash transfers on household 
welfare (Gros et al., 2019; Tanner et al., 2019; Hill et al., 2019; People et al., 2021). However, 
most of the existing st udies on the benefits  or impacts of anticipatory actions are based on either 
observational or quasi -experimental data (Levine et al., 2020; Pople et al., 2021) . There is limited 
randomized experimental evaluations of the impact of anticipatory cash trans fers in response to 
forecast based climatic shocks in the humanitarian sector (Puri et al., 2017; Levine et al., 2020; 
Pople et al., 2021) . We attribute this dearth of empirical evidence to various factors. First, it is 
difficult to justify the ethics of  a randomized control trial in life -or-death situations. Second, the 
need for speed with the lack of transparency in implementation obfuscates the identification of a 
valid counterfactual. Third, it is challenging to conduct a baseline when it is unknown a  priori 
where a disaster will strike, particularly since disasters ex -post disrupt the supply of basic services 
and infrastructure, including those needed for data collection. As a result, little is known on the 
impacts of cash transfers beyond the immedia te consumption support they provide, and how their 
impact is affected by their timing and targeting (Pople et al., 2021) .  
We study the differential impacts of anticipatory vs. post -shock one -off lump sum cash 
transfers for a fast onset climate shock (fl ooding) by randomly assigning the eligible population in 
anticipatory and post -shock cash transfer treatment groups. Thus, recipients of post -shock cash 
transfers are considered as ‘controls’ against the anticipatory cash recipients ‘treatment’ group. 
Our present study thus has several distinguishing features compared to past studies: (1) Data

 has come from a randomized experiment against observational or quasi -experimental studies 
such as that of Pople et al. (2021) where the identification strategy was ba sed on exogenous 
variations in administrative constraints. (2) We collected data through in -person surveys 
compared to phone interviews. In -person surveys improve data quality and enable the collection 
of more detailed information than phone interviews. (3 ) Unlike past studies that considered only 
a few welfare indicators (Gros et al, 2019) or the cost -effectiveness of ex -ante actions (Nobre et 
al., 2019), our study included several measures of welfare including the short -term food 
consumption score (FCS), reduced coping strategy index (rCSI), livelihood coping strategy index 
(LCSI), and wellbeing indicators. (4) With the exception of Pople et al. (2021) , many studies had 
imbalanced counterfactuals and used relatively small sample sizes. Our study is based  on a 
balanced counterfactual and a relatively large sample size of 1450 study households.  
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the welfare and other household level impacts 
of this anticipatory cash transfers against the conventional post -shock approach of cash transfers. 
Based on the balance test, our samples are well balanced across the pre - and post -shock groups, 
showing that the two groups are comparable across major socio -demographic variables 
measured at the baseline. Thus, our research design enables us to generate valid counterfactuals 
to assess anticipatory cash transfer as against post -shock cash. To the best of our knowledge, 
the present cash transfer intervention design is the first of its kind in cash transfer experimental 
design i mplemented in a conflict -prone environment that combined an anticipatory action with a 
conventional post -shock humanitarian response.

2. THE ‘CASH FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE’ INTERVENTION  
The International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) global mission is to help people whose lives and 
livelihoods are shattered by conflict and disaster, including the climate crisis, to sur vive, recover 
and gain control of their future. The IRC and Google.org have formed a partnership in Nigeria to 
catalyze a transformation in humanitarian preparedness and response to complex climate crises, 
investing in foundational innovations to create ne w products and services, as well as research to 
understand what works. This partnership is expected to advance innovations in responding to 
climate change induced risks for conflict - and crisis -affected people by integrating predictive 
analytics with cash assistance that will result in improved coping strategies, increased capacity 
for decision making, and more diversified  and profitable livelihoods. The goals of the intervention 
project include:  
1. Intervention : To reduce the use of negative coping strategies and support households to 
build resilience against climate shocks by providing climate risk reduction payments and early 
warning messaging to smallholder farmers.    
Page 9:

 2. Research : To assess the effectiveness of use of early warning systems and impacts of antic-
ipatory cash transfers versus post -shock cash transfers to mitigate the level of shock and 
stress experienced by smallholde r farmers in the event of a hazardous climatic event . 
3. Expected o utcome : Households reduce the use of negative coping strategies, improve food 
security and income, and build resilience to climatic shocks.  
The IRC’s central hypothesis is that when climate vu lnerable communities have timely access 
to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid 
negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. Community 
members are acute ly aware of how their environment is changing due to climate change, and 
these communities are rich with knowledge on climate change adaptation and mitigation 
measures. However, resource constrained communities lack effective systems to disseminate 
real-time information about climate risks and their potential severity and many households in 
resource constrained environments do not possess the financial means to implement adaptive or 
mitigation measures that would allow them to protect or adapt their livelih oods during a stress 
and/or shock. This is especially true in conflict -affected communities, where a lack of social 
cohesion and inter -community economic linkages can exacerbate vulnerabilities.  
To test this hypothesis, the IRC piloted the climate risk red uction payments in Adamawa state 
in northeast Nigeria with smallholder farmers and livestock owners. The project adopted a 
systems approach, working within and with the existing ICT systems (radio, SMS, voice, mobile, 
etc.), agriculture extension providers , and other key stakeholders within the government and 
community. The pilot project transferred a lump sum of anticipatory cash payments to a sample 
of 725 flood -prone households when triggered by the climate data platform risk thresholds. As 
controls to t his anticipatory cash transfer, an equal number of comparable households (‘control 
group’) received equal amount of cash payments post flooding shock. All households received 
early warning messages prior to the floods through community -based early warning workers. The 
pilot intervention/study focused on flooding because it is a predictable climatic shock with 
available well -established prediction data compared to other climate shocks.  
3. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
3.1 The s tudy area 
The project was implemented in Fufore Local Government Area (LGA) of Adamawa state, 
northeast Nigeria  situated between latitude 90 131 North and longitude 120 391 East (Figure 1) . 
Fufore  has a total land area of about 5,169 km2 with an estimated population of 2 07,286 
inhabitants  (National Bureau of Statistics,  2010). The area experiences distinct dry and wet 
seasons with temperature and humidity varying with season. The wet season is between April 
and October with an average annual rainfall of 750 to 1000mm. The  dry season period is between 
December and March and characterized by dry, dusty, and hazy northeast trade winds that blow 
over the area from Sahara Desert. Temperatures are relatively high almost all the year round, 
reaching about 420C during the dry seas on. The area is drained by a series of rivers and streams 
such as River Benue which takes its source from Cameroon, River Faro, and Ine., which all 
Page 10:

 encourage arable cropping, livestock rearing, and fishing. The major crops cultivated include 
millet, rice, beans, soyabean, and sorghum.     
Based on flooding severity, six communities situated close to the River Benue floodplain, Faro 
River and the Ladgo dam in Cameroon were targeted. These communities include Dulobwatiye, 
Ribado, Dasin_Hausa, Farangfarang, Ric o and Gembiusi. Most rural households  in Fofure LGA 
depend on the floodplain along the Upper River Benue for their agricultural production due to 
water availability during the off -season.  Although the floodplains are suitable for cultivation in the 
off-season, these farmers are exposed to flooding risk in the main rain y season and vulnerable to 
the impact of climate change. IRC’s assessment had identified r ecurrent flooding as a major 
hazard due to its impact on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

 3.2 Readiness and activation triggers for cash payments  
The IRC collaborated with the Nigeria Hydrological Service Agency (NiHSA), the Nigeria 
Meteorological Agency (NiMET) and the Upper Benue Basin D evelopment Authority (UBBDA) to 
set forecast -based thresholds and provide evidence on hydrological  and meteorological 
parameters for triggering anticipatory cash payments. The collaboration focused on real -time 
monitoring of water level, discharge, and rai nfall, data sharing, and early warning information 
dissemination to inform anticipatory action. These parameters were selected and monitored from 
existing gauge stations close to the communities of intervention. The analytics, data, thresholds 
set for these parameters and detailed descriptions of setting the thresholds are provided in Annex 
1.

The intervention also includes early warning messages by ten trained and experienced 
community early warning volunteers selected from the National Emergency Management Agency 
(NEMA), the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Fufore LGA, and community 
leaders (see Annex 2 for the contents of early warning messages). The volunteers were trained 
in the warning systems of disaster risk r eduction messaging, early action, and climate smart 
adaptation. This included information on planting early, use of drought resilient crops varieties, 
and early harvesting.  
3.3 Anticipatory and post -shock cash payments   
On 27 July 2022, the IRC provided a pre -shock cash transfer of N195,000 (~400 USD) to 725 
households (‘treatment group’) across the six communities in anticipation of the impending 
flooding. At the time of the cash distribution, the flash flooding water had cut -off three of the six

route. These communities were no longer accessible by vehicle or motor bike, leaving wooden 
boat as the alternative means of transport. Figure 4 presents the schematic pro cesses through 
which forecast -based anticipatory cash distribution decisions were made and implemented. An 
equal number of households i.e., 725 randomly assigned households (‘control group’) received 
same cash payments on 7 November 2022 after the flood re ceded and access was manageable.

3.4 Sampling frame and sample selection   
To construct a sampling frame from which to select participants for the intervention, the IRC 
conducted a blanket registration of all households in the six communities identified as the most 
historically affected by floods and climatic shocks in Fufore LGA . The registration process resulted 
in 2,095 households eligible for selection. Once the sampling frame was constructed, 1 ,450 
participants were selected using stratified random sampling with proportional allocation by 
community and gender. The sample func tion in R statistical software was used to randomly select 
household IDs with equal probability from the pool of eligible men and women within each 
community (Table 1).

3.5 Data Collection  
Baseline data were collected from the sample of 1450 experimental households before the 
intervention. Interviews were conducted by ten enumerators conversant with both the English and 
local Hausa language. Enumerators were provided rigorous fac e-to-face training on the study 
design, survey protocol, and research ethics. The endline survey was conducted with the same 
households five months after the implementation of the baseline survey. The questionnaires for 
both baseline and endline surveys we re pre -tested in a suburb of Yola town that were not part of 
the study communities. Surveys were conducted in -person and at the end of each survey day, 
enumerators uploaded the data to the server and senior researchers undertook quality checks. 
Debriefs we re held either at the end of the day or the start of the following day.  
Baseline data collection took place over a 17 -day period between 25 April and 31 May 2022. 
Since Ramadan had ended close to when baseline data collection was due to start, the survey 
was first administered in the majority of Christian communities and to re duce response bias a 
seven -day recall period was used for food security related questions. Some cross -checking 
questions were added to capture whether the household had recently been fasting. Similar field 
planning and survey administration procedures were  pursued for the endline data collection 
administered in December 2022, five months after the baseline survey. A larger pool of 
enumerators (twenty) was used for endline survey to complete data collection before the 2022 
Christmas holiday.

This pilot intervention was supported by Google.org and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the intervention is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. The project transferred a lump sum of cash to a treatment group of randomly sampled households when triggered by the climate data risk thresholds. An equal number of comparable households in a control group received the same amount of cash post flooding shock. The main purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of anticipatory cash against the traditional humanitarian post-shocks supporting mechanism. We collected baseline and endline data from a sample of 1450 experimental households (725 ‘treatment’ and 725 ‘control’) and analyzed the data using econometric models. Several outcome indicators including food security, climate adaptive and resilience actions, and wellbeing measures were used to assess the intervention. The results indicate that anticipatory cash has significant impacts on reducing negative coping strategies, increasing the number of pre-emptive climate adaptive actions, and increasing investment in productive assets that could enhance future resilience. On other hand, anticipatory cash transfers do not seem to have significant impacts on short-term food and non-food consumption expenditures compared to post-shock cash transfers. Our findings indicate that one-time large sum anticipatory transfer could lead households to build their climate resilience capacity, and hence a promising intervention to reduce the vulnerability of households to future climate shocks. Based on the findings we have two key recommendations: (1) Given the generally positive findings on household’s welfare and climate resilience capacity, we suggest humanitarian agencies and governments to consider anticipatory interventions (such as pre-shock cash transfers) as a mechanism for both meeting basic needs and improving climate resilience of households provided that quality data and analytics exist to predict a high probability of climate shocks. (2) As climate shocks continue to worsen and humanitarian funding needs remain unmet for both emergencies and early recovery, anticipatory approach may be critical to meeting the short- and long-term needs of climate and conflict-affected households.

 ABSTRACT  
This paper presents the findings from an experimental study designed to assess the impacts of one -time 
large lump sum cash transfers on welfare and coping strategies of smallholders in climate -risk and

and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the

 1. INTRODUCTION  
The rising frequency and intensity of climate variability and extreme weather events including 
unpredictable rainfall and temperature, flooding, and drought threaten food production, 
livelihoods, and food security of f arm households in sub -Saharan Africa (Di Falco et al., 2011; Di 
Falco and Veronesi, 2013; Hasegawa et al., 2015; Chonabayashi et al., 2020; Kuang et al., 2020; 
Tesfaye and Tirivayi, 2020). According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 
(2021) , frequent and intense floods, droughts and storms account for up to 90 percent of natural 
hazards worldwide. The climate crisis is intersecting with and compounding other drivers of 
severe food crisis , including conflict and economic downturns. Climate ch ange has become the 
primary factor affecting agricultural productivity and is deeply intertwined with food crises in the 
world (Nyathi et al., 2022) . The negative impacts of climate variability and change are felt more in 
developing countries like Nigeri a than the developed world due to limited coping strategies 
available to poorer populations (Adekola and Lamond 2018; Akinloye 2018) and ‘adaptation 
deficits’1to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 2014; Asfaw et 
al., 2018) . Poorer households with fewer livelihood assets, limited coping strategies, and 
dependent on climate sensitive economic activities such as subsistence farming are highly 
vulnerable to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 201 4; Gitz et 
al., 2016; Asfaw et al., 2018; Clarke et al., 2022).  
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to climate -related shocks and ranks high among the countries that 
are susceptible to climate change (Ebele and Emodi, 2016; Elias and Omojola, 2015).  Many 
state s in the country increasingly suffer perennial flooding (Echendu, 2020; 2021) , especially 
during the rainy season which occurs between March and November annually. In 2012, Nigeria 
experienced one of its largest floods in a century, causing the displacem ent of over 2.3 million 
people, 363 deaths, and impacted the livelihoods of over 16 million people (Adekola and Lamond, 
2018; Adelekan and Asiyanbi, 2016; Boamah et al., 2015) . Total economic losses were estimated 
at US$16.9 billion (Tiwari and Tiwari, 2 015). Several studies show that annual flooding has led to 
more displacements than any other climate disaster in Nigeria (Boamah et al., 2015; Echendu, 
2021; Tiwari and Tiwari, 2015; United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(UNOCHA), 2022a) . 
The situation is particularly severe in northeast states of Nigeria that have experienced 
decades of climatic shocks, insecurity , and consequent humanitarian crises (Madu, 2016; Federal 
Ministry of Environment, 2014; Hassan et al., 2019; K amta et al., 2020) . In recent years,  the 
frequency of flooding in the northeastern states Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe has shown significant 
increases. In 2019, these states faced the worst floods in seven years, which affected over 
300,000 people and had ca sualties five times more than those reported in previous years 
(UNOCHA, 2020). More recently, the flooding incidence that followed the 2022 rainy season led 
to loss of life, injuries, and damage to infrastructure, property, and agricultural land thereby 
 
1 Adaptation is generally described as those responses by individuals, groups and governments to climatic change or other stimu li 
that are used to reduce their vulnerability or susceptibility to adverse impacts (Bradshaw et al., 2004). Adaptation deficit entails a 
situation in which a country experiences a lack of institutional, economic, and technological means to facilitate the adaptat ion 
process (Asfaw et al., 2018).

 impacting livelihoods and food security (UNOCHA, 2022) . A study on the effects of recent flooding 
in Nigeria shows that Adamawa state is among the most affected states with an estimated 
260,000 people exposed to floods and around a 1,000 km2 of land submer ged across the state 
(REACH Initiative , 2022) . This is attributed to heavy rainfalls (average of above 2000 mm and can 
reach 4000 mm in southern Nigeria) between the months of July and October 2022 (as compared 
to the overall annual average of 1000 mm) t hat caused an overflow of the Lagdo dam in 
neighboring Cameroon and increased flow of the Benue River. Besides climate variability, 
protracted and frequent violen t conflicts including the Boko Haram insurgenc e and herder -farmer  
conflicts  further disrupt ag ricultural activities and food supply chains that worsen food insecurity 
and malnutrition (Obi and Eboreime, 2017;  Baliki et al., 2018; Adelaja and George, 2019) . 
As climate shocks have become increasingly prevalent, governments and humanitarian 
organizations have stepped in to provide time -bound support to those worst affected. This support 
can take the form of food aid, temporary shelter, or basic services, but in creasingly, support is 
provided in the form of one -off cash transfers (Dietrich and Schmerzeck, 2019; Ferraro and 
Simorangkir, 2020 ; Pople et al., 2021 ). However, most humanitarian aid s largely focus on 
responding to post -shock crises (Nobre et al., 2019; Pichon, 2019; Levine et al., 2020) . This has 
raised a need for early/anticipatory actions to improve household preparedness and limit the 
devastating long -term impacts of climate shocks. If targeted properly, anticipatory actions can 
potentially help hou seholds to better prepare and respond to climate shocks, reduce vulnerability, 
and increase household resilience to shock (de Perez et al. 2015, Gros et al. 2022) .  
Findings from few existing studies indicate the positive impacts of anticipatory actions on 
various household level outcomes. Examples include a simulation -based study of anticipatory 
interventions on household level outcomes (Giuffrida et al., 2017); evaluation of the costs, benefits 
and returns on investment of ex -ante actions compared to ex -post responses (Gros et al., 2019; 
Nobre et al., 2019) ; and assessments of the impacts of anticipatory cash transfers on household 
welfare (Gros et al., 2019; Tanner et al., 2019; Hill et al., 2019; People et al., 2021). However, 
most of the existing st udies on the benefits  or impacts of anticipatory actions are based on either 
observational or quasi -experimental data (Levine et al., 2020; Pople et al., 2021) . There is limited 
randomized experimental evaluations of the impact of anticipatory cash trans fers in response to 
forecast based climatic shocks in the humanitarian sector (Puri et al., 2017; Levine et al., 2020; 
Pople et al., 2021) . We attribute this dearth of empirical evidence to various factors. First, it is 
difficult to justify the ethics of  a randomized control trial in life -or-death situations. Second, the 
need for speed with the lack of transparency in implementation obfuscates the identification of a 
valid counterfactual. Third, it is challenging to conduct a baseline when it is unknown a  priori 
where a disaster will strike, particularly since disasters ex -post disrupt the supply of basic services 
and infrastructure, including those needed for data collection. As a result, little is known on the 
impacts of cash transfers beyond the immedia te consumption support they provide, and how their 
impact is affected by their timing and targeting (Pople et al., 2021) .  
We study the differential impacts of anticipatory vs. post -shock one -off lump sum cash 
transfers for a fast onset climate shock (fl ooding) by randomly assigning the eligible population in 
anticipatory and post -shock cash transfer treatment groups. Thus, recipients of post -shock cash 
transfers are considered as ‘controls’ against the anticipatory cash recipients ‘treatment’ group. 
Our present study thus has several distinguishing features compared to past studies: (1) Data

 has come from a randomized experiment against observational or quasi -experimental studies 
such as that of Pople et al. (2021) where the identification strategy was ba sed on exogenous 
variations in administrative constraints. (2) We collected data through in -person surveys 
compared to phone interviews. In -person surveys improve data quality and enable the collection 
of more detailed information than phone interviews. (3 ) Unlike past studies that considered only 
a few welfare indicators (Gros et al, 2019) or the cost -effectiveness of ex -ante actions (Nobre et 
al., 2019), our study included several measures of welfare including the short -term food 
consumption score (FCS), reduced coping strategy index (rCSI), livelihood coping strategy index 
(LCSI), and wellbeing indicators. (4) With the exception of Pople et al. (2021) , many studies had 
imbalanced counterfactuals and used relatively small sample sizes. Our study is based  on a 
balanced counterfactual and a relatively large sample size of 1450 study households.  
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the welfare and other household level impacts 
of this anticipatory cash transfers against the conventional post -shock approach of cash transfers. 
Based on the balance test, our samples are well balanced across the pre - and post -shock groups, 
showing that the two groups are comparable across major socio -demographic variables 
measured at the baseline. Thus, our research design enables us to generate valid counterfactuals 
to assess anticipatory cash transfer as against post -shock cash. To the best of our knowledge, 
the present cash transfer intervention design is the first of its kind in cash transfer experimental 
design i mplemented in a conflict -prone environment that combined an anticipatory action with a 
conventional post -shock humanitarian response.  
The remaining parts of the paper  are organized as follows. Section 2 provides the description 
of ‘cash for climate resili ence’ intervention. The study methods including research design, data 
collection and econometric strategies are presented in section 3.  Sections 4 and 5 respectively 
present descriptive and econometric results. The last section concludes the paper with so me 
policy recommendations.  
2. THE ‘CASH FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE’ INTERVENTION  
The International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) global mission is to help people whose lives and 
livelihoods are shattered by conflict and disaster, including the climate crisis, to sur vive, recover 
and gain control of their future. The IRC and Google.org have formed a partnership in Nigeria to 
catalyze a transformation in humanitarian preparedness and response to complex climate crises, 
investing in foundational innovations to create ne w products and services, as well as research to 
understand what works. This partnership is expected to advance innovations in responding to 
climate change induced risks for conflict - and crisis -affected people by integrating predictive 
analytics with cash assistance that will result in improved coping strategies, increased capacity 
for decision making, and more diversified  and profitable livelihoods. The goals of the intervention 
project include:  
1. Intervention : To reduce the use of negative coping strategies and support households to 
build resilience against climate shocks by providing climate risk reduction payments and early 
warning messaging to smallholder farmers.    
Page 9:

 2. Research : To assess the effectiveness of use of early warning systems and impacts of antic-
ipatory cash transfers versus post -shock cash transfers to mitigate the level of shock and 
stress experienced by smallholde r farmers in the event of a hazardous climatic event . 
3. Expected o utcome : Households reduce the use of negative coping strategies, improve food 
security and income, and build resilience to climatic shocks.  
The IRC’s central hypothesis is that when climate vu lnerable communities have timely access 
to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid 
negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. Community 
members are acute ly aware of how their environment is changing due to climate change, and 
these communities are rich with knowledge on climate change adaptation and mitigation 
measures. However, resource constrained communities lack effective systems to disseminate 
real-time information about climate risks and their potential severity and many households in 
resource constrained environments do not possess the financial means to implement adaptive or 
mitigation measures that would allow them to protect or adapt their livelih oods during a stress 
and/or shock. This is especially true in conflict -affected communities, where a lack of social 
cohesion and inter -community economic linkages can exacerbate vulnerabilities.  
To test this hypothesis, the IRC piloted the climate risk red uction payments in Adamawa state 
in northeast Nigeria with smallholder farmers and livestock owners. The project adopted a 
systems approach, working within and with the existing ICT systems (radio, SMS, voice, mobile, 
etc.), agriculture extension providers , and other key stakeholders within the government and 
community. The pilot project transferred a lump sum of anticipatory cash payments to a sample 
of 725 flood -prone households when triggered by the climate data platform risk thresholds. As 
controls to t his anticipatory cash transfer, an equal number of comparable households (‘control 
group’) received equal amount of cash payments post flooding shock. All households received 
early warning messages prior to the floods through community -based early warning workers. The 
pilot intervention/study focused on flooding because it is a predictable climatic shock with 
available well -established prediction data compared to other climate shocks.  
3. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
3.1 The s tudy area 
The project was implemented in Fufore Local Government Area (LGA) of Adamawa state, 
northeast Nigeria  situated between latitude 90 131 North and longitude 120 391 East (Figure 1) . 
Fufore  has a total land area of about 5,169 km2 with an estimated population of 2 07,286 
inhabitants  (National Bureau of Statistics,  2010). The area experiences distinct dry and wet 
seasons with temperature and humidity varying with season. The wet season is between April 
and October with an average annual rainfall of 750 to 1000mm. The  dry season period is between 
December and March and characterized by dry, dusty, and hazy northeast trade winds that blow 
over the area from Sahara Desert. Temperatures are relatively high almost all the year round, 
reaching about 420C during the dry seas on. The area is drained by a series of rivers and streams 
such as River Benue which takes its source from Cameroon, River Faro, and Ine., which all 
Page 10:

 encourage arable cropping, livestock rearing, and fishing. The major crops cultivated include 
millet, rice, beans, soyabean, and sorghum.     
Based on flooding severity, six communities situated close to the River Benue floodplain, Faro 
River and the Ladgo dam in Cameroon were targeted. These communities include Dulobwatiye, 
Ribado, Dasin_Hausa, Farangfarang, Ric o and Gembiusi. Most rural households  in Fofure LGA 
depend on the floodplain along the Upper River Benue for their agricultural production due to 
water availability during the off -season.  Although the floodplains are suitable for cultivation in the 
off-season, these farmers are exposed to flooding risk in the main rain y season and vulnerable to 
the impact of climate change. IRC’s assessment had identified r ecurrent flooding as a major 
hazard due to its impact on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

 3.2 Readiness and activation triggers for cash payments  
The IRC collaborated with the Nigeria Hydrological Service Agency (NiHSA), the Nigeria 
Meteorological Agency (NiMET) and the Upper Benue Basin D evelopment Authority (UBBDA) to 
set forecast -based thresholds and provide evidence on hydrological  and meteorological 
parameters for triggering anticipatory cash payments. The collaboration focused on real -time 
monitoring of water level, discharge, and rai nfall, data sharing, and early warning information 
dissemination to inform anticipatory action. These parameters were selected and monitored from 
existing gauge stations close to the communities of intervention. The analytics, data, thresholds 
set for these parameters and detailed descriptions of setting the thresholds are provided in Annex 
1.

The intervention also includes early warning messages by ten trained and experienced 
community early warning volunteers selected from the National Emergency Management Agency 
(NEMA), the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Fufore LGA, and community 
leaders (see Annex 2 for the contents of early warning messages). The volunteers were trained 
in the warning systems of disaster risk r eduction messaging, early action, and climate smart 
adaptation. This included information on planting early, use of drought resilient crops varieties, 
and early harvesting.  
3.3 Anticipatory and post -shock cash payments   
On 27 July 2022, the IRC provided a pre -shock cash transfer of N195,000 (~400 USD) to 725 
households (‘treatment group’) across the six communities in anticipation of the impending 
flooding. At the time of the cash distribution, the flash flooding water had cut -off three of the six

 study c ommunities (Dulobatiye, Farang -Farang and Rico) from accessing to the main transport 
route. These communities were no longer accessible by vehicle or motor bike, leaving wooden 
boat as the alternative means of transport. Figure 4 presents the schematic pro cesses through 
which forecast -based anticipatory cash distribution decisions were made and implemented. An 
equal number of households i.e., 725 randomly assigned households (‘control group’) received 
same cash payments on 7 November 2022 after the flood re ceded and access was manageable.

3.4 Sampling frame and sample selection   
To construct a sampling frame from which to select participants for the intervention, the IRC 
conducted a blanket registration of all households in the six communities identified as the most 
historically affected by floods and climatic shocks in Fufore LGA . The registration process resulted 
in 2,095 households eligible for selection. Once the sampling frame was constructed, 1 ,450 
participants were selected using stratified random sampling with proportional allocation by 
community and gender. The sample func tion in R statistical software was used to randomly select 
household IDs with equal probability from the pool of eligible men and women within each 
community (Table 1).

3.5 Data Collection  
Baseline data were collected from the sample of 1450 experimental households before the 
intervention. Interviews were conducted by ten enumerators conversant with both the English and 
local Hausa language. Enumerators were provided rigorous fac e-to-face training on the study 
design, survey protocol, and research ethics. The endline survey was conducted with the same 
households five months after the implementation of the baseline survey. The questionnaires for 
both baseline and endline surveys we re pre -tested in a suburb of Yola town that were not part of 
the study communities. Surveys were conducted in -person and at the end of each survey day, 
enumerators uploaded the data to the server and senior researchers undertook quality checks. 
Debriefs we re held either at the end of the day or the start of the following day.  
Baseline data collection took place over a 17 -day period between 25 April and 31 May 2022. 
Since Ramadan had ended close to when baseline data collection was due to start, the survey 
was first administered in the majority of Christian communities and to re duce response bias a 
seven -day recall period was used for food security related questions. Some cross -checking 
questions were added to capture whether the household had recently been fasting. Similar field 
planning and survey administration procedures were  pursued for the endline data collection 
administered in December 2022, five months after the baseline survey. A larger pool of 
enumerators (twenty) was used for endline survey to complete data collection before the 2022 
Christmas holiday.

This pilot intervention was supported by Google.org and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the intervention is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. The project transferred a lump sum of cash to a treatment group of randomly sampled households when triggered by the climate data risk thresholds. An equal number of comparable households in a control group received the same amount of cash post flooding shock. The main purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of anticipatory cash against the traditional humanitarian post-shocks supporting mechanism. We collected baseline and endline data from a sample of 1450 experimental households (725 ‘treatment’ and 725 ‘control’) and analyzed the data using econometric models. Several outcome indicators including food security, climate adaptive and resilience actions, and wellbeing measures were used to assess the intervention. The results indicate that anticipatory cash has significant impacts on reducing negative coping strategies, increasing the number of pre-emptive climate adaptive actions, and increasing investment in productive assets that could enhance future resilience. On other hand, anticipatory cash transfers do not seem to have significant impacts on short-term food and non-food consumption expenditures compared to post-shock cash transfers. Our findings indicate that one-time large sum anticipatory transfer could lead households to build their climate resilience capacity, and hence a promising intervention to reduce the vulnerability of households to future climate shocks. Based on the findings we have two key recommendations: (1) Given the generally positive findings on household’s welfare and climate resilience capacity, we suggest humanitarian agencies and governments to consider anticipatory interventions (such as pre-shock cash transfers) as a mechanism for both meeting basic needs and improving climate resilience of households provided that quality data and analytics exist to predict a high probability of climate shocks. (2) As climate shocks continue to worsen and humanitarian funding needs remain unmet for both emergencies and early recovery, anticipatory approach may be critical to meeting the short- and long-term needs of climate and conflict-affected households.

 ABSTRACT  
This paper presents the findings from an experimental study designed to assess the impacts of one -time 
large lump sum cash transfers on welfare and coping strategies of smallholders in climate -risk and 
conflict -affected communities in northeast Nigeria. Th is pilot intervention was supported by Google.org 
and implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The central hypothesis of the 
intervention is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the 
financial and so cial resources to act upon that information, they will avoid negative coping strategies and 
build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. The project transferred a lump sum of cash to a 
treatment group of randomly sampled households when trigge red by the climate data risk thresholds. An 
equal number of comparable households in a control group received the same amount of cash post -
flooding shock. The main purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of anticipatory cash against 
the traditional humanitarian post -shocks supporting mechanism. We collected  baseline and endline data 
from a sample of 1450 experimental households (725 ‘treatment’ and 725 ‘control’) and analyzed  the 
data using econometric model s. Several outcome indicators including foo d security, climate adaptive and 
resilience actions, and wellbeing measures were used to assess the intervention. The results indicate 
that anticipatory cash has significant impacts on reducing negative coping strategies, increasing the 
number of pre -empti ve climate adaptive actions, and increasing investment in productive assets that 
could enhance future resilience. On other hand, anticipatory cash transfers do not seem to have 
significant impacts on short -term food and non -food consumption expenditures co mpared to post -shock 
cash transfers. Our findings indicate that one -time large sum anticipatory transfer could lead households 
to build their climate resilience capacity, and hence a promising intervention to reduce the vulnerability 
of households to futur e climate shocks. Based on the findings we have  two key recommendations: (1) 
Given the generally positive findings on household’s welfare and climate resilience capacity, we suggest 
humanitarian agencies and governments to consider anticipatory interventio ns (such as pre -shock cash 
transfers) as a mechanism for both meeting basic needs and  improving climate resilience of households  
provided that quality data and analytics exist to predict  a high probability of climate shocks . (2) As climate 
shocks continue to worsen and humanitarian funding needs remain unmet  for both emerge ncies and 
early recovery , anticipatory approach may be critical to meeting the short - and long -term needs of climate - 
and conflict -affected households.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
The rising frequency and intensity of climate variability and extreme weather events including 
unpredictable rainfall and temperature, flooding, and drought threaten food production, 
livelihoods, and food security of f arm households in sub -Saharan Africa (Di Falco et al., 2011; Di 
Falco and Veronesi, 2013; Hasegawa et al., 2015; Chonabayashi et al., 2020; Kuang et al., 2020; 
Tesfaye and Tirivayi, 2020). According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 
(2021) , frequent and intense floods, droughts and storms account for up to 90 percent of natural 
hazards worldwide. The climate crisis is intersecting with and compounding other drivers of 
severe food crisis , including conflict and economic downturns. Climate ch ange has become the 
primary factor affecting agricultural productivity and is deeply intertwined with food crises in the 
world (Nyathi et al., 2022) . The negative impacts of climate variability and change are felt more in 
developing countries like Nigeri a than the developed world due to limited coping strategies 
available to poorer populations (Adekola and Lamond 2018; Akinloye 2018) and ‘adaptation 
deficits’1to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 2014; Asfaw et 
al., 2018) . Poorer households with fewer livelihood assets, limited coping strategies, and 
dependent on climate sensitive economic activities such as subsistence farming are highly 
vulnerable to climatic shocks (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Fankhauser and McDermott, 201 4; Gitz et 
al., 2016; Asfaw et al., 2018; Clarke et al., 2022).  
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to climate -related shocks and ranks high among the countries that 
are susceptible to climate change (Ebele and Emodi, 2016; Elias and Omojola, 2015).  Many 
state s in the country increasingly suffer perennial flooding (Echendu, 2020; 2021) , especially 
during the rainy season which occurs between March and November annually. In 2012, Nigeria 
experienced one of its largest floods in a century, causing the displacem ent of over 2.3 million 
people, 363 deaths, and impacted the livelihoods of over 16 million people (Adekola and Lamond, 
2018; Adelekan and Asiyanbi, 2016; Boamah et al., 2015) . Total economic losses were estimated 
at US$16.9 billion (Tiwari and Tiwari, 2 015). Several studies show that annual flooding has led to 
more displacements than any other climate disaster in Nigeria (Boamah et al., 2015; Echendu, 
2021; Tiwari and Tiwari, 2015; United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(UNOCHA), 2022a) . 
The situation is particularly severe in northeast states of Nigeria that have experienced 
decades of climatic shocks, insecurity , and consequent humanitarian crises (Madu, 2016; Federal 
Ministry of Environment, 2014; Hassan et al., 2019; K amta et al., 2020) . In recent years,  the 
frequency of flooding in the northeastern states Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe has shown significant 
increases. In 2019, these states faced the worst floods in seven years, which affected over 
300,000 people and had ca sualties five times more than those reported in previous years 
(UNOCHA, 2020). More recently, the flooding incidence that followed the 2022 rainy season led 
to loss of life, injuries, and damage to infrastructure, property, and agricultural land thereby 
 
1 Adaptation is generally described as those responses by individuals, groups and governments to climatic change or other stimu li 
that are used to reduce their vulnerability or susceptibility to adverse impacts (Bradshaw et al., 2004). Adaptation deficit entails a 
situation in which a country experiences a lack of institutional, economic, and technological means to facilitate the adaptat ion 
process (Asfaw et al., 2018).

 impacting livelihoods and food security (UNOCHA, 2022) . A study on the effects of recent flooding 
in Nigeria shows that Adamawa state is among the most affected states with an estimated 
260,000 people exposed to floods and around a 1,000 km2 of land submer ged across the state 
(REACH Initiative , 2022) . This is attributed to heavy rainfalls (average of above 2000 mm and can 
reach 4000 mm in southern Nigeria) between the months of July and October 2022 (as compared 
to the overall annual average of 1000 mm) t hat caused an overflow of the Lagdo dam in 
neighboring Cameroon and increased flow of the Benue River. Besides climate variability, 
protracted and frequent violen t conflicts including the Boko Haram insurgenc e and herder -farmer  
conflicts  further disrupt ag ricultural activities and food supply chains that worsen food insecurity 
and malnutrition (Obi and Eboreime, 2017;  Baliki et al., 2018; Adelaja and George, 2019) . 
As climate shocks have become increasingly prevalent, governments and humanitarian 
organizations have stepped in to provide time -bound support to those worst affected. This support 
can take the form of food aid, temporary shelter, or basic services, but in creasingly, support is 
provided in the form of one -off cash transfers (Dietrich and Schmerzeck, 2019; Ferraro and 
Simorangkir, 2020 ; Pople et al., 2021 ). However, most humanitarian aid s largely focus on 
responding to post -shock crises (Nobre et al., 2019; Pichon, 2019; Levine et al., 2020) . This has 
raised a need for early/anticipatory actions to improve household preparedness and limit the 
devastating long -term impacts of climate shocks. If targeted properly, anticipatory actions can 
potentially help hou seholds to better prepare and respond to climate shocks, reduce vulnerability, 
and increase household resilience to shock (de Perez et al. 2015, Gros et al. 2022) .  
Findings from few existing studies indicate the positive impacts of anticipatory actions on 
various household level outcomes. Examples include a simulation -based study of anticipatory 
interventions on household level outcomes (Giuffrida et al., 2017); evaluation of the costs, benefits 
and returns on investment of ex -ante actions compared to ex -post responses (Gros et al., 2019; 
Nobre et al., 2019) ; and assessments of the impacts of anticipatory cash transfers on household 
welfare (Gros et al., 2019; Tanner et al., 2019; Hill et al., 2019; People et al., 2021). However, 
most of the existing st udies on the benefits  or impacts of anticipatory actions are based on either 
observational or quasi -experimental data (Levine et al., 2020; Pople et al., 2021) . There is limited 
randomized experimental evaluations of the impact of anticipatory cash trans fers in response to 
forecast based climatic shocks in the humanitarian sector (Puri et al., 2017; Levine et al., 2020; 
Pople et al., 2021) . We attribute this dearth of empirical evidence to various factors. First, it is 
difficult to justify the ethics of  a randomized control trial in life -or-death situations. Second, the 
need for speed with the lack of transparency in implementation obfuscates the identification of a 
valid counterfactual. Third, it is challenging to conduct a baseline when it is unknown a  priori 
where a disaster will strike, particularly since disasters ex -post disrupt the supply of basic services 
and infrastructure, including those needed for data collection. As a result, little is known on the 
impacts of cash transfers beyond the immedia te consumption support they provide, and how their 
impact is affected by their timing and targeting (Pople et al., 2021) .  
We study the differential impacts of anticipatory vs. post -shock one -off lump sum cash 
transfers for a fast onset climate shock (fl ooding) by randomly assigning the eligible population in 
anticipatory and post -shock cash transfer treatment groups. Thus, recipients of post -shock cash 
transfers are considered as ‘controls’ against the anticipatory cash recipients ‘treatment’ group. 
Our present study thus has several distinguishing features compared to past studies: (1) Data

 has come from a randomized experiment against observational or quasi -experimental studies 
such as that of Pople et al. (2021) where the identification strategy was ba sed on exogenous 
variations in administrative constraints. (2) We collected data through in -person surveys 
compared to phone interviews. In -person surveys improve data quality and enable the collection 
of more detailed information than phone interviews. (3 ) Unlike past studies that considered only 
a few welfare indicators (Gros et al, 2019) or the cost -effectiveness of ex -ante actions (Nobre et 
al., 2019), our study included several measures of welfare including the short -term food 
consumption score (FCS), reduced coping strategy index (rCSI), livelihood coping strategy index 
(LCSI), and wellbeing indicators. (4) With the exception of Pople et al. (2021) , many studies had 
imbalanced counterfactuals and used relatively small sample sizes. Our study is based  on a 
balanced counterfactual and a relatively large sample size of 1450 study households.  
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the welfare and other household level impacts 
of this anticipatory cash transfers against the conventional post -shock approach of cash transfers. 
Based on the balance test, our samples are well balanced across the pre - and post -shock groups, 
showing that the two groups are comparable across major socio -demographic variables 
measured at the baseline. Thus, our research design enables us to generate valid counterfactuals 
to assess anticipatory cash transfer as against post -shock cash. To the best of our knowledge, 
the present cash transfer intervention design is the first of its kind in cash transfer experimental 
design i mplemented in a conflict -prone environment that combined an anticipatory action with a 
conventional post -shock humanitarian response.  
The remaining parts of the paper  are organized as follows. Section 2 provides the description 
of ‘cash for climate resili ence’ intervention. The study methods including research design, data 
collection and econometric strategies are presented in section 3.  Sections 4 and 5 respectively 
present descriptive and econometric results. The last section concludes the paper with so me 
policy recommendations.  
2. THE ‘CASH FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE’ INTERVENTION  
The International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) global mission is to help people whose lives and 
livelihoods are shattered by conflict and disaster, including the climate crisis, to sur vive, recover 
and gain control of their future. The IRC and Google.org have formed a partnership in Nigeria to 
catalyze a transformation in humanitarian preparedness and response to complex climate crises, 
investing in foundational innovations to create ne w products and services, as well as research to 
understand what works. This partnership is expected to advance innovations in responding to 
climate change induced risks for conflict - and crisis -affected people by integrating predictive 
analytics with cash assistance that will result in improved coping strategies, increased capacity 
for decision making, and more diversified  and profitable livelihoods. The goals of the intervention 
project include:  
1. Intervention : To reduce the use of negative coping strategies and support households to 
build resilience against climate shocks by providing climate risk reduction payments and early 
warning messaging to smallholder farmers.    
Page 9:

 2. Research : To assess the effectiveness of use of early warning systems and impacts of antic-
ipatory cash transfers versus post -shock cash transfers to mitigate the level of shock and 
stress experienced by smallholde r farmers in the event of a hazardous climatic event . 
3. Expected o utcome : Households reduce the use of negative coping strategies, improve food 
security and income, and build resilience to climatic shocks.  
The IRC’s central hypothesis is that when climate vu lnerable communities have timely access 
to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid 
negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods. Community 
members are acute ly aware of how their environment is changing due to climate change, and 
these communities are rich with knowledge on climate change adaptation and mitigation 
measures. However, resource constrained communities lack effective systems to disseminate 
real-time information about climate risks and their potential severity and many households in 
resource constrained environments do not possess the financial means to implement adaptive or 
mitigation measures that would allow them to protect or adapt their livelih oods during a stress 
and/or shock. This is especially true in conflict -affected communities, where a lack of social 
cohesion and inter -community economic linkages can exacerbate vulnerabilities.  
To test this hypothesis, the IRC piloted the climate risk red uction payments in Adamawa state 
in northeast Nigeria with smallholder farmers and livestock owners. The project adopted a 
systems approach, working within and with the existing ICT systems (radio, SMS, voice, mobile, 
etc.), agriculture extension providers , and other key stakeholders within the government and 
community. The pilot project transferred a lump sum of anticipatory cash payments to a sample 
of 725 flood -prone households when triggered by the climate data platform risk thresholds. As 
controls to t his anticipatory cash transfer, an equal number of comparable households (‘control 
group’) received equal amount of cash payments post flooding shock. All households received 
early warning messages prior to the floods through community -based early warning workers. The 
pilot intervention/study focused on flooding because it is a predictable climatic shock with 
available well -established prediction data compared to other climate shocks.  
3. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
3.1 The s tudy area 
The project was implemented in Fufore Local Government Area (LGA) of Adamawa state, 
northeast Nigeria  situated between latitude 90 131 North and longitude 120 391 East (Figure 1) . 
Fufore  has a total land area of about 5,169 km2 with an estimated population of 2 07,286 
inhabitants  (National Bureau of Statistics,  2010). The area experiences distinct dry and wet 
seasons with temperature and humidity varying with season. The wet season is between April 
and October with an average annual rainfall of 750 to 1000mm. The  dry season period is between 
December and March and characterized by dry, dusty, and hazy northeast trade winds that blow 
over the area from Sahara Desert. Temperatures are relatively high almost all the year round, 
reaching about 420C during the dry seas on. The area is drained by a series of rivers and streams 
such as River Benue which takes its source from Cameroon, River Faro, and Ine., which all 
Page 10:

 encourage arable cropping, livestock rearing, and fishing. The major crops cultivated include 
millet, rice, beans, soyabean, and sorghum.     
Based on flooding severity, six communities situated close to the River Benue floodplain, Faro 
River and the Ladgo dam in Cameroon were targeted. These communities include Dulobwatiye, 
Ribado, Dasin_Hausa, Farangfarang, Ric o and Gembiusi. Most rural households  in Fofure LGA 
depend on the floodplain along the Upper River Benue for their agricultural production due to 
water availability during the off -season.  Although the floodplains are suitable for cultivation in the 
off-season, these farmers are exposed to flooding risk in the main rain y season and vulnerable to 
the impact of climate change. IRC’s assessment had identified r ecurrent flooding as a major 
hazard due to its impact on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

 3.2 Readiness and activation triggers for cash payments  
The IRC collaborated with the Nigeria Hydrological Service Agency (NiHSA), the Nigeria 
Meteorological Agency (NiMET) and the Upper Benue Basin D evelopment Authority (UBBDA) to 
set forecast -based thresholds and provide evidence on hydrological  and meteorological 
parameters for triggering anticipatory cash payments. The collaboration focused on real -time 
monitoring of water level, discharge, and rai nfall, data sharing, and early warning information 
dissemination to inform anticipatory action. These parameters were selected and monitored from 
existing gauge stations close to the communities of intervention. The analytics, data, thresholds 
set for these parameters and detailed descriptions of setting the thresholds are provided in Annex 
1.

The intervention also includes early warning messages by ten trained and experienced 
community early warning volunteers selected from the National Emergency Management Agency 
(NEMA), the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Fufore LGA, and community 
leaders (see Annex 2 for the contents of early warning messages). The volunteers were trained 
in the warning systems of disaster risk r eduction messaging, early action, and climate smart 
adaptation. This included information on planting early, use of drought resilient crops varieties, 
and early harvesting.  
3.3 Anticipatory and post -shock cash payments   
On 27 July 2022, the IRC provided a pre -shock cash transfer of N195,000 (~400 USD) to 725 
households (‘treatment group’) across the six communities in anticipation of the impending 
flooding. At the time of the cash distribution, the flash flooding water had cut -off three of the six

 study c ommunities (Dulobatiye, Farang -Farang and Rico) from accessing to the main transport 
route. These communities were no longer accessible by vehicle or motor bike, leaving wooden 
boat as the alternative means of transport. Figure 4 presents the schematic pro cesses through 
which forecast -based anticipatory cash distribution decisions were made and implemented. An 
equal number of households i.e., 725 randomly assigned households (‘control group’) received 
same cash payments on 7 November 2022 after the flood re ceded and access was manageable.

3.4 Sampling frame and sample selection   
To construct a sampling frame from which to select participants for the intervention, the IRC 
conducted a blanket registration of all households in the six communities identified as the most 
historically affected by floods and climatic shocks in Fufore LGA . The registration process resulted 
in 2,095 households eligible for selection. Once the sampling frame was constructed, 1 ,450 
participants were selected using stratified random sampling with proportional allocation by 
community and gender. The sample func tion in R statistical software was used to randomly select 
household IDs with equal probability from the pool of eligible men and women within each 
community (Table 1).

3.5 Data Collection  
Baseline data were collected from the sample of 1450 experimental households before the 
intervention. Interviews were conducted by ten enumerators conversant with both the English and 
local Hausa language. Enumerators were provided rigorous fac e-to-face training on the study 
design, survey protocol, and research ethics. The endline survey was conducted with the same 
households five months after the implementation of the baseline survey. The questionnaires for 
both baseline and endline surveys we re pre -tested in a suburb of Yola town that were not part of 
the study communities. Surveys were conducted in -person and at the end of each survey day, 
enumerators uploaded the data to the server and senior researchers undertook quality checks. 
Debriefs we re held either at the end of the day or the start of the following day.  
Baseline data collection took place over a 17 -day period between 25 April and 31 May 2022. 
Since Ramadan had ended close to when baseline data collection was due to start, the survey 
was first administered in the majority of Christian communities and to re duce response bias a 
seven -day recall period was used for food security related questions. Some cross -checking 
questions were added to capture whether the household had recently been fasting. Similar field 
planning and survey administration procedures were  pursued for the endline data collection 
administered in December 2022, five months after the baseline survey. A larger pool of 
enumerators (twenty) was used for endline survey to complete data collection before the 2022 
Christmas holiday.

 Page 4 of 13   1. Background information  
Improving the productivity of sheep and goats in pastoral production systems offers an opportunity 
for enhancing household incomes and building resilience within communities in the face of climate 
change. Practical equitable schemes with robust and weather -aware plans for propagating improved 
animals can help communities adapt to changing climates while sustainably managing and improving 
the productivity of their flocks. However, there is limited information on pastoralists ’ knowledge of 
anticipated climati c changes, adaptation options, and behavioral change practices they would need 
to adequately cope for the survival and management of their livestock genetic diversity. The existing capacities of national, and sub -national institutions and knowledge support  systems also need to be 
enhanced to more equitably support the production and offtake of sheep and goats to enable better livelihoods for pastoral communities experiencing climatic shocks . 
As part of the CGIAR Livestock, Climate and System Resilience (LCSR) Initiative , the International 
Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in partnership with the Resource Conflict Institute (RECONCILE) 
are implementing interventions to promote practices that enable the adoption of climate- smart 
community -based innovations for efficient and sustainable sheep and goat production in pastoral 
systems of Bari ngo County. Interventions are f ocused  on: 
1. Adapting community -inclusive methodologies and technologies for improving sheep and 
goat productivity in pastoral systems .  
2. Developing the capacity of national actors in adapting community -inclusive climate -smart 
methodologies and technologies to improve sheep and goat productivity under pastoral 
systems.  
3. Documenting methodologies, innovations, and tools for community -inclusive climate -smart, 
sheep and goat production under pastoral systems . 
2. Capacity building for national actors  
To enable the scaling of practices and more sustainable use o f the technologies  and adapted 
methodologies for improving sheep and goat production in the pastoral systems , the project is using 
a Training of Trainers (ToT) approach targeting  national, county , and private sector actors engaged in 
livestock production interventions in Baringo C ounty.  Through the ToT, it is anticipated that a larger 
number of communities will benefit from new knowledge and practices for improving the 
productivity and marketing o f their livestock.  
The first ToT was held for 10 technical personnel from the Department of Agriculture, Livestock 
Development and Fisheries in  Baringo County  (Table 1) .

Training content  
The ToT program introduced the planned community -based innovations and practices for climate -
smart sheep and goat production under pastoral production systems through interactive learning 
sessions covering the following topics:  
• An impact pathway for best practices for selective breeding of improved sheep and goats 
in pastoral systems.  
• Developing a county profile around sheep and goat enterprises in pastoral communities  
• Engaging and integrating communities in planned interventions around their livestock resources  
• Collection and monitoring of livestock data in pastoral systems using digital tools.

3. Institutions and i nfrastructure that support sheep and goat 
production in Baringo County  
The facilitation team’s unpacking of the impact pathway sparked significant interest among the 
training participants, leading them to outline the existing infrastructure and institutions supporting 
sheep and goat production in the county and to identify cr itical areas that required change. The 
information generated through this activity is presented in Table 2.

Infrastructure/ institution  Key function or role  Opportunities for change  
Sheep and Goat Multiplication 
Center  
i. Kimose  Sheep and Goat 
Station  Promote growth of the 
sheep and goat 
industry through the multiplication of animals and selective 
breeding of superior 
and resilient breeds.  -This is a strategic resource that 
the County could effectively harness to improve the productivity of sheep and goats.  
-The station needs to collaborate 
with the Kenya Livestock Breeders Association (KLBA) to determine and adapt breed 
standards for the local sheep 
and goat breeds.  
-The multiplication center 
should work together with other 
collaborators to provide livestock keepers with training in 
livestock monitoring and 
recording systems.  
Pasture Production Institutions  
i. Rehabilitation of Arid 
Environment Charitable Trust 
(RAE)  
ii. Kenya Agricultural and 
Livestock Research 
Organization (KARLO) Marigat  
iii. Kerio Valley Development 
Authority (KVDA)  
iv. Hay stores  Produce and supply 
grass and pasture 
seeds to livestock keepers.  -The county government could 
partner with the pasture production institutions to improve the establishment of 
drought -resistant varieties of 
pastures in the more Arid and 
semi -arid areas of the county.  
Livestock Fattening  
i. Kimose Livestock 
Improvement Centre  
ii. Chemogoch Fattening Centre  
iii. Elite livestock producers  These are areas set 
aside in the County for 
feeding and fattening of livestock either 
during the dry season 
or for preparation for 
the market.  
Elite livestock 
producers are model livestock keepers who invest in producing good quality animals for sale  -Expanded collaboration by the 
county with investors and other 
interested actors could enable more strategic use of livestock feeding and fattening programs, 
and enable better incomes for 
pastoral communities from their 
animals.  
-Farmer to farmer learning 
initiatives (eg exposure visits) could be used to educate livestock keepers on ways to 
improve their sheep and goat 
resources within their local 
contexts.  
Disease Control  
i. Disease -free zones  
ii. Dips and spray races  Disease -free zones are 
demarcated territories where surveillance, 
control, and 
biosecurity measures 
have been put in place -Measures in place for disease 
surveillance and biosecurity 
need to be more widely adopted 
so as to reduce the occurrence 
and spread of diseases.  
 
Page 7:
 
 
 Page 7 of 13   against important 
livestock diseases.  
 
Dips and spray races 
are constructed in different locations for communal control of 
disease vectors in the 
flocks.  -Enhanced operationalization 
and maintenance of community 
dips and spray races would improve livestock disease control.  
Veterinary Providers  
i. Veterinary input providers  
a. Agro dealers  
b. Agrovets -Chamtany, 
Mogotio  
ii. Private and public 
veterinary practitioners   
Supply inputs for 
livestock production  
 
Trained veterinary personnel support communities to control and treat various 
livestock diseases  -Access to inputs tends to be 
focused in the more urban areas of the county. There is need to develop and expand mechanisms of availing inputs 
and services among the more 
distant pastoral communities.  
Livestock Markets  
i. Sheep and goat product 
suppliers  
a. Slaughterhouses/slabs -
Maoi abattoir  
b. Butcheries  
c. Tanneries -Mogotio 
tannery (under construction)  
ii. Markets  
a. Barulessa  
b. Marigat  
c. Kimalel  
d. Nginany  
iii. Holding grounds and 
crushes   
Support the livestock 
keepers in the 
marketing of live 
animals, and of animal products such as meat, 
hides and skins.  
  
-Livestock keepers require 
training on the ways of 
accessing, disseminating, and 
utilizing livestock market information. This enables more 
optimal offtake and sale of 
animals.  
 -Slaughterhouses and butcheries 
need to be equipped with cold storage facilities such as deep 
freezers and cold stores.  
 
-Infrastructure in the main 
livestock markets needs to be 
repaired.  
Microfinance Service Providers  
i. Financial and insurance 
institutions  
a. Boresha Sacco  
b. Skyline Sacco  
c. Kenya Commercial 
Bank (KCB)  
d. Equity bank  
ii. Cooperatives and trade 
department   
Provide credit and 
finances for the livestock keepers  
 The cooperative 
institutions enable 
livestock keepers to 
have collective 
bargaining power, 
better access to markets and information, and training.  
  
Livestock keepers require additional education on the importance of having insurance schemes for their livestock.  
 
The financial and insurance 
institutions should aim to have 
loan and insurance packages tailored to suit the needs and financial capability of the pastoral livestock keepers.

operative s (MOALF)  
iii. Hand in Hand  
iv. The Kenya Climate Smart 
Agriculture Project (KCSAP)  
v. Agriculture Sector 
Development Support 
Programme (ASDSP)  These institutions are 
responsible for the 
formulation of policies and the provision of 
extension services to 
livestock keepers.  Technical personnel within these 
institutions should be supported to train farmers on community -
based climate -smart production 
of sheep and goats.  
 Stakeholders in sheep and goat production need to prioritize aspects of improving breeding 
and marketing systems to enable 
the livestock keepers to get 
better value from their livestock.  
4. Mapping stakeholders involved in the sheep and goat 
enterprises in pastoral areas  
The course participants also identified the specific actors involved in different nodes of sheep and 
goat enterprises and mapped them based on their  roles (Table 3 and Figure 1). The discussion 
around this activity enabled the participants to identify gaps and areas requiring intervention and 
capacity development at different levels.  
The need for adopting and integrating community -based innovations was evident. Participants 
committed themselves to engaging with and supporting the project team when community 
interactions would begin in the next phase of the program.

2 IRC Climate Resiliency – Anticipatory Action Pilot•Program : To reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies  and support  
households  to build  resilience  against  climate  shocks  by providing  climate  risk 
reduction  payments  and early  warning  messaging  to smallholder  farmers .
•Research : To assess  the effectiveness  of use of early  warning  systems  and 
anticipatory  cash  transfers  versus  post-shock  cash  transfers  to mitigate  the 
level of shock  and stress  experienced  by small  holder  farmers  in the event  of a 
hazardous  climatic  event
•Outcome : Households  reduce  the use of negative  coping  strategies,  improve  
food security  and income  and build  resilience  to climatic  shocks .Project Goals

Hypothesis, experiment and study area
Hypothesis
When  climate  vulnerable  communities  have  timely  access  to information  and the financial  
and social  resources  to act upon  that information,  they will avoid  negative  coping  strategies,  
build  more  diversified  and climate  resilient  livelihoods .
Experiment
•Provision  of information  – early  warning  messages  (flood  alert,  disaster  risk/emergency  
preparedness,  disaster  management  and CSA)
•Transfer  of a lump  sum cash  (₦195,000 (~400USD)  to 725 flood -prone  HHs when  triggered  
by the climate  data risk thresholds,  and same  No. HHs (‘control  group’)  received  equal  
amount  of cash  post shock .
Study  area
•Fufore  LGA,  Adamawa

Outcome1: 
Increase in climate 
adaptive actions 
Page 6:
Key results and implications
•Pre-shock  cash  payment  had significant  impacts  on:
•Household’s  rCSI and LCSI . HH less likely  to employ  negative  coping  strategies  in 
response  to the flood  shocks
•Labor  re-allocation  decisions  including  migration  of household  members . Generate  
additional  income  to meet  household  needs .
•Number  of pre-emptive  actions  households  took in anticipation  of flood  shocks .
•Long-term investment  decisions  on productive  agric . assets  and productive  livestock . 
This could  enhance  HH’s  future  income  generating  capacity  and reduce  their 
vulnerability  to future  shocks . Hence,  support  long-term resilience .
•No significant  difference  between  anticipatory  & post-shock  cash recipient  households  on 
FCS,  crop diversification,  mixed  crop-livestock  production,  and post-shock  actions  taken . 
Page 7:
Recommendations
•Given  the generally  positive  findings  on climate  resilience  capacity  and investment,  we 
suggest   humanitarian  agencies  and governments  to consider  anticipatory  interventions  
(such  as pre-shock  cash  transfers)  as a mechanism  for both meeting  basic  needs  (i.e., 
food consumption)  and improving  climate  resilience  of households . 
•As climate  shocks  continue  to worsen  and humanitarian  funding  needs  remain  unmet,  
anticipatory  interventions  may be critical  to meeting  the needs  of climate - and conflict -
affected  households .

•Conflict  remains  a major  driver  of poverty  in Africa   and conflicts  and political  
instabilities  have been increasing . 
•Explore  the relationship  between  violent  conflicts ; and farmers’  crop land; the share  of 
area planted  and harvested . 
•Implications  of conflict  on household’s  crop choices  and land allocation  decisions . 
•Explore  whether  conflict  shocks  influence  a shift from  high-investment  activities  to 
subsistence  activities .
•The relationship  between  violent  conflicts  and access  to community  services
Page 11:
www.cgiar.orgThe Data
•Geocoded  longitudinal  dataset  based  on an agricultural  survey  administered  in 
Nigeria  across  the three -wave  LSMS -ISA panel  survey . 
•Measured  conflicts  exposure  using  the number  of fatalities  associated  with incidents .
•Farmer’s  land allocation  was measured  using  the share  of area planted  in major  
crops  to total land area cultivated
•Based  on this measure,  we estimate  the effect  of violent  conflicts  on several  crop 
choice  and sales decisions . 
    
Page 12:
www.cgiar.orgKey Descriptive Findings
•Most  of the households  (70%) were  into cereals  production,  38% produced  legumes,  38% 
produced  roots,  while  very few (7%) produced  trees. 
•High  conflict  states : lower  percentage  of hired  labor  and lower  percentage  of purchase  of 
agricultural  inputs
•Land  area planted  with cereals  was higher  in high than in the low conflict  states .
•Area  covered  by roots  and trees is higher  in low than in high conflict  states . 
•HHs in low conflict  states  are more  likely  to engage  in wage  employment  & higher  market  
flexibility . 
Page 13:
www.cgiar.orgKey Empirical Findings
•Conflicts  reduced  land area dedicated  to longer -term crops  but increase  the share  of land 
area dedicated  to short -term crops  such as cereals . 
•Conflicts  reduced  the shares  of land area covered  with crops . Prolonged  conflict  may 
push HHs to exploit  a lower  % of their land for productive  activities
•Significantly  reduce  the shares  of agricultural  land harvested . 
•Conflicts  has a negative  significant  effect  on farmers  access  to market  and cooperatives .
•Negative  direct  effect  on investment  (area  planted,  area harvested)  and indirect  
(destruction  and disruption  of community  services)  
Page 14:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions
Violent conflicts affect land 
allocation patterns and cropping 
patterns, reducing land area 
allocated to longer -term crops 
such as trees and legumes that 
are amenable to longer -term soil 
management practices. 
Violent conflicts reduce market 
participation and hence induces 
production -oriented to satisfy 
own consumption.

Evaluation Questions
1.What is the productivity change gain for PBR cowpea compared to a conventional 
variety?
2.What is the effect of PBR cowpea on insecticide applications?
3.Does reduction in pesticide application translate to better health indicators for farmers 
and their families? 
4.Does the cultivation of PBR cowpea change household consumption of cowpea and/or 
increase cowpea surpluses? 
5.What are the heterogeneous impacts of PBR cowpea adoption by gender, age, and 
other household characteristics?

Page 23:
What is WEAGov ?
-WEAGov  – the Women’s Empowerment in Agrifood Governance 
tool – is an assessment framework to measure women’s voice in 
the agrifood policy process
-Developed by International Food Policy Research Institute 
(IFPRI) researchers and piloted in Nigeria by APRNet
-How can WEAGov  be used?
1.Measure women’s voice across different parts of the policy 
process
2.Identify entry points for raising women’s voice in different 
parts of the policy process
3.Track progress in women’s empowerment in agrifood policy 
process over time
Page 24:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
Page 25:

Women make up only 22%  of 
members of parliament 
worldwide…
… and only 16%  of 
cabinet secretaries
Page 26:
Why did we create WEAGov ?
-The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
calls fo r gender equality and highlights gaps in political 
participation for women  
-Gender equality within agrifood systems is essential to meeting 
SDGs, yet it is difficult to measure and track
-There is a need to identify specific windows and opportunities to 
raise women’s voice in the agrifood policy process in order to 
achieve meaningful progress
Page 27:
WEAGov  covers 3 stages of the policy 
process
Agenda setting, 
Policy design, and 
Policy adoption 
Policy

reformAgenda setting, Policy design, 
and Policy adoption : 
•Why certain social and 
economic problems emerge 
as topics for policy debate
•How policy solutions are

•Which policy solutions are 
ultimately adopted
Policy implementation
•How policies are implemented 
in practice, including 
budgetary outlays, 
organizational strategies, and 
delivery of servicesPolicy evaluation & reform
•How policies are assessed 
against their objectives to 
know if changes are needed
Page 28:
www.cgiar.orgAt each stage of the policy process, WEAGov  
focused on 3 key questions

How is WEAGov data collected? 
5 key measurement steps
▪Agrifood policy & stakeholder mapping → policy content analysis on gender 
integration and analysis of organizations involved in agrifood policy process
▪Desk review of objective, quantitative indicators of women’s empowerment in 
agrifood governance 
-e.g., # women ministers of agrifood agencies
▪Organization survey 
-Quantitative, objective data on staffing, gender strategies, gender activities of agrifood 
organizations
-Survey given to organizations involved in agrifood policy process – public sector (federal 
and state), private sector, and civil society organizations 
▪Expert survey 
-Perceptions and beliefs of key in -country stakeholders in the sector
-e.g., are opportunities for women’s participation well -known and utilized by key civil 
society actors  
-Survey given to leaders and experts in organizations in the agrifood policy process 
▪Technical panels or focus group discussions  
-Deliberate on measurement and validity with country experts

www.cgiar.orgIntroduction
•Government policies affect everyone, yet 
women are underrepresented in policymaking 
(Duflo 2012; Lawless 2015)
•Women’s participation in politics and civic life 
remains comparatively low (Iversen and 
Rosenbluth 2006)
•Reasons may include a lack of relevant skills and 
training, or norms that proscribe such behavior
•Worrisome as:
•Women’s unique policy needs may not be met if they lack voice and agency
•Women’s voice and agency in their community also help support women’s livelihoods

The Role of Spatial Inequalities on Youth Migration 
Decisions: Empirical Evidence from Nigeria
Mulubrhan Amare 
(with Kibrom A. Abay and Jordan Chamberlin )
Page 47:
www.cgiar.orgMotivation 
•The spatial  flow of labor  within  countries  responds  and contributes  to the geographical  
distribution  of economic  activity  and opportunity .
•Understanding  migration  decisions,  destination  and duration  helps  inform  our 
understanding  of the potential  outcomes  of alternative  regional  development  strategies . 
•How  different  types  of migrants  respond  to differences  in amenities,  resources,  and 
economic  activity,  to design  effective  policies  for migration,  
•Destination  perspective  to understanding  potential  pull factors  for various  forms  of 
migration
•Examine  how the attributes  of potential  destinations,  both in absolute  terms  as well as 
relative  to origins  of migration .
Page 48:
www.cgiar.orgObjectives
▪W e study youth migrants’ responses to observable characteristics of potential destinations 
and how these responses vary across various forms of migration.
▪Examine the role of observable attributes of potential destinations, both in absolute terms as 
well as relative to origin of migration.
▪Explore potential heterogeneity in the impacts of observable characteristics of potential 
destinations across various types of migrants. 
▪Understand pull factors of youth migration, a country characterized by relatively high rates 
of internal youth migration
▪Dyadic comparison of destinations and origins underscores the analytical importance of 
relative distributions of endowments.

•There are 3,140 youth migrants to each state. 
•Each of the migrants has chosen to move to one potential destination; and has therefore 
chosen not to move to the 36 remaining destinations. 
•Interested in explaining why each individual migrated to each actual destination and not to

Destination choice of migrants by destination characteristics 
Page 51:
www.cgiar.orgConclusions and Implications 
•Migrants  respond  differently  to observable  characteristics  depending  on migration  pattern,  
duration,  and socioeconomic  status .

What drives farmers, consumers and private sector decisions to 
adopt new varieties and related products?
The problem: New varieties (even if the best ones) are 
often not adopted because of behavioral barriers and 
processes. Examples:
•Benefits from drought -tolerant varieties only 
experienced when there is a drought
•Improved nutritional value: Difficult to observe
With these barriers, how to accelerate varietal 
turnover?
Limited or unpredictable demand will limit private sector 
interest in promoting new varieties and related products.
•How to get private sector to promote new products?
Page 54:
Research Question 1 – How can we accelerate varietal turnover?Main Investment: A behavioral multi -country multi -crop randomized trial
•Six experiments (5 countries) 
•Coordinated experimental designs – common interventions
•Quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, and the same outcome variables.
•Nigeria: Baseline survey completed and seed trial minipack distribution started 
Sites and crops: 
•Nigeria: cowpea, maize
•Ethiopia: teff and wheat
•India: green gram, groundnut, rice
•Kenya: maize, beans, cowpea, green 
gram, sorghum
•Uganda: maize, sweet potato (2 sites)

Study site: Bauchi and Kaduna states, Nigeria 
Sample size: 2,016 households in 252 villages surveyed at baseline
Constraints to adoption of newer 
varieties: 
•Lack of information about new 
varieties
•Farmers are cautious to try out new 
varieties
•Lack of access to improved seeds
•Poor management practices
•Gender -based constraints
❖Women have low access to information, 
improved seeds, inputs, mobility
❖Women lack decision -making in varietal 
selection and farmingInterventions being

1•This study explores the value of  quality assurance systems 
with an analysis of  certified seed production and 
distribution in Nigeria.
•Assess the associations between the quantity of  certified 
seeds produced and the spatial variations from where they 
are produced and,
•Spatial variations in the use of  certified seeds and/or 
improved varieties, yields, and output, and their relationship 
with agroclimatic and socioeconomic conditions

www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
4•Yield responses from certified seeds vary depending on the nature of  the farmland 
•When certified seeds are available, both yield and use increase. When it hits its peak, 
the effect of  the increase begins to diminish. 
•There are variations in the yields from certified seed which could be a result of  
climatic conditions and farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics.
•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
Page 64:
www.cgiar.orgKey Findings
5•Farmers tend to use certified seeds when they are sure that their land supports the 
production of  such crops.
•Farmers in close proximity to certified seed use it and improve their yields and 
outputs. This effect diminishes at the margin due to two factors
1.Yields from certified seeds vary considerably within each state, suggesting either 
quality issues in the supply chain or farmers not using complementary inputs or 
management practices when using quality seed.
2.As certified seed becomes more available to farmers, its use may spread from 
higher -return farms to lower -return farms, thereby diminishing the gains on the 
extensive margin.
Page 65:
www.cgiar.orgPolicy recommendations 
6•Revisit seed certification target in Nigeria
•Prioritize spatially the seed certification expansion effort if  it 
is still of  policy importance
•Promote more decentralized systems, like QDS / community 
seed schemes for rice, cowpeas, and OPV maize (as in various 
Eastern and Southern African countries)

Introduction to SAM
➢SAM  is a systematic  tool for economy -wide  analysis  and policy  prioritization,  used  to 
prioritize  the most  appropriate  investments  and suitable  policies  that can transform  the 
Nigerian  agricultural  food  market  and system .
➢SAM  is a national  accounting  framework  that captures  the circular  flow  of receipts  and 
payments  between  agents  and markets . 
➢SAM  provides  a complete  and consistent  dataset  of all economic  transactions  that takes  
place  within  the socio -economic  system .
➢Some  of the data  source  include : National  accounts  (NBS),  government  financial  statistics  
(Ministry  of Finance,  CBN),  Balance  of Payment  (IMF)  Household  expenditures,  and Labour  
Force  Surveys  etc.
Page 68:
Basic Structure of SAM
➢It sheds  light  on the activities  of the different  
economic  agents  by describing  the 
interrelationship  between  firms,  farms,  
households,  investors  and the external  sector .
➢The flow  of economic  activities  in monetary  terms  
from  expenditure/outflow  (col)  to income/inflow  
(row)
➢Activities  are domestic  firms  that  produce  goods  
and services  (commodities) . Factors  (labour , 
capital  and land)  are important  to produce  
activities . The activities  pay owners/suppliers  of 
factors  (households  – wages  and rents),  
government  (profits,  direct  tax),  and the rest of 
the world  (import,  debt  repayments)

Through an iterative process a qualitative analysis of existing pathways leading from climate-related risks to forms of insecurity and conflict, has been complemented vis a vis a network analysis of exisiting academic literature on Web of Science, to explore outlooks for future research on climate security in Somalia. The analysis identified five preliminary pathways and their potential research gaps: Resource Access and Availability; Livelihood and Food Insecurity; Disaster and Conflict Displacement; Armed Groups Tactics and Exploration; Social Vulnerability and Fragility. In the proposed next steps, the research will qualitatively assess the identified links within the pathways, validate findings in an expert consultation and establish a confidence scaling of the research available.

Within varietal turnover, CGIAR, through the Genetic Innovation Action Area and initiatives like Seed Equal and the AVISA project, takes the lead in tracking this crucial metric. Over the years, CGIAR has introduced numerous innovations, with diverse crop varieties being a pivotal intervention. While interventions undergo rigorous evaluation and progress through stages such as farmer and stakeholder assessment, breeding, bulking, and commercialization, tracking the variety age has faced some challenges. Alternative estimation methods have emerged to address this, with the weighted average varietal age (WAVA) being one such approach. As we delve deeper into understanding varietal turnover, the evidence gathered from initiatives like AVISA and applying methodologies like WAVA offer a robust foundation. Moving forward, continued collaboration and refinement of tracking methods will be essential to enhance the accuracy and applicability of varietal turnover calculations.  ","355"

 Executive Summary  
Agriculture is central for economic growth, reducing poverty, and ensuring food security in East and 
Southern Africa. In Ethiopia alone,  agriculture contribut es to 36 % of the GDP and employs more than 
two-thirds of the population. Ethiopian women are important stakeholders in the agribusiness value 
chain  constituting more than 60% of agricultural labour force. Despite their contribution, women face 
unique challenges such as poor access to resources and farm  input s, credit, technologies, markets and 
poor decision -making power. Moreover, the high domestic and care responsibilities of wom en add to 
their workload and limit the time available for agribusiness. These barriers hamper women’s capacity 
for productive agriculture, which in turn impedes the country’s agriculture potential . There is a gender 
gap in productivity of land between female - and male -managed farms of the same size is 24 percent. 
Women earn 18.4% less than men from agriculture.  
Like gender inequality in agriculture, youth unemployment is a critical challenge  in realising economic 
growth and poverty reduction in many developing countries. Despite the high potential of agriculture 
in absorbing rural youth, those engaged in the sector experience challenges similar to those 
experienced by women: limited access to land, farm inputs, technologies, lack of information and 
credit. In Ethiopia, rural youths face severe constraints in accessing farm land, water and finances, 
which is said t o discourage them from pursuing agriculture as a livelihood strategy.  
Gender inequality and multiple dimensions of youth and social exclusion perpetuate and contribute 
to poverty and food insecurity, which is exacerbated also by the impact of climate change. To achieve 
the core goals of sustainable development in low and middle -income countries, it is imperative for 
agricultural policy, research and interventions to be more inclusive, so that the needs and priorities of 
women and youth are more intentionally addressed.  
To map existing challenges that limit the participation of women and youth, and the ways in which 
these barriers are being addressed in an on -going program “Veggies for People and Planet” of the 
World Vegetable Center, a stakeholder consultation wo rkshop was conducted by the CGIAR Initiatives  
on Diversification in East and Southern Africa ( Ukama Ustawi ) and Gender Equality on 31 January 2023 
at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The workshop also 
aimed to investigate existing opportunities and recommend possible integrated solutions for more 
equitable and inclus ive value chain development. The specific objectives of the workshop were as 
follows:  
1. Identifying major challenges in agricultural value chains with respect to gender equality and 
social inclusion  
2. Identify socio -technical  innovation bundles that can build the resilience and  empower 
farmers  across the vegetable value chain  
3. Mapping possible opportunities for women and youth participation in agricultural value 
chains and  
4. Networking with key public, private and civil society stakeholders, and providing an 
opportunity for experience  sharing  by women and youth agri -entrepreneurs.  
In Ethiopia some policy reforms such as family law, land policy and institutional changes were made 
to improve women’s access to land through joint titling. To assist the integration of  youths in 
agriculture some limited funds were provided. In the same manner, access to free farm land is 
guaranteed by law to all residents including youths. The World Vegetable Center (World Veg) has been

 promoting women and youth within the vegetable value chain in partnership with the Stichting 
Nederlandse Vrijwilligers (SNV), focusing on capacity building, providing farm inputs and creating 
market linkages. The other interesting thing is that the interest of youths in taking part in agriculture 
is increas ing than ever before. We are now seeing some youths who seeing modern agriculture based 
on Information Communication Technology (ICT) as an opportunity to harness their innovations and 
willingness to expe riment with in new farming approaches. In general, from the project 
implementation activities in Ethiopia, one  can see some enabling environments for increasing women 
and youth’s participation that can be maximized and used if well targeted to achieve agricultural 
growth and achieve food security.  
In practice more equitable and inclusive agricultural value chain development is still a long way to be 
achieved. Firstly, there is a need for better coordinated policies and interventions and a better 
engagements between different stakeholder (national to  local levels, private and public sectors) 
interventions. Secondly, there is a need to conduct grounded research within the vegetable value 
chains and identify socio -technical bundling opportunities. Thirdly, it is important to engage within a 
feminist pol itical ecology perspective in order to move towards a Gender Transformative Approach. 
The workshop participants felt that improved  coordination  is fundamental to ensuring more 
sustainable and inclusive outcomes across the agricultural value chain.

 Introduction  
In Ethiopia, agriculture employs 85%  of the population, 70% of the export  earnings,  75% of the raw 
materials for industries1 and accounts for 36% of the GDP as of 20202. Vegetable production is an 
important component of agriculture in the country with a production system ranging from homestead 
gardening, and smallholder to commercial farming3. On average the vegetable production consist of 
1% of the national GDP4 and employs 5.7 million smallholder farmers cultivating over an estimated 
0.44 million hectares of land5,6. The country exported 0.22 million tonnes of vegetables and earned 
USD 438 million in one financial year. Despite its contribution, agriculture including vegetable 
production as an economic activity is constrained by various challenges including climate c hange, low 
yield, traditional farming system, poor finance, lack of market information, and poor infrastructure 
and limited extension services among others. As a result, most of the production remains subsistence 
which is inadequate to feed the growing pop ulation.  
Women and youths are key actors in agricultural commodity value chain7. Women are responsible for 
producing more than half of the world food8. However, most of the time women agriculturalists do 
not have access to and control over productive resources and associated benefits due to low 
production and productivity, skewed gender relations to access land, lack of improved seeds, inputs, 
market information, and credit and storage facilities and, a changing cl imate that comes with 
insufficient and irregular rainfall9. Whilst some of the outlined challenges also apply to men, they are 
more pronounced for female farmers. These challenges are not only affecting women but also the 
agricultural production in turn contributing to growth of poverty and food insecurity.  
Youth unemployment is another critical challenge in the rural area of the developing world. Although, 
agriculture including vegetable production has a great potential to provide employment for the 
growing young generation10 a lot of factors are hindering their active participation. These include poor 
access to farming land, lack of finance and other inputs for agri -business. Therefore, for reducing youth 
unemployment through improving their engagement in agriculture we need to address these 
gendered barriers. This is possible by developing inclusive agricultural value chain development.  
This stakeholder workshop was conducted to identify major challenges and opportunities in the 
agricultural value chain with regard to gender equality and social inclusion. The workshop  brought 
together youths and women agricultural producers, researchers, people working in different 
government organizations, donors and NGOs. In the selection of the participants,  we considered the

 gender and age balance as much as possible, particularly in the selection of farmers.  This aimed at 
ensuring a more inclusive stakeholder consultation process.  
From the discussion, the main challenges limiting participation in the agricultural value chain with 
regard to gender equality and social inclusion were identified as poor access to land, lack of 
appropriate farm technologies, limited access to improved seeds, limi ted market information, 
restrictive social norms and the time poverty for women. Thus, our agricultural research, policy and 
interventions need to address these problems to improve the participation of women and youth in 
agribusiness and contribute to the development of inclusive vegetable value chains. Despite the 
challenges mentioned, the participants also revealed various opportunities like policy initiatives 
towards women empowerment and inclusive development, growing interest of women and youth in 
agriculture than before, NGOs, Information Communication Technologies (ICT) application in 
agriculture and Donors working on the area and the availability of local agricultural input dealers as 
prospects in improving the participation of women and youth in veg etable value chains.  
Part I Opening remarks and keynote Address  
The facilitator of the workshop welcomed all the participants and invited them for a short self -
introduction (their name, organization they work and their responsibility). From the self -introduction, 
we came to know that the participants were women and you th farmers, government employees 
(Ministry of Agriculture, Addis Ababa City Administration, Ethiopian agricultural research centre, 
Agricultural Transformation Institute (ATI), Nifas Silk Lafto urban agriculture office, Wolmera, Woliso 
and Ejere woredas of  agriculture offices), NGO (SNV), donor (global affairs Canada), World Vegetable 
Center (WorldVeg) and CGIAR centers (International Water Management Institute (IWMI, 
International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) ,  Alliance Bioversity -CIAT (ABC), International Center for 
Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA)  and International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). 
Most of the participants in one way or another are working on agricultural value chain development 
with regard to gender equality and socia l inclusion. Annex 1 shows a list of the in person and the virtual 
participants.

 After the short introduction of the participants the facilitator asked Dr Amare Haile Haileslassie, 
Principal Scientist at IWMI to make opening remarks. Dr Amare thanked all the participants for coming 
and conveyed that IWMI is happy to host the workshop a t the ILRI -Campus. He also gave a brief 
overview on IWMIs research and engagement in improving access to water, food and sustainable land 
management for people in Africa and Asia. Finally, he concluded his remarks by wishing all participants 
a fruitful day . 
Objectives of the Workshop  
The aim of the workshop was to identify the systematic barriers, available opportunities and areas for 
intervention in agricultural value chain with regard to gender equality and social inclusion.  
Specifically, the workshop objectives were:  
1. Identifying major challenges in agricultural value chains with respect to gender equality and 
social inclusion  
2. Identify socio -technical  innovation bundles that can build the resilience of and empower  
farmers across the vegetable value chain  
3. Mapping possible opportunities for women and youth participation in agricultural value 
chains and  
4. Networking with key public, private and civil society stakeholders, and providing an 
opportunity for experience -sharing by women and youth agri -entrepreneurs.  
Keynote I: Overview of Ukama Ustawi (UU) Initiative  
Dr Inga Jacobs -Mata the Regional Representative, IWMI, Southern Africa gave a virtual presentation 
on the overview of the UU project, one of CGIAR regional initiatives which covers Eastern and Southern 
Africa Region.  
The initiative focuses on the maize mixed system under changing climate in the region. It works on 
scaling up technologies in a more inclusive and coordinated manner to help One CGIAR to achieve its 
goal of creating sustainable food systems and sufficientl y feeding the population through 
diversification of maize as a mixed farming and understanding challenges though consultation 
workshops like this one keeping gender and social inclusion at the heart of the initiative (See Annex 
2). 
Keynote II: Overview on UU Work package 5  
The second keynote speaker was Dr Deepa Joshi from Work package 5,  one of the UU work packages 
titled Engage and Empower . WP5 focuses on how to address the structural inequality between 
different social groups particularly on women and youths. She stated the structural barriers of women 
and youths in agriculture need to be identified, and addressed to bring transformational  change. 
Finally, she noted that, women and youths are different . Thus, we need to better understand the 
needs and priorities of women and youths (See Annex 3).

 Keynote speaker III: Overview on Gender Equality   
Dr Ranjitha Puskur of CGIAR’s Gender Equality Initiative, co -hosting the workshop was  the third 
keynote speaker of the day.  She virtually  presented ideas on harnessing gender and social equality 
for resilienc e in agri -food system. The initiative aims to address the deeply entrenched gender 
inequalities in food, water and land systems that limit the potential of women to be empowered and 
build social, economic and technologica l resilience to climate change . It works on the four dimensions 
of inequality such as agency, resource access, social norms and policy. Dr. Puskur particularly 
presented Work Package 2 of Gender Equality : EMPOWER: Bundle d innovations for women’s 
empowerment) (See Annex 4) . 
Keynote speaker IV: Overview on Veggies 4 planet and people  
The fourth keynote speaker was Dr. Ralph Roothaert, Principal Investigator for the project Veggies 4 
Planet and People. He gave his presentation on the achieved socio -economic benefits of the project 
for women and youths undertaken by WorldVeg in Kenya and Ethiopia in partnership with Gender 
Equality  and UU initiatives.  
The aim of this project is enabling vegetable business development in East Africa to create more jobs, 
better human and environmental health. This project engages national and local authorities, research 
organisations, NGOs in Ethiopia with (Stich ting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers) SNV, vegetable producers 
and entrepreneurs with the aim of creating job opportunities and increasing income for women and 
youths. He noted that some farmers from the project intervention areas participated in the workshop.  
The project works on  
● Vegetable Business Networks (VBN) (group of people working around vegetable business 
champions who engage in collective action to access information, credit, inputs) - this is both 
an approach as well as a target in the project .  
● Regenerative technologies in a context of circular agriculture (soil, water, integrated pest 
management which are part of the food system) to build a resilient food system.  
Finally, he presented the work done so far by Veggies 4 planet and people  in both countries. He 
highlighted that 200 networks have been organized with 5000 members and  160 business coaches. 
Activities on, promoting organic market is being conducted, the promotion of the adoption of 
regenerative technologies and a lot of sales were made. The project created job for about 3000 
people in both countries, mainly for women and  youth.  
The enabling factors that contributed for the success of the project include market availability nearby, 
positive group dynamics, commitment of women, lead farmers and business coaches  and the  high 
interest of farmers in regenerative technologies . The youths are  also fa st adopters of technologies 
and women have benefited through engaging in vegetable production.

Part II. Experiences from Ethiopia  
Overview on Ethiopian Women Network for Gender Equality in Agriculture 
(ENGEA)  
Ms Selamawit Firdisa, from Agricultural Transformation Institute (ATI), gave a short presentation on 
Ethiopian Network for Gender Equality in Agriculture where she serves as a one of the board of 
directors.  The Ethiopian Network for Gender Equality in Agr iculture is a network of partners that work 
on gender equality in the agriculture sector. It was established in the year 2015 by 200 members from 
government organizations, development partners, NGOS, consultants, researchers and experts 
working on gender a nd agriculture. The Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Women and Social 
Affairs directorate leads the network with ATI and UN Women as co -chairs. It focuses on learning and 
sharing to build knowledge and increase efficiency and coordination in program  and policy 
implementation. In the network, the members share experiences, and bring together  available efforts 
toward ensuring gender equality in agriculture. In addition, network organizes national and 
international workshops and field trips for experien ce sharing on gender and agriculture.

Experiences from the ground: Farmers experience sharing  
1. John  is a young male farmer from Welmera district who shared his lived experiences as follows. 
Similar to many children, during his childhood, he had a dream to be a medical doctor – which he 
thought would help him move out of agriculture - his family’s livelihood.  
When he reached his teenage years and could not succeed in his education, he started to expl ore 
other livelihood options. One day , he met an SNV staff in Welmera district who was  working for 
Veggies 4 Planet and People program  specifically targeting the improvement of  youth’s  participation 
in vegetable production. He was included in a project as a beneficiary and was trained on regenerative 
agriculture and preparation of organic fertilizer. That is when he decided to rent his family’s land,treat 
and use i t for improved production with the skills that he had been trained. He said, ‘ I changed the 
dream of treating humans to treating the soil ’. Based on the training he received Wendwsen started 
to prepare organic compost and applying it on the land and started producing different types of 
vegetables. He even started selling organic  fertilizer he produced . 
Currently he is producing different types of crops and vegetables using organic inputs. His agricultural 
products are sold at Addis Ababa market and also distributed to restaurants. He is doing well and seen 
as a role model among the youths in his communit y. He prepares and uses entrepreneurial  skills  for 
his agricultural operation. Some of the youths in his neighbourhood has already started emulating  
him. However, the road to agri -business is not smooth particularly for youths who have no direct right 
Page 12:

 over land. In addition, other challenges such as lack of awareness of organic products among the 
society, the low price for organic products, lack of organic seed, diseases and pests, lack of finance 
and poor market linkage are the pressing problems that n eed serious attention.  
Nevertheless, to overcome these challenges, the organic farmers are organised into cooperatives 
(networks). In their network, they have collective savings, time for learning from each other, 
discussions on how to promote their products using social media, multiply organic seed s on their 
respective farms and distribute among other members. From the training he received, all his farm 
activities are pre -planned and guided by well-prepared  business plan.  
2. A woman  from the same district shares her experience. She is also one of the beneficiaries of 
Veggies 4 Planet and People Project. She is a married woman engaged in farming. She received training 
on regenerative agriculture, preparation of organic fertilizer and on networking to improve 
agricultural production.  
Although she is interested in applying her new knowledge in her agricultural production, things were 
not as easy as she thought it would be.  Her husband was not interested and did not want to invest in 
the new agricultural practice she had learnt. Neverth eless, she did not lose hope; rather she used her 
own small personal savings to start producing organic fertilizer on a small plot and sold it for 13,000 
Ethiopian Birr which she felt was a lot to achieve for her . She also engaged in vegetable production 
and expanded her farming business. This helps her to improve her and her family's living condition. 
Her husband has also started encouraging and giving all the necessary support after he realized the 
benefits from her new business. However, she still contin ues to face challenges  like water shortage, 
low availability of improved organic seeds disease and pest infestation of crops, lack of premium price 
for organic products, lack of consumer  awareness on organic products. Thus, for improving 
participation of w omen and youths in agri -business these challenges need to be addressed.  
3. The third farmer for the experience sharing was Mary . She is a young female farmer from another 
SNV project area -Walliso Woreda  and a beneficiary of the Veggies for the Planet  and People Project. 
Desta is one of the youths who received training on regenerative agriculture and vegetable business 
network development from SNV. Afterwards, the project offered to distribute verm -worms u sed to 
prepare compost as inputs to its beneficiaries. However, almost all the trainees were afraid  and 
refused to accept the w orm.  Later on, after a long  discussion Desta  and her friends accepted  the 
worms and started using them to prepare  compost on their land which was further  used  to grow 
vegetables. Today she is producing different types of organic vegetables for the market . She is making 
good money from selling both vegetables and compost.  
 
All the farmers in the two districts mentioned that there are initiatives from government and 
nongovernmental organizations to improve the participation of women and youths in agricultural 
activities now than it was ever before. However, some of the critical challenges such as lack of land 
ownership, water shortage, diseases and pests, poor access to finance, lack of access to improved  
seeds particularly for vegetables, poor market access are hindering the participation. Thus, addressing 
these issues will not only increase the number of women and youths in agriculture but also most likely 
would increase their production and productivity  and in turn contribute to ensuring food security and 
reducing poverty.

 Part III Challenges & opportunities in agricultural/ vegetable/ value chain 
with respect to GESI  
After the farmers’ experience sharing, all the participants were divided into four groups: (1) Farmer 
group (2) Government group (3) NGOs and Donors (4) Research group. Each group was given the same 
points of discussion which later on was presented by a representative of the  group (See Table 1).  
The points to be discussed in the groups were to identify the following: - 
(1) Major challenges women and youth face in the vegetable value chain,  
(2) Opportunities for improving their participation,  
(3) Possible  Areas of intervention and  
(4) Key stakeholders to ensure gender equality and social inclusion in the vegetable value chain.  
5) Possible elements of socio -technical innovation bundles that can enhance resilience and 
empowerment of men and women farmers in the vegetable value chain  
The results from the group discussions revealed that the vegetable value chain has different 
challenges with respect to gender equality and social inclusion. This included social, economic, policy 
and institutional challenges. Despite the challenges, there  are also different prospects for building 
inclusive vegetable value chain development. Table 1 summarizes the discussions held by all groups.

The aim of the workshops was twofold: 1) To understand both the present image and the future vision of the Nandi County Food System citizens of different stakeholder groups and in relation to lowering emissions in the food system, and 2) To understand the meaning of low-emission food systems for the stakeholders, and factors impacting low-emission food systems in the Nandi County. The participants were purposively selected based on a desk review to uncover key stakeholders, who are instrumental in the food system of Nandi County. These organizations and individuals were invited to participate because of their role in the food system of Nandi County.

The aim of the workshops was twofold: 1) To understand both the present image and the future vision of the Nandi County Food System citizens of different stakeholder groups and in relation to lowering emissions in the food system, and 2) To understand the meaning of low-emission food systems for the stakeholders, and factors impacting low-emission food systems in the Nandi County. The first week, it was government, NGO and private sector stakeholders, the second week farmers, farmer groups and cooperatives, representing also women and youth in agriculture. The participants were purposively selected based on a desk review to uncover key stakeholders, who are instrumental in the food system of Nandi County. These organizations and individuals were invited to participate because of their role in the food system of Nandi County.

Introduction 
The workshop was organized by the CGIAR Research Initiative on Low-Emission Food Syst ems 
(MITIGATE+) , which is implemented by a large consortium of par tners. The Initiative aims to reduce annual 
global food systems emissions by working closely wi th key actors in target countries to co-create 
knowledge that enables them to make evidence-based decisions and address challenges in food systems 
discourse, policy development, and implementation t o reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
The Initiative’s partners support the establishment  of a multistakeholder platform and a “living lab f or 
people” (LL4P) that will support bottom-up innovati on cases to help transform food systems in Nandi 
county, Kenya, while also reducing greenhouse gas e missions.  
The workshop was part of a series of stakeholder wo rkshops that aims to help clarify development 
opportunities, the role of different actors in Nand i county, and their interests. The intention was to  bring 
actors together, invite them to think about a joint  vision for food systems in the county, and share 
perspectives on entry points for initiating system change. 
Attendance and logistics 
The workshop was attended by 26 participants, inclu ding 10 government representatives, 10 farmers, 2 
civil society members, 2 private sector representat ives, and 2 community leaders. Consent to voluntari ly 
participate and to collect and use data, recordings , and pictures was obtained from all participants a fter 
explaining the workshop agenda to them. Detailed no tes of all activities were taken. Each participant 
received two snacks and lunch on each workshop day in addition to compensation for transport (see 
financial report on workshop). There were no compla ints about the logistics or meals. 
Revision of actor network 
The process of reflecting on a theory of change for  the county’s food systems began with netmaps that 
were developed in a workshop on December, 7, 2022, in Kapsabet. Stakeholders developed three 
netmaps for the county’s food systems, and. The fac ilitators chose one as the basis for discussion dur ing 
the February workshop. It was emphasized that none of the netmaps were better or worse, but that the 
one chosen for discussion included more complex rel ations between actors. Participants were asked to 
review the netmap and propose revisions (Figure 1).

Participants proposed adding a few actors, though a ll of them were rated as having low influence. The 
most important revision was that information mostly  flows in both directions, and government 
organizations especially depend on information from  other actors. 
Constellation of current actor network 
In the next step, the participants engaged in an em bodiment exercise to envision potential and sense a  
desired future. This was facilitated using an organ izational constellation approach called 4D mapping 
(Hayashi 2021),1 which helped participants to think creatively abou t actor relations and system 
dynamics. 
The facilitators presented nine influential actors from the list of stakeholders in the netmap. In the ir 
discussion, the participants asked to add providers  of agrochemical inputs as an important influential  
actor, and they dropped the One Acre Fund. The fina l list of actors included: 
1.  Farmers 
2.  Farmer groups and cooperatives 
3.  Consumers 
4.  County Department of Agriculture 
5.  Agriculture Fisheries & Food Authority (AFFA) 
6.  Seed companies 
7.  Food marketers

9.  Providers of agrochemical inputs 
One actor after another was called to the stage and  participants chose an actor to embody. A constella tion 
emerged after all actors entered the space where th ey faced each other in a circle. Notably, the farme r 
knelt and lowered her gaze, the farmer cooperative representative sat beside the farmer, and the food 
marketer stood with open arms, embracing everybody (Figure 2).  
The actors changed positions as they were invited t o move. The farmer moved through the network away 
from the farmer cooperative and knelt next to the c onsumers. 
The participants who embodied the actors made the f ollowing key observations: 
 The farmers experienced many challenges, including low productivity, weather, markets, and lack 
of knowledge. 
 The food marketer felt he represented the farmers. He needed everyone to get the best products 
and had strong bargaining power. 
 The county government representative searched for a n unbiased way to support and coordinate 
the activities of various stakeholders. 
 The seed company representative felt disconnected f rom the farmers and cooperatives.  
 The farmer cooperative sat down so that others coul d approach him. 
 The agrochemical provider worked by educating other s about the chemical contents and how to 
use the inputs.

The participants who observed the embodiment exerci se made the following key observations: 
 Every stakeholder played a role. All actors depende d on each other although they had different 
levels of influence. They needed each other.  
Page 5:

 The farmer was the main focus although she seemed d esperate and appeared to be crying. The 
farmer should not be suffering. Farmers should be h appy despite their challenges. 
 The county government should keep the rest of the a ctors in check. 
 The actors were well-informed and knew what to do. 
 Capacity building was needed for farmers who lack k nowledge. 
These observations represent the perspectives of th e exercise participants. 
Visioning 
In this step, participants were asked to develop a shared vision for the future of Nandi county’s food  
systems. The MITIGATE+ team wants to support them t o generate a common goal, hope, creative thinking, 
and passion. Inspired by Brouwer and Brouwers (2017 ),2 we asked participants to imagine taking a ride on 
a hot air balloon that transports them to the year 2050, where something remarkable has happened with 
Nandi county’s food systems. Having heard about the se changes, a German documentary team wants to 
interview different entities to find out about what  has happened and what they can learn to address th e 
challenges facing Germany’s food systems. 
Participants were asked to choose roles from the Ge rman documentary team or the interviewees from 
Nandy county. All participants were asked to discus s which questions the documentary team should ask 
and how the interviewees should answer. Afterward, six of the participants acted out the interview. Be low 
is a summary of the interview content. 
Key achievements: 
 Nandi county is food-secure 
 Healthy food is available and malnutrition has decl ined 
 There are strong improvements in literacy 
 Forest cover has increased to more than 15 percent,  which has reduced the effects of climate 
change, led to more reliable rainfall, and supporte d agricultural production 
 Farmers’ productivity has improved (e.g., the minim um milk production per cow per day is 40 
liters) 
 Marketing and storage systems are efficient 
 Surplus food production is exported 
 Youth have returned to farming 
 Everybody owns the process 
Key enabling factors: 
 Actors working together to respond to community nee ds, climate change, and other changes in 
communities; each stakeholder plays a role based on  their expertise 
 Involvement of everyone through social inclusion in  food systems 
 Improved leadership, especially county government

The Theory of Change  
The remainder of the workshop was dedicated to disc ussing the following questions in groups: 
 Which actor would need to do what to move toward th e joint vision? 
 What could motivate, enable, or prompt relevant act ors to take these actions? 
 Who could motivate, induce, or enable the relevant actor? 
The complete documentation of the outcomes of this process is provided in the appendix to this report.  
Key aspects of the discussions are summarized below .

Open reflection on the process 
The last session was a reflection on possible follo w-up actions. The purpose of this exercise was to l et 
participants step back from the details that had be en discussed and detach from any confusing and 
contradicting signals and facts, some of which can be related to a participant’s identity. 
The session was guided by the image of a wise counc il, which is a group of women and men with great 
knowledge and experience. The members look at the i ssues with an open mind and heart, without any 
agenda and independent of their identity (such as s ex, age, education, or sector). 
Statements raised by participants in this process i ncluded: 
 I see a better Kenya 
 I see a vibrant community that is able to feed thei r children and take them to school 
 I feel change/transformation is possible by working  together 
 I feel inspired, energized; I see an inspired team 
 I see the importance of working together; a lot can  be achieved through collaboration 
 I see a lot of challenges and opportunities 
 I feel blessed to be part of a team that is going t o change the world 
 We are thankful for your time and insights; looking  forward to working and interacting with you 
more; it is good working with ILRI 
 
The meeting closed with a prayer.
