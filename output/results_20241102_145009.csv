While the primary objective is to examine social dynamics and decision-making power among farmers, the study is situated within the broader context of land use changes that have significant implications for environmental health and biodiversity in the Mekong Delta.\n\nThe transition to rice-shrimp farming can impact environmental factors such as water quality, salinity levels, soil health, and biodiversity due to changes in agricultural practices and resource use. By exploring how to manage these transitions effectively and promote cooperation among farmers, the research indirectly contributes to CGIAR's objectives related to environmental health and biodiversity conservation, specifically in promoting sustainable land use and resource management.\n\nTherefore, although environmental health and biodiversity are not the primary focus of the study, the research provides meaningful insights into these areas.

The research focuses on testing digital tools designed to assist farmers in adopting sustainable agricultural practices such as reduced fertilizer and pesticide use, implementation of the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) technique for water management, and integrated pest management. These practices are known to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation (climate mitigation) and enhance the resilience of small-scale producers to climate impacts (climate adaptation).
