While the review provided a comprehensive overview of various interventions across different settings and populations, the effectiveness of these interventions varied significantly, and many lacked rigorous evaluation designs. The review highlighted that interventions targeting adults were generally more effective than those aimed at children, and those incorporating multiple components were more impactful. However, the lack of comparability in outcomes and methodologies across studies complicated the interpretation of findings. The review also noted a significant underrepresentation of studies from low and middle-income countries, suggesting a gap in the global evidence base. Future research should focus on enhancing the robustness of intervention evaluations and exploring sustainability of behavior changes."
