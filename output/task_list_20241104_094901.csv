The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT has extensive experience in using seasonal climate forecasts to improve the management of annual crops (e.g., variety selection, planting time, etc.), but there is limited experience with perennial cropping systems such as cocoa. To this end, we aim to understand which management decisions can benefit from seasonal climate forecasts, which climate variables would require good forecasting skills, and how forecasts need to be translated and communicated to end- users. To achieve this goal, the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT is applying human-centered design (HCD), a creative and participatory approach to problem-solving that allows for a deep understanding of the people for whom we design and the environments in which they live. Stakeholders are considered co-designers in the process of creating solutions or tools, whether digital or non-digital.

Through a review and expert-elicitation process, we identify five engagement arenas to advance a governance agenda for aquaculture sustainability transformation: (1) setting sustainability transformation goals, (2) cross-sectoral linkages, (3) land–water–sea connectivity, (4) knowledge and innovation, and (5) value chains. We then outline the roles different actors and modes of governance can play in fostering sustainability transformations, and discuss action items for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to operationalize activities within their engagement arenas.

Concerted governance efforts can help move the sector beyond fragmented technical questions associated with intensification and expansion, social and environmental impacts, and toward system-based approaches that address interconnected sustainability issues. Through a review and expert-elicitation process, we identify five engagement arenas to advance a governance agenda for aquaculture sustainability transformation: (1) setting sustainability transformation goals, (2) cross-sectoral linkages, (3) land–water–sea connectivity, (4) knowledge and innovation, and (5) value chains. We then outline the roles different actors and modes of governance can play in fostering sustainability transformations, and discuss action items for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to operationalize activities within their engagement arenas.

The effective and efficient water resource conservation and management necessary to mitigate the crisis requires monitoring data, especially on water quality. This is recognized by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, particularly indicator 6.3.2., which requires all UN member states to measure and report the ‘proportion of water bodies with good ambient water quality’. However, gathering sufficient data on water quality is reliant on data collection at spatial and temporal scales that are generally outside the capacity of institutions using conventional methods. Digital technologies, such as wireless sensor networks and remote sensing, have come to the fore as promising avenues to increase the scope of data collection and reporting. Citizen science (which goes by many names, e.g., participatory science or community-based monitoring) has also been earmarked as a powerful mechanism to improve monitoring. However, both avenues have drawbacks and limitations. The synergy between the strengths of modern technologies and citizen science presents an opportunity to use the best features of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the other. This paper briefly synthesizes recent research illustrating how smartphones, sometimes in conjunction with other sensors, present a nexus point method for citizen scientists to engage with and use sophisticated modern technology for water quality monitoring. This paper also presents a brief, non-exhaustive research synthesis of some examples of current technological upgrades or innovations regarding smartphones in citizen science water quality monitoring in developing countries and how these can assist in objective, comprehensive, and improved data collection, management and reporting. While digital innovations are being rapidly developed worldwide, there remains a paucity of scientific and socioeconomic validation of their suitability and usefulness within citizen science. This perhaps contributes to the fact that the uptake and upscaling of smartphone-assisted citizen science continues to underperform compared to its potential within water resource management and SDG reporting. Ultimately, we recommend that more rigorous scientific research efforts be dedicated to exploring the suitability of digital innovations in citizen science in the context of developing countries and SDG reporting.

of DT in the context of basin scale water management, with a particular focus on developing 
countries. The review begins with an examination of the background of DT and then delves into 
successful applications of DT particularly in developing nations. It also explores the potential of 
integrating Virtual Reality (VR) technologies as a part of DT, emphasizing the importance of 
stakeholder needs assessment for effective deployment. The review highlights the significance of 
data infrastructure architecture and data governance in the context of Digital Twins. The review 
concentrates on the published literature and the application of Digital Twins to river basins, 
emphasizing their role in decision -making at this level and outlining various use cases for water 
management.  Furthermore,  it assesses  the expected  impact  of DT through  the lens of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The review concludes by exploring the integration of Artificial 
Intelligence  (AI) in the  context of  DT for river basins. Overall, this review  summarizes the  potential 
benefits and challenges of implementing DT for water management in developing countries.  
 
 
1. Background  
Natural  systems are  inherently  complex  webs  of interconnected 
components that encompass environment, ecosystems, and 
numerous earth system processes operating at scales. Human 
activities and their iterations with these systems make them 
more complex leading to several intended and unintended 
consequences with dynamic feedback loops. While these 
complexities have always existed, these have increased due to 
the recent  technological  explosion  (Sargut  and McGrath,  2011). 
As averred by Sargut and McGrath (2011), the complexity has 
gone from something found in large confined systems, such as 
factories  and cities, to remote environments  such as entire river 
basins. The non -linear effects and dynamic feedback loops  from the natural systems and their human interactions are 
making it harder to predict what will happen because they 
interact  in unexpected ways  and are difficult  to manage.  This is 
especially true where reliable data are not easily accessible.  
River basins are complex natural systems where human 
activities imparted profound influence on water, land, 
ecosystems, and climate patterns. There is no doubt that the 
management of the water resources of a basin is a complex 
issue due to the inherent interplay  of the changing environment 
(Bernhardt et al., 2006; Cosgrove and Loucks, 2015; Leb et  al., 
2018; Young and Harshadeep, 2020). River basin ecosystems 
provide  water  resources  for agriculture,  livestock,  and fisheries, 
industry and for domestic use, sustaining the livelihoods of

Figure  1 A simple  representation  of Digital  Twin  (Jones  et al., 2020)  
 
millions  of people  in the region.  Nonetheless,  these  river  basin 
ecosystems are also subject to hydroclimatic extremes, land 
degradation, poor water quality, urbanization and population 
growth. These environmental shifts not only pose a threat to 
the rich biodiversity in river basins but also weaken the 
resilience of local communities to climate change (Fazey et  
al., 2021; Carmen et al, 2022).  
To effectively manage these complex natural systems 
impacted by human activities, there is a need to leverage 
technological advancements such as high -performance 
computing,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  and real-time database 
management  systems.  The DT concept  is an advanced  version 
of traditional Decision Support Systems (DSS) used to 
manage water resources and environmental processes in river 
basin ecosystems. By utilizing new generation sensors, big 
data, cloud processing and AI, a digital representation of the 
river basin is created, providing a dynamic framework that 
offers comprehensive information for effective management.  
A DT is a rapidly emerging concept that digitally depicts an 
object, a process, or a system (Grieves, 2014; Ademenko et  
al., 2020 and references therein). Grieves and Vickers (2004) 
pioneered the work of DT and presented a DT framework as 
comprising three components, a physical object, a digital 
representation of that object, and the bi -directional data 
connections that feed data from the physical to the digital 
representation, and information and processes from  the digital 
representation  to the physical  (Figure  1). DT has the capability 
of accelerating innovation (e.g., improved modelling of  
system changes or optimized business supply chains) if 
coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT) or AI (Jones et al., 
2020).  
A review  of DT literature by  Jones  et al. (2020)  demonstrated 
increased interest in recent years across both academia and 
industry as seen in the growth in the number of related 
publications,  processes,  concepts,  and envisaged  benefits.  In a 
bid to determine if DT could be used in the Nature -based 
Solutions (NbS) for stormwater and transboundary water  security projects, the existing conceptual challenges and the 
DT definition as a framework were examined (Brasil et al., 
2022). They identified how the mathematical modelling 
reported in the literature could improve the DT development, 
and evaluated the potential benefits associated with the 
application of DT in NbS. Noting the sparse presence of DT 
applications in water resource management and in particular 
river basin management, the present review aims to a)  
establish the role of AI techniques such as machine learning, 
deep learning, and data analytics in enhancing the predictive 
and decision -making capabilities of digital twins, b) compile 
information about existing DT applications in developing 
countries,  c) assess  the DT infrastructure,  architecture  and data 
governance frameworks, and d) characterize the relevant DT 
use cases for river basin management. This review contributes 
towards developing a robust conceptual framework for an 
operational Limpopo River Basin DT.  
2. Literature  Review  
The era of digital technologies capable of transforming the 
livelihoods of developing country populace is now more 
obvious. Yet the inherent core pillars including the digital 
infrastructure, human capital and enabling environment, 
continue to act as impediments to these countries’ massive 
digital ecosystem potential that is hugely needed for socio - 
economic equitable growth (Union, 2020). Juxtaposing the 
role that water sensitive sectors  play in support  of advancing 
economic  growth,  socio - and gender  equity  and creating  jobs 
under changing climate, this underscores the value of  digital 
innovation ecosystem in the context of water resource 
management (Shilin et al., 2021; Józefowicz et al., 2023).

Figure 3 Trends of research themes. Upper -right quadrant are the motor themes (hot topics); themes appearing in the  upper -left quadrant are considered very spe - 
cialized  topics -niche  themes;  the lower  right  are termed basic  themes;  emerging  or declining  themes  are generally  weakly  developed,  have  low density,  low central - 
ity and are either emerging or disappearing.  
 
Fortunately,  our world  is abuzz  with disruptive  technologies 
that are transforming  the way  we respond to the  present  and 
future challenges. The digital transformation strategy for 
Africa (2020 -2030), avers that;  
“Africa presents a sea of economic opportunities in 
virtually every sector, and the continent’s youthful 
population structure is an enormous opportunity in 
this digital  era and hence  the need  for Africa  to make 
digitally  enabled  socio -economic  development  a high 
priority.”  
Against  the backdrop  of the digital  transformation  strategy  for 
Africa, there is need to ameliorate the unique challenges of 
adoption of digital technologies across Africa. There is no 
doubt that the new technologies and approaches for 
digitalizing and smartening water systems through Big Data, 
algorithm  development  and Artificial  Intelligence  (using  Deep  & Machine Learning) are increasingly being recognized 
globally. While Digital Agriculture & Digital Water 
Innovations (hereafter DA -DW-I) have a global footprint, 
arguments  for their impact  and developmental  implications  are 
generally subtle in the global South (e.g., Amankwa et al., 
2021).

Figure  4 Content  analysis  of Digital  Twin  scholarship  in Africa  (Source:  Authors)  
 
Peer-reviewed published literature on DT and river basin 
management in scientific databases (e.g., Scopus and Web of 
Science (WoS)), illustrates that the global DT scholarship on 
river basin management is generally a nascent research  
agenda. This evidence is illustrated by more than 12 years of 
publications given in Figure 2, wherein the majority of the 
scientific  articles  focusing  on DT only emerge  in the past three 
years. There were 41 peer -reviewed scientific publications on  
 
Table  2 Nature  of country  collaboration  on the DT publications  in Africa  DT with river basin references. In terms of the research 
interests across countries, the review analysis suggests that 
China  and South  African  researchers  are at the forefront,  albeit 
surprisingly lacking collaboration as most publications focus 
on single country (Table 1). In terms of emerging themes in  
the DT research domain, the review established that there are 
subtle hot topics (upper right), very specialized (upper left) as 
well as basic (lower right) and emerging (lower left) research 
themes as depicted in  Figure 3. The evolution of the research 
themes from a global perspective is expected to change as the 
direction of DT scholarship changes in future.  
In reviewing published literature on DT in Africa, few key 
words were used i.e., “Digital Twin” and “Africa” and the 
search kept to “within” abstracts only.  Only nineteen articles 
(17 from Scopus and 2 from WoS) were extracted that had 
some  content  on DT. A quick  analysis  of the trends,  and social

Figure  5 A computer -generated  digital  environment  of the Hatfield  Digital  Twin  City,  Pretoria,  South  Africa  (Source:  https:// www.up.ac.za/news/post_3008856 -

networks of the DT scholarship illustrated that the scientific 
discourse only emerged in databases considered from 2018 
(only one article) with most articles published in 2023 (7 
seven  articles).  Seven  peer reviewed  scientific  publications  on 
DT (where river basin management is also mentioned) were 
published between 2020 and 2022. The composition of the 
article types illustrated that most of the DT research has 
mostly  appeared  in scientific  conferences,  while  five, two, and 
four appeared in Journals, Book Chapters and Reviews 
respectively.  The nature of publication collaborations by 
country, Table 2, illustrates that DT scholars from South 
Africa and the United Kingdom exhibit both single and 
multiple country publications while France, Germany and 
Morocco have single country publications. To understand the 
research direction or applications of DT in Africa, Figure 4 
shows the content analysis of abstracts of the 17 reviewed 
articles. Though research on DT in the African continent is 
still at it’s infancy, content analysis results of the reviewed 
articles given in Figure 4 bring forth three main research 
directions,  i.e., methodology, applications  and use. It however 
important to note that these results are not exhaustive at this 
stage.  
Smart City  and Digital Twin City  are new novel methods of 
city management  being  implemented  worldwide,  in response 
to the expansion  of cities  and megacities  in the current  era of technology  disruption,  rapid  urbanization  and climate  change. 
For instance, in 2021, the University of Pretoria announced 
the creation of Hatfield Digital Twin City, a novel initiative  
that aims to boost service delivery with the help of smart 
technology (Figure 5).  
A literature  search  of smart  city applications  of DT in  the 
African continent resulted to only the following notable 
publications:  
a) Nigerian  Electricity  Supply  Industry  (NESI): Aliyu et  al. 
(2021)  analyzed  the NESI  framework  and concluded  that 
the system uses a novel framework that is premised on a 
SoS and digital twins.  
b) Broekman  and Steyn  (2022)  reported  on Digital  Twinning 
of Lap -based Marathon Infrastructure: the digitization of 
the marathon route using Real -Time Kinematic Global 
Navigation Satellite Systems (RTK GNSS) and high - 
density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensing 
capabilities to allow for the detailed geometry 
measurements and environmental analysis before and  
after such events. They concluded that the intersection of 
engineering and sports disciplines and technology 
illustrates the potential realization of smart cities and 
recreation in an evolutionary society.

South Africa.  
3. Digital  Twins  and Virtual  Reality  
In the rapidly advancing technological era we inhabit,  it is 
advantageous to critically evaluate the functionalities and 
applicability  of immersive and interactive digital technologies 
such as Virtual  Reality  (VR)  to sectors  which  impact  our well- 
being and quality of life in sectors such as agriculture and 
water management. Furthermore, it is important to explore 
how these  emergent  technologies  like VR can shape  and guide  decision making in water resources management, aid in risk 
management  and accelerate  technology  usage.  This will result 
in the generation of innovative technology -based solutions 
toward solving river basin challenges to ameliorate humanity 
and the sustainability of food and water resources.  
Gigante (1993) defines VR as being “characterized by the 
illusion of participation in a synthetic environment than 
external  observation  of such an environment.  It relies  on three - 
dimensional, stereoscopic, head -tracked displays, hand/body 
tracking, and binaural sound”. Additionally, VR may be 
delineated as an immersive, multisensory experience ( Holuša, 
et al., 2023; Azarby, & Rice, 2022). It is also referred to as 
providing virtual environments, virtual worlds, or 
microworlds. A journal titled, Development of a Digital Twin 
for smart farming: Irrigation management system for water

 saving  asserts  that the “digital  twin applied  to agriculture  is in 
its early stages of development”. It further defines a digital 
twin as an entity where “data flows automatically and in both 
directions between a physical object and a virtual  
object” (Alves, Maia & Lima, 2023). It is imperative to note 
that the adoption of these technologies is in an experimental 
phase and the consolidation of two or more technologies such 
as DT and VR is an even more recently employed practice. A 
literature  review  on the linkages  between  VR and DT revealed 
an interesting pattern of these two concepts. The concepts of 
VR and DT seems to have appeared only in the last two 
decades  (based  on the Scopus  and WoS  databases).  According 
to the two databases, 857 articles (comprising of largely 
journal articles -50%; and conference papers -25%). Most of  
the scholarship only emerged post -2018. In terms of the 
linkages between DT, VR and Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Figure  6 illustrates  detailed  interconnections  between  the three 
concepts and other antecedent terminologies. As shown in 
Figure 6, there are intrinsic interlinkages between these three 
concepts  and other  concepts  such as data analytics,  augmented 
reality, machine learning – all related to advanced 
computational techniques.  
There are a host of possibilities for the application of 
technologies such as DT and VR to actively address water 
management concerns specific to river basins in developing 
African  countries.  The unique  characteristics  DT and VR offer 
respectively  and when  combined provide  useful  real-time data 
to allow  for the continuous monitoring of river basins. Firstly, 
DT and VR offer accessible realistic digital visualizations 
which enable integrated river basin modelling. While DT 
establishes a real -time virtual representation of the river basin 
presenting water flow, dam operations, pollution sources and 
other environmental elements, VR allows for the visual 
navigation of the DT model and permits interactivity where 
users may directly impact the virtual environment they are 
visiting using their senses including sight, touch, smell and 
hearing to observe the real -time condition of river basins.  
River basins play a pivotal role in supplying fresh water and 
regulating water flow and quality. A DT and VR 
collaboratively  may be used to monitor the physical condition 
of the river basins. The DT will provide the data analytics 
required while VR will allow scientists and engineers to 
conduct virtual inspections and assessments eliminating the 
need for them to be physically present. Lastly, in the case of 
water  crises  such as droughts  or floods  the data extracted  from  the DT can  be analysed  to predict  heavy  rainfalls  that may 
cause  floods  or increased  evapotranspiration  and the over- 
extraction of ground water that may cause droughts.  
Concurrently,  VR can be employed  to pre-visualize  droughts 
and floods  before  they occur  to implement  prevention  tactics 
or mitigate the impact if inevitable.  
An exemplary  case study where DT and VR has been  utilized 
cooperatively  to combat  agricultural  related  challenges  can be 
seen through AgroIT, a company that provides technological 
solutions for the agricultural sector, particularly focusing on 
precision agriculture. AgroIT's platform uses Digital Twin 
technology to create a virtual representation of farmlands, 
incorporating data like soil conditions, weather, and crop 
health. On the VR front, they have explored its use for 
visualizing these digital farms. This combination allows 
farmers to virtually 'walk' through their fields, visualize 
potential problem areas, and make informed decisions about 
irrigation, fertilization and other operations1. 
The ambitions  of DT and VR for environmental  application in 
developing countries based on its previous uses are to aid in 
water resource management systems. This one day may be as 
advanced as integrated user interfaces. Virtual reality is also 
known as an ‘empathy machine’ because of its unique ability 
to immerse users in emotionally charged perspectives, 
experiences, and environments which may prompt positive 
actions  and behaviors  in real life. Through  the advancement  of 
brain -computer interfaces users might control DT simulations 
or navigate VR environments using their thoughts. This could 
lead to more intuitive user experiences and might even allow 
for emotion -driven simulations, where users can ""feel"" the 
impacts of different river management decisions. DT and VR 
technologies strategically locate themselves at the heart of 
digital innovation as solution -based methods that directly 
address the need for visual representations to accurately 
measure the state of water, food and land conditions within 
various  regions  susceptible to food and water wastage, natural 
disasters and shortages. Researchers and scientists look 
forward to the progression of these technologies and the 
problems they will solve in the water management sector. A 
consideration of the manner we orient and define DT and VR 
as their operations evolve and their capacity expands will be 
essential to the integration and assimilation of these ever - 
changing digital innovations.

4. Stakeholder  Needs  Assessment  
DT models are anchored on data from various life cycle 
phases that ought to be collected and analyzed to deliver 
services to a myriad of stakeholders. The utility of the DT 
services is dependent on the level of alignment with 
stakeholder needs. In order ensure uptake of the DT services, 
there  is need  to undertake  stakeholder  engagement  through  the 
development phases of the DT design and implementation.  
Stakeholders are defined as all groups and individuals who 
influence the aims of an organization, project or product and 
vice versa (Freeman and McVea, 2005). As part of  
stakeholder analysis, the stakeholders, their interests and their 
characteristics are identified. This is followed by clustering 
and prioritization  of the stakeholders.  After  analysis,  a strategy 
and recommended actions can be defined (Ramirez, 1999).  
From the DT design and implementation perspective, a 
stakeholder typology reported in Mitchael et al., (1997) as 
well as stakeholder identification based on the interest - 
influence matrix  reported in  e.g., Janssens  de Bisthoven  et al., 
(2022) should be considered. All the DT use cases relevant to 
river -based  management  presented  in Section  7.2, undertook  a 
well-designed iterative stakeholder engagement process  
during the design and implementation of the DT.  
5. 3D Representation  of a River  Basin  Digital 
Twin  
The emergence  of digital  twin technology  has revolutionized 
several fields,  from  manufacturing  to urban  planning  (Tao  et 
al., 2018).  The application  of this innovative  concept  to river basin management using the 3D Representation provides a 
compelling overview of the potential benefits and challenges 
faced.  A river  basin,  being  a complex  system  with a myriad of 
interrelated components such as water flow, sediment 
transport, vegetation, and human interventions, necessitates a 
robust modeling approach. The three -dimensional 
representation in the mentioned work provides a vivid and 
detailed visualization of these elements, making it an 
invaluable tool for stakeholders.  
6. Data  Infrastructure  Architecture  for a Digital 
Twin  
The envisioned  DT architecture  is often  characterized  by two 
main  typologies  - monitoring  and predictive  DT as  described 
in Figure 7. The monitoring typology  represents the past and 
present dynamics of the physical and social -economic 
properties and interactions with the hydroclimatic 
environment, where a virtual representation is created using 
this data. From the perspective of predictive typology, 
predictive models will use past and present data to create a 
plausible future rendition of the present state of the 
environment.  
As reported  in Brasil  et al. (2022)  and Dhulipala  (2021),  a DT 
conceptual framework comprises the components briefly 
described below (also see Figure 8):  
a) Data  source  layer:  to accurately  represent  the LRB  in a 
digital space, various data sets will be required. These 
data sets ought to represent not only the physical

Figure  8 The physical  environment,  data storage,  digital  environment  and applications  services  of the Digital  Twin  (Adapted  from  Brasil  et al., 2022)  
 
environment but also the biological and chemical 
conditions of the basin. Some of the data sources may 
include, remotely sensed data -from satellites and/or 
drones, hydrological process model data, ground 
observations (e.g., water quality/proxy measurements, 
weather  data,  mobile  app captured  data sets),  and thirty 
party datasets which are often analysis ready (e.g., 
climatic data from  the Digital Earth Africa platform  or 
non-climatic datasets  from  the National Department of 
Statistics).  
b) Data processing layer: One of the key functions of this 
layer is to pre -process and format the various data sets to 
ensure inter -operability among the various strands of the 
data. In addition, this layer executes a set of data 
modelling functions including hydrological process 
modelling, climate data downscaling and bias correction, 
satellite image classing to derive various product 
including  hydroclimatic  extremes  and irrigated  area maps.  
c) Data visualization and analytic layer: Based on the 
outputs  in b), this layer  comprises  GIS-enabled  analytic  tools embedded with dashboards to display various user 
selected features. Some of the key  outputs from  this layer 
would be the early warning messages that denote 
hydroclimatic  extremes,  risk areas  and the general  state of 
the river basin.  
d) Advisory and dissemination layer: this layer is a rule 
engine  embedded  decision  support  rule system  that helps 
provide intelligent management options suited for the 
present  and future  physical  state of the river  basin.  These 
decisions are often disseminated using channels such as 
SMS/USSD, web and mobile applications, and even 
tower broadcasts once the system is implemented.  
7. Digital  Twin Data  Governance Framework  
At the heart of the DT, is the data collection, curation, 
management, analysis as well as output of data (Figure 8). 
Since  DT information  can be viewed  as the high-end utility  of 
all the data sets, a strong  data foundation  is necessary.  To this 
end, a robust data foundation is underpinned by a strong data 
governance2 and data management3 strategy (see Plotkin,  
 
 
 
2 Data  governance  is the formal  oversight,  execution  and enforcement  of authority  over the management  of data. 
3 Data  management  is the effective  management  of data to achieve  goals  i.e. it ensures  that an organization  gets value  out of its data while  minimizing  operating  risk.

Figure  9 Data  domains  (Source:  Khatri  and Brown,  2010)  
 
2020;  Conarado,  2014).  In the context  of DT, the four decision 
domains of data governance reported in Khatri and Brown, 
(2010) are appropriate. Thus, a data governance framework 
could comprise; a) data principles (at the top) which are 
intended to establish the direction for all other decision 
domains, and set the boundary requirements for uses of data 
assets, thereby addressing standards for data quality; b) the 
data quality then determines how data are interpreted 
(metadata) as well as accessed (data access) by users; and c) 
the data life -cycle decision which defines the production, 
retention and retirement of data assets (Alhassan et al., 2016).  
The aim of the DT for river basin management could be seen 
as the exhaustive capture of all physical environment 
parameters which are often intrinsically linked to aspects of 
people's  lives, and intellectual property. Determining how  this 
information is shared between organizations and individuals 
will naturally require some data sharing policy (Jones et al., 
2020).  This even  more  so when  referring  to both physical  and 
virtual  entities - to what  extent  does DT data ownership  go? As 
a result, the question  of ownership encompasses who accesses 
the data and for what purpose. As reported in Jones et. al., 
(2020), there are social and cultural implications associated 
with the large -scale collection, storage, and sharing of data 
through the Digital Twin that need to be fully addressed 
through a data governance framework.  
While co -designed data governance framework could 
accelerate  access  and use of data and services  of the DT, the 
following key challenges ought to be overcome;  a) Cataloguing  for all the available  data collected  by 
separate  and distinct  scientists  and/or  institutions,  
b) Understanding  the data in the proper  context  and the need 
to link similar data sets together,  
c) Akin to many sectors such as financial services, retail, 
and healthcare companies, there may be a lack of 
resources  (e.g.,  data stewards)  to curate  and maintain  the 
quality of the data.  
 
8. Digital  Twin  for River  Basins Applications  
8.1. Digital  Twin  for decision  making  at the river  basin - 
level 
The utility  of DT applications  at basin  level  lies in the inherent 
adaptive capability wherein the near -real time river basin 
processes will be captured. As a result, any reactive measures 
(including  plausible  futures)  lead to improved  efficiency  of the 
basin operations, optimized uncertainty measures, early 
warning  detection  and generally  good  emergency  management 
(Pal et al., 2023). These salient features are supported by 
embedding AI algorithms with the DT architecture. The AI  
has the capability of providing additional insights beyond  
what the sensors provide t","9445"

The effective and efficient water resource conservation and management necessary to mitigate the crisis requires monitoring data, especially on water quality. This is recognized by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, particularly indicator 6.3.2., which requires all UN member states to measure and report the ‘proportion of water bodies with good ambient water quality’. However, gathering sufficient data on water quality is reliant on data collection at spatial and temporal scales that are generally outside the capacity of institutions using conventional methods. Digital technologies, such as wireless sensor networks and remote sensing, have come to the fore as promising avenues to increase the scope of data collection and reporting. Citizen science (which goes by many names, e.g., participatory science or community-based monitoring) has also been earmarked as a powerful mechanism to improve monitoring. However, both avenues have drawbacks and limitations. The synergy between the strengths of modern technologies and citizen science presents an opportunity to use the best features of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the other. This paper briefly synthesizes recent research illustrating how smartphones, sometimes in conjunction with other sensors, present a nexus point method for citizen scientists to engage with and use sophisticated modern technology for water quality monitoring. This paper also presents a brief, non-exhaustive research synthesis of some examples of current technological upgrades or innovations regarding smartphones in citizen science water quality monitoring in developing countries and how these can assist in objective, comprehensive, and improved data collection, management and reporting. While digital innovations are being rapidly developed worldwide, there remains a paucity of scientific and socioeconomic validation of their suitability and usefulness within citizen science. This perhaps contributes to the fact that the uptake and upscaling of smartphone-assisted citizen science continues to underperform compared to its potential within water resource management and SDG reporting. Ultimately, we recommend that more rigorous scientific research efforts be dedicated to exploring the suitability of digital innovations in citizen science in the context of developing countries and SDG reporting.

A Digital Twin (DT) is a digital representation of reality.  This report explores the implementation  
of DT in the context of basin scale water management, with a particular focus on developing 
countries. The review begins with an examination of the background of DT and then delves into 
successful applications of DT particularly in developing nations. It also explores the potential of 
integrating Virtual Reality (VR) technologies as a part of DT, emphasizing the importance of 
stakeholder needs assessment for effective deployment. The review highlights the significance of 
data infrastructure architecture and data governance in the context of Digital Twins. The review 
concentrates on the published literature and the application of Digital Twins to river basins, 
emphasizing their role in decision -making at this level and outlining various use cases for water 
management.  Furthermore,  it assesses  the expected  impact  of DT through  the lens of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The review concludes by exploring the integration of Artificial 
Intelligence  (AI) in the  context of  DT for river basins. Overall, this review  summarizes the  potential 
benefits and challenges of implementing DT for water management in developing countries.  
 
 
1. Background  
Natural  systems are  inherently  complex  webs  of interconnected 
components that encompass environment, ecosystems, and 
numerous earth system processes operating at scales. Human 
activities and their iterations with these systems make them 
more complex leading to several intended and unintended 
consequences with dynamic feedback loops. While these 
complexities have always existed, these have increased due to 
the recent  technological  explosion  (Sargut  and McGrath,  2011). 
As averred by Sargut and McGrath (2011), the complexity has 
gone from something found in large confined systems, such as 
factories  and cities, to remote environments  such as entire river 
basins. The non -linear effects and dynamic feedback loops  from the natural systems and their human interactions are 
making it harder to predict what will happen because they 
interact  in unexpected ways  and are difficult  to manage.  This is 
especially true where reliable data are not easily accessible.  
River basins are complex natural systems where human 
activities imparted profound influence on water, land, 
ecosystems, and climate patterns. There is no doubt that the 
management of the water resources of a basin is a complex 
issue due to the inherent interplay  of the changing environment 
(Bernhardt et al., 2006; Cosgrove and Loucks, 2015; Leb et  al., 
2018; Young and Harshadeep, 2020). River basin ecosystems 
provide  water  resources  for agriculture,  livestock,  and fisheries, 
industry and for domestic use, sustaining the livelihoods of

Figure  1 A simple  representation  of Digital  Twin  (Jones  et al., 2020)  
 
millions  of people  in the region.  Nonetheless,  these  river  basin 
ecosystems are also subject to hydroclimatic extremes, land 
degradation, poor water quality, urbanization and population 
growth. These environmental shifts not only pose a threat to 
the rich biodiversity in river basins but also weaken the 
resilience of local communities to climate change (Fazey et  
al., 2021; Carmen et al, 2022).  
To effectively manage these complex natural systems 
impacted by human activities, there is a need to leverage 
technological advancements such as high -performance 
computing,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  and real-time database 
management  systems.  The DT concept  is an advanced  version 
of traditional Decision Support Systems (DSS) used to 
manage water resources and environmental processes in river 
basin ecosystems. By utilizing new generation sensors, big 
data, cloud processing and AI, a digital representation of the 
river basin is created, providing a dynamic framework that 
offers comprehensive information for effective management.  
A DT is a rapidly emerging concept that digitally depicts an 
object, a process, or a system (Grieves, 2014; Ademenko et  
al., 2020 and references therein). Grieves and Vickers (2004) 
pioneered the work of DT and presented a DT framework as 
comprising three components, a physical object, a digital 
representation of that object, and the bi -directional data 
connections that feed data from the physical to the digital 
representation, and information and processes from  the digital 
representation  to the physical  (Figure  1). DT has the capability 
of accelerating innovation (e.g., improved modelling of  
system changes or optimized business supply chains) if 
coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT) or AI (Jones et al., 
2020).  
A review  of DT literature by  Jones  et al. (2020)  demonstrated 
increased interest in recent years across both academia and 
industry as seen in the growth in the number of related 
publications,  processes,  concepts,  and envisaged  benefits.  In a 
bid to determine if DT could be used in the Nature -based 
Solutions (NbS) for stormwater and transboundary water  security projects, the existing conceptual challenges and the 
DT definition as a framework were examined (Brasil et al., 
2022). They identified how the mathematical modelling 
reported in the literature could improve the DT development, 
and evaluated the potential benefits associated with the 
application of DT in NbS. Noting the sparse presence of DT 
applications in water resource management and in particular 
river basin management, the present review aims to a)  
establish the role of AI techniques such as machine learning, 
deep learning, and data analytics in enhancing the predictive 
and decision -making capabilities of digital twins, b) compile 
information about existing DT applications in developing 
countries,  c) assess  the DT infrastructure,  architecture  and data 
governance frameworks, and d) characterize the relevant DT 
use cases for river basin management. This review contributes 
towards developing a robust conceptual framework for an 
operational Limpopo River Basin DT.  
2. Literature  Review  
The era of digital technologies capable of transforming the 
livelihoods of developing country populace is now more 
obvious. Yet the inherent core pillars including the digital 
infrastructure, human capital and enabling environment, 
continue to act as impediments to these countries’ massive 
digital ecosystem potential that is hugely needed for socio - 
economic equitable growth (Union, 2020). Juxtaposing the 
role that water sensitive sectors  play in support  of advancing 
economic  growth,  socio - and gender  equity  and creating  jobs 
under changing climate, this underscores the value of  digital 
innovation ecosystem in the context of water resource 
management (Shilin et al., 2021; Józefowicz et al., 2023).

Figure 3 Trends of research themes. Upper -right quadrant are the motor themes (hot topics); themes appearing in the  upper -left quadrant are considered very spe - 
cialized  topics -niche  themes;  the lower  right  are termed basic  themes;  emerging  or declining  themes  are generally  weakly  developed,  have  low density,  low central - 
ity and are either emerging or disappearing.  
 
Fortunately,  our world  is abuzz  with disruptive  technologies 
that are transforming  the way  we respond to the  present  and 
future challenges. The digital transformation strategy for 
Africa (2020 -2030), avers that;  
“Africa presents a sea of economic opportunities in 
virtually every sector, and the continent’s youthful 
population structure is an enormous opportunity in 
this digital  era and hence  the need  for Africa  to make 
digitally  enabled  socio -economic  development  a high 
priority.”  
Against  the backdrop  of the digital  transformation  strategy  for 
Africa, there is need to ameliorate the unique challenges of 
adoption of digital technologies across Africa. There is no 
doubt that the new technologies and approaches for 
digitalizing and smartening water systems through Big Data, 
algorithm  development  and Artificial  Intelligence  (using  Deep  & Machine Learning) are increasingly being recognized 
globally. While Digital Agriculture & Digital Water 
Innovations (hereafter DA -DW-I) have a global footprint, 
arguments  for their impact  and developmental  implications  are 
generally subtle in the global South (e.g., Amankwa et al., 
2021).

Figure  4 Content  analysis  of Digital  Twin  scholarship  in Africa  (Source:  Authors)  
 
Peer-reviewed published literature on DT and river basin 
management in scientific databases (e.g., Scopus and Web of 
Science (WoS)), illustrates that the global DT scholarship on 
river basin management is generally a nascent research  
agenda. This evidence is illustrated by more than 12 years of 
publications given in Figure 2, wherein the majority of the 
scientific  articles  focusing  on DT only emerge  in the past three 
years. There were 41 peer -reviewed scientific publications on  
 
Table  2 Nature  of country  collaboration  on the DT publications  in Africa  DT with river basin references. In terms of the research 
interests across countries, the review analysis suggests that 
China  and South  African  researchers  are at the forefront,  albeit 
surprisingly lacking collaboration as most publications focus 
on single country (Table 1). In terms of emerging themes in  
the DT research domain, the review established that there are 
subtle hot topics (upper right), very specialized (upper left) as 
well as basic (lower right) and emerging (lower left) research 
themes as depicted in  Figure 3. The evolution of the research 
themes from a global perspective is expected to change as the 
direction of DT scholarship changes in future.  
In reviewing published literature on DT in Africa, few key 
words were used i.e., “Digital Twin” and “Africa” and the 
search kept to “within” abstracts only.  Only nineteen articles 
(17 from Scopus and 2 from WoS) were extracted that had 
some  content  on DT. A quick  analysis  of the trends,  and social

networks of the DT scholarship illustrated that the scientific 
discourse only emerged in databases considered from 2018 
(only one article) with most articles published in 2023 (7 
seven  articles).  Seven  peer reviewed  scientific  publications  on 
DT (where river basin management is also mentioned) were 
published between 2020 and 2022. The composition of the 
article types illustrated that most of the DT research has 
mostly  appeared  in scientific  conferences,  while  five, two, and 
four appeared in Journals, Book Chapters and Reviews 
respectively.  The nature of publication collaborations by 
country, Table 2, illustrates that DT scholars from South 
Africa and the United Kingdom exhibit both single and 
multiple country publications while France, Germany and 
Morocco have single country publications. To understand the 
research direction or applications of DT in Africa, Figure 4 
shows the content analysis of abstracts of the 17 reviewed 
articles. Though research on DT in the African continent is 
still at it’s infancy, content analysis results of the reviewed 
articles given in Figure 4 bring forth three main research 
directions,  i.e., methodology, applications  and use. It however 
important to note that these results are not exhaustive at this 
stage.  
Smart City  and Digital Twin City  are new novel methods of 
city management  being  implemented  worldwide,  in response 
to the expansion  of cities  and megacities  in the current  era of technology  disruption,  rapid  urbanization  and climate  change. 
For instance, in 2021, the University of Pretoria announced 
the creation of Hatfield Digital Twin City, a novel initiative  
that aims to boost service delivery with the help of smart 
technology (Figure 5).  
A literature  search  of smart  city applications  of DT in  the 
African continent resulted to only the following notable 
publications:  
a) Nigerian  Electricity  Supply  Industry  (NESI): Aliyu et  al. 
(2021)  analyzed  the NESI  framework  and concluded  that 
the system uses a novel framework that is premised on a 
SoS and digital twins.  
b) Broekman  and Steyn  (2022)  reported  on Digital  Twinning 
of Lap -based Marathon Infrastructure: the digitization of 
the marathon route using Real -Time Kinematic Global 
Navigation Satellite Systems (RTK GNSS) and high - 
density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensing 
capabilities to allow for the detailed geometry 
measurements and environmental analysis before and  
after such events. They concluded that the intersection of 
engineering and sports disciplines and technology 
illustrates the potential realization of smart cities and 
recreation in an evolutionary society.

3. Digital  Twins  and Virtual  Reality  
In the rapidly advancing technological era we inhabit,  it is 
advantageous to critically evaluate the functionalities and 
applicability  of immersive and interactive digital technologies 
such as Virtual  Reality  (VR)  to sectors  which  impact  our well- 
being and quality of life in sectors such as agriculture and 
water management. Furthermore, it is important to explore 
how these  emergent  technologies  like VR can shape  and guide  decision making in water resources management, aid in risk 
management  and accelerate  technology  usage.  This will result 
in the generation of innovative technology -based solutions 
toward solving river basin challenges to ameliorate humanity 
and the sustainability of food and water resources.  
Gigante (1993) defines VR as being “characterized by the 
illusion of participation in a synthetic environment than 
external  observation  of such an environment.  It relies  on three - 
dimensional, stereoscopic, head -tracked displays, hand/body 
tracking, and binaural sound”. Additionally, VR may be 
delineated as an immersive, multisensory experience ( Holuša, 
et al., 2023; Azarby, & Rice, 2022). It is also referred to as 
providing virtual environments, virtual worlds, or 
microworlds. A journal titled, Development of a Digital Twin 
for smart farming: Irrigation management system for water

 saving  asserts  that the “digital  twin applied  to agriculture  is in 
its early stages of development”. It further defines a digital 
twin as an entity where “data flows automatically and in both 
directions between a physical object and a virtual  
object” (Alves, Maia & Lima, 2023). It is imperative to note 
that the adoption of these technologies is in an experimental 
phase and the consolidation of two or more technologies such 
as DT and VR is an even more recently employed practice. A 
literature  review  on the linkages  between  VR and DT revealed 
an interesting pattern of these two concepts. The concepts of 
VR and DT seems to have appeared only in the last two 
decades  (based  on the Scopus  and WoS  databases).  According 
to the two databases, 857 articles (comprising of largely 
journal articles -50%; and conference papers -25%). Most of  
the scholarship only emerged post -2018. In terms of the 
linkages between DT, VR and Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Figure  6 illustrates  detailed  interconnections  between  the three 
concepts and other antecedent terminologies. As shown in 
Figure 6, there are intrinsic interlinkages between these three 
concepts  and other  concepts  such as data analytics,  augmented 
reality, machine learning – all related to advanced 
computational techniques.  
There are a host of possibilities for the application of 
technologies such as DT and VR to actively address water 
management concerns specific to river basins in developing 
African  countries.  The unique  characteristics  DT and VR offer 
respectively  and when  combined provide  useful  real-time data 
to allow  for the continuous monitoring of river basins. Firstly, 
DT and VR offer accessible realistic digital visualizations 
which enable integrated river basin modelling. While DT 
establishes a real -time virtual representation of the river basin 
presenting water flow, dam operations, pollution sources and 
other environmental elements, VR allows for the visual 
navigation of the DT model and permits interactivity where 
users may directly impact the virtual environment they are 
visiting using their senses including sight, touch, smell and 
hearing to observe the real -time condition of river basins.  
River basins play a pivotal role in supplying fresh water and 
regulating water flow and quality. A DT and VR 
collaboratively  may be used to monitor the physical condition 
of the river basins. The DT will provide the data analytics 
required while VR will allow scientists and engineers to 
conduct virtual inspections and assessments eliminating the 
need for them to be physically present. Lastly, in the case of 
water  crises  such as droughts  or floods  the data extracted  from  the DT can  be analysed  to predict  heavy  rainfalls  that may 
cause  floods  or increased  evapotranspiration  and the over- 
extraction of ground water that may cause droughts.  
Concurrently,  VR can be employed  to pre-visualize  droughts 
and floods  before  they occur  to implement  prevention  tactics 
or mitigate the impact if inevitable.  
An exemplary  case study where DT and VR has been  utilized 
cooperatively  to combat  agricultural  related  challenges  can be 
seen through AgroIT, a company that provides technological 
solutions for the agricultural sector, particularly focusing on 
precision agriculture. AgroIT's platform uses Digital Twin 
technology to create a virtual representation of farmlands, 
incorporating data like soil conditions, weather, and crop 
health. On the VR front, they have explored its use for 
visualizing these digital farms. This combination allows 
farmers to virtually 'walk' through their fields, visualize 
potential problem areas, and make informed decisions about 
irrigation, fertilization and other operations1. 
The ambitions  of DT and VR for environmental  application in 
developing countries based on its previous uses are to aid in 
water resource management systems. This one day may be as 
advanced as integrated user interfaces. Virtual reality is also 
known as an ‘empathy machine’ because of its unique ability 
to immerse users in emotionally charged perspectives, 
experiences, and environments which may prompt positive 
actions  and behaviors  in real life. Through  the advancement  of 
brain -computer interfaces users might control DT simulations 
or navigate VR environments using their thoughts. This could 
lead to more intuitive user experiences and might even allow 
for emotion -driven simulations, where users can ""feel"" the 
impacts of different river management decisions. DT and VR 
technologies strategically locate themselves at the heart of 
digital innovation as solution -based methods that directly 
address the need for visual representations to accurately 
measure the state of water, food and land conditions within 
various  regions  susceptible to food and water wastage, natural 
disasters and shortages. Researchers and scientists look 
forward to the progression of these technologies and the 
problems they will solve in the water management sector. A 
consideration of the manner we orient and define DT and VR 
as their operations evolve and their capacity expands will be 
essential to the integration and assimilation of these ever - 
changing digital innovations.

4. Stakeholder  Needs  Assessment  
DT models are anchored on data from various life cycle 
phases that ought to be collected and analyzed to deliver 
services to a myriad of stakeholders. The utility of the DT 
services is dependent on the level of alignment with 
stakeholder needs. In order ensure uptake of the DT services, 
there  is need  to undertake  stakeholder  engagement  through  the 
development phases of the DT design and implementation.  
Stakeholders are defined as all groups and individuals who 
influence the aims of an organization, project or product and 
vice versa (Freeman and McVea, 2005). As part of  
stakeholder analysis, the stakeholders, their interests and their 
characteristics are identified. This is followed by clustering 
and prioritization  of the stakeholders.  After  analysis,  a strategy 
and recommended actions can be defined (Ramirez, 1999).  
From the DT design and implementation perspective, a 
stakeholder typology reported in Mitchael et al., (1997) as 
well as stakeholder identification based on the interest - 
influence matrix  reported in  e.g., Janssens  de Bisthoven  et al., 
(2022) should be considered. All the DT use cases relevant to 
river -based  management  presented  in Section  7.2, undertook  a 
well-designed iterative stakeholder engagement process  
during the design and implementation of the DT.  
5. 3D Representation  of a River  Basin  Digital 
Twin  
The emergence  of digital  twin technology  has revolutionized 
several fields,  from  manufacturing  to urban  planning  (Tao  et 
al., 2018).  The application  of this innovative  concept  to river basin management using the 3D Representation provides a 
compelling overview of the potential benefits and challenges 
faced.  A river  basin,  being  a complex  system  with a myriad of 
interrelated components such as water flow, sediment 
transport, vegetation, and human interventions, necessitates a 
robust modeling approach. The three -dimensional 
representation in the mentioned work provides a vivid and 
detailed visualization of these elements, making it an 
invaluable tool for stakeholders.  
6. Data  Infrastructure  Architecture  for a Digital 
Twin  
The envisioned  DT architecture  is often  characterized  by two 
main  typologies  - monitoring  and predictive  DT as  described 
in Figure 7. The monitoring typology  represents the past and 
present dynamics of the physical and social -economic 
properties and interactions with the hydroclimatic 
environment, where a virtual representation is created using 
this data. From the perspective of predictive typology, 
predictive models will use past and present data to create a 
plausible future rendition of the present state of the 
environment.  
As reported  in Brasil  et al. (2022)  and Dhulipala  (2021),  a DT 
conceptual framework comprises the components briefly 
described below (also see Figure 8):  
a) Data  source  layer:  to accurately  represent  the LRB  in a 
digital space, various data sets will be required. These 
data sets ought to represent not only the physical

Figure  8 The physical  environment,  data storage,  digital  environment  and applications  services  of the Digital  Twin  (Adapted  from  Brasil  et al., 2022)  
 
environment but also the biological and chemical 
conditions of the basin. Some of the data sources may 
include, remotely sensed data -from satellites and/or 
drones, hydrological process model data, ground 
observations (e.g., water quality/proxy measurements, 
weather  data,  mobile  app captured  data sets),  and thirty 
party datasets which are often analysis ready (e.g., 
climatic data from  the Digital Earth Africa platform  or 
non-climatic datasets  from  the National Department of 
Statistics).  
b) Data processing layer: One of the key functions of this 
layer is to pre -process and format the various data sets to 
ensure inter -operability among the various strands of the 
data. In addition, this layer executes a set of data 
modelling functions including hydrological process 
modelling, climate data downscaling and bias correction, 
satellite image classing to derive various product 
including  hydroclimatic  extremes  and irrigated  area maps.  
c) Data visualization and analytic layer: Based on the 
outputs  in b), this layer  comprises  GIS-enabled  analytic  tools embedded with dashboards to display various user 
selected features. Some of the key  outputs from  this layer 
would be the early warning messages that denote 
hydroclimatic  extremes,  risk areas  and the general  state of 
the river basin.  
d) Advisory and dissemination layer: this layer is a rule 
engine  embedded  decision  support  rule system  that helps 
provide intelligent management options suited for the 
present  and future  physical  state of the river  basin.  These 
decisions are often disseminated using channels such as 
SMS/USSD, web and mobile applications, and even 
tower broadcasts once the system is implemented.  
7. Digital  Twin Data  Governance Framework  
At the heart of the DT, is the data collection, curation, 
management, analysis as well as output of data (Figure 8). 
Since  DT information  can be viewed  as the high-end utility  of 
all the data sets, a strong  data foundation  is necessary.  To this 
end, a robust data foundation is underpinned by a strong data 
governance2 and data management3 strategy (see Plotkin,  
 
 
 
2 Data  governance  is the formal  oversight,  execution  and enforcement  of authority  over the management  of data. 
3 Data  management  is the effective  management  of data to achieve  goals  i.e. it ensures  that an organization  gets value  out of its data while  minimizing  operating  risk.

Figure  9 Data  domains  (Source:  Khatri  and Brown,  2010)  
 
2020;  Conarado,  2014).  In the context  of DT, the four decision 
domains of data governance reported in Khatri and Brown, 
(2010) are appropriate. Thus, a data governance framework 
could comprise; a) data principles (at the top) which are 
intended to establish the direction for all other decision 
domains, and set the boundary requirements for uses of data 
assets, thereby addressing standards for data quality; b) the 
data quality then determines how data are interpreted 
(metadata) as well as accessed (data access) by users; and c) 
the data life -cycle decision which defines the production, 
retention and retirement of data assets (Alhassan et al., 2016).  
The aim of the DT for river basin management could be seen 
as the exhaustive capture of all physical environment 
parameters which are often intrinsically linked to aspects of 
people's  lives, and intellectual property. Determining how  this 
information is shared between organizations and individuals 
will naturally require some data sharing policy (Jones et al., 
2020).  This even  more  so when  referring  to both physical  and 
virtual  entities - to what  extent  does DT data ownership  go? As 
a result, the question  of ownership encompasses who accesses 
the data and for what purpose. As reported in Jones et. al., 
(2020), there are social and cultural implications associated 
with the large -scale collection, storage, and sharing of data 
through the Digital Twin that need to be fully addressed 
through a data governance framework.  
While co -designed data governance framework could 
accelerate  access  and use of data and services  of the DT, the 
following key challenges ought to be overcome;  a) Cataloguing  for all the available  data collected  by 
separate  and distinct  scientists  and/or  institutions,  
b) Understanding  the data in the proper  context  and the need 
to link similar data sets together,  
c) Akin to many sectors such as financial services, retail, 
and healthcare companies, there may be a lack of 
resources  (e.g.,  data stewards)  to curate  and maintain  the 
quality of the data.  
 
8. Digital  Twin  for River  Basins Applications  
8.1. Digital  Twin  for decision  making  at the river  basin - 
level 
The utility  of DT applications  at basin  level  lies in the inherent 
adaptive capability wherein the near -real time river basin 
processes will be captured. As a result, any reactive measures 
(including  plausible  futures)  lead to improved  efficiency  of the 
basin operations, optimized uncertainty measures, early 
warning  detection  and generally  good  emergency  management 
(Pal et al., 2023). These salient features are supported by 
embedding AI algorithms with the DT architecture. The AI  
has the capability of providing additional insights beyond  
what the sensors provide t","9442"

1PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
The HER+ initiative, in partnership with the Alliance of Bioversity International 
and CIAT, WorldVeg, and SNV, collaborates with the Lersha platform by Green Agro Solution PLC. This partnership aligns its vision with HER+ to support the 
Veggies for Planet and People (V4P&P) project intervention through integrating 
social innovations - digital advisory services, input provision, market linkages, and access to finance for over 4,500 vegetable producers in the Wolmera and Ejere Woredas. The focus is on promoting sustainable agriculture and rural development in the West Show Zone of the Oromia region. Key highlights of the 
project include extensive farmer registration efforts, the engagement of 12 active 
agents, and the establishment of four retailer shops within the two woredas.
Objectives
The HER+ initiative aims to support the Veggies for Planet and People (V4P&P) project intervention. This support involves co-designing socio-technical innovation bundles, which include digital solutions. The aim is to enhance 
the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in the Wolmera and Ejere woredas by 
improving their access to social and technical bundles such as agricultural inputs, knowledge, and financial services. Ultimately, this effort would contribute to increasing the region’s agricultural productivity and food security as farmers become more empowered and resilient.

TECHNICAL PROGRESS REPORT
2MILESTONES ACHIEVED
Project Launch:
The project officially began on July 1, 2023, with the signing of the funding 
agreement.
The second phase aimed to lay the groundwork for successful project 
implementation. The project’s scope and objectives were meticulously defined during this phase through extensive discussions.
Stakeholder Engagement: 
Key stakeholders, including local partners and relevant authorities, were identified and engaged in the planning process.
Project Scope & field assessment: 
The project was geographically focused on the West Showa Zone, specifically in the Wolmera and Ejere woredas, indicating a localized and targeted approach.
The HER+ Initiative involved an in-depth field assessment of various aspects 
of agriculture in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. The findings revealed the predominant cultivation of a variety of vegetables by women farmers, guided by well-documented cropping calendars and varied productivity. Agricultural practices encompassed soil preparation, seed selection, irrigation, and effective 
input utilization, as well as livestock management and marketing strategies. The 
accessibility and affordability of agricultural inputs, extension services, market services, post-harvest technologies, and financial services exhibited variations between the woredas. Despite challenges, women played pivotal roles in different 
stages of vegetable production. These insights are pivotal for informed decision-
making, facilitating targeted interventions to promote agricultural sustainability and gender equity in the region. Notably, farmers with access to SNV assistance showed significant improvements in various aspects of vegetable production compared to others.
Targeted Farmers: The project aimed to register over 5,000 farmers, focusing 
on women farmers, in the West Showa Zone, specifically in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. This implies a significant outreach effort to include a large portion of the farming community.

PROGRESS REPORT ON HARNESSING GENDER AND SOCIAL EQUALITY FOR RESILIENCE IN AGRI-FOOD SYSTEMS (HER+)
Input Procurement: The registered farmers could conveniently procure 
essential agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides through digital platforms. This can streamline the supply chain, making inputs more 
accessible and cost-effective.
Lersha Agents Training” was delivered at the Green Agro-Solution (GAS) 
office from September 25-26, 2023. The training aimed to refresh and enhance the information and skills of the potential Lersha agents in various areas, 
including agronomy, livestock production, Lersha application practice, and 
communication, entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, gender, and onboarding steps. The training was conducted for two consecutive days, with 12 potential Lersha agents, of which 4 are women from two woredas and the agricultural 
office focal from SNV retailers participating. On the second day, representatives 
from the Woreda agricultural offices and agro-dealers joined the training to encourage the onboarding process. To develop engagement and participation, the training was designed with various group activities, group work, and case studies in combination with PowerPoint slides and brochures. By organizing the 
agents into groups, we encouraged discussion, collaboration, and sharing of 
perspectives and experiences.

Access to Finance and Mobile Digital Wallet: 
Major costs and average costs per hectare were assessed. Sources of finances for vegetable producers varied, and criteria for accessing credit services with financial institutions were noted. The strengths and shortcomings of available 
financial services were identified. 
Lersha introduced access to financial services and digital wallets for farmers, 
offering financial inclusion and convenience. One of the critical aspects of agricultural development is providing financial support to farmers. Farmers 
could explore financial services through their digital profiles, including credit 
options, savings accounts, and insurance, thus addressing their financial needs and uncertainties. Also, Lersha aimed to offer flexibility to farmers by allowing them to choose from several Digital mobile wallet options, such as CBE, 
Telebirr, and Dube mobile wallets for conducting financial transactions.

Operational Challenges 
• Weak Mobile Network Infrastructure: In some project areas, particularly in 
remote rural locations, mobile network infrastructure was weak. This posed challenges for providing timely advisory services and supporting digital 
transactions.
• Lack of Smartphones: Some Lersha agents faced challenges due to the 
absence of smartphones. The Lersha platform heavily relies on mobile technology for data collection and communication. 
• Market Price Fluctuations: The horticultural market experienced fluctuations 
in produce prices. These fluctuations had an impact on farmers’ income and 
financial planning. The project worked on strategies to help farmers manage these market dynamics and enhance their resilience.
• Extreme Weather Events: Unpredictable and extreme weather events, such 
as droughts or heavy rains, affected crop yields and farm operations in some 
areas. These events highlighted the importance of climate advisory services and climate-resilient agricultural practices, which the project was actively promoting.
• Risk of Loan Default: With the introduction of micro-loans, there was a risk of loan default by some farmers due to various factors, including market 
uncertainties and external shocks. The project closely monitored loan repayment 
rates and provided support to farmers facing challenges meeting their financial obligations.

Key stakeholders, including local partners and relevant authorities, were identified and engaged in the planning process.
Project Scope & field assessment: 
The project was geographically focused on the West Showa Zone, specifically in the Wolmera and Ejere woredas, indicating a localized and targeted approach.
The HER+ Initiative involved an in-depth field assessment of various aspects 
of agriculture in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. The findings revealed the predominant cultivation of a variety of vegetables by women farmers, guided by well-documented cropping calendars and varied productivity. Agricultural practices encompassed soil preparation, seed selection, irrigation, and effective 
input utilization, as well as livestock management and marketing strategies. The 
accessibility and affordability of agricultural inputs, extension services, market services, post-harvest technologies, and financial services exhibited variations between the woredas. Despite challenges, women played pivotal roles in different 
stages of vegetable production. These insights are pivotal for informed decision-
making, facilitating targeted interventions to promote agricultural sustainability and gender equity in the region. Notably, farmers with access to SNV assistance showed significant improvements in various aspects of vegetable production compared to others.
Targeted Farmers: The project aimed to register over 5,000 farmers, focusing 
on women farmers, in the West Showa Zone, specifically in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. This implies a significant outreach effort to include a large portion of the farming community.

The wild relatives of this crop are deemed a vast potential source of useful alleles to adapt to this stress. A nested association mapping (NAM) panel was generated using as a recurrent parent the Moroccan variety ‘Nachit’ derived from Triticum dicoccoides and known for its large grain size. This was recombined to three top-performing lines derived from T. dicoccoides, T. araraticum, and Aegilops speltoides, for a total of 426 inbred progenies. This NAM was evaluated across eight environments (Syria, Lebanon, and Morocco) experiencing different degrees of terminal moisture stress over two crop seasons. Our results showed that drought stress caused on average 41% loss in yield and that 1,000-kernel weight (TKW) was the most important trait for adaptation to it. Genotyping with the 25K TraitGenetics array resulted in a consensus map of 1,678 polymorphic SNPs, spanning 1,723 cM aligned to the reference ‘Svevo’ genome assembly. Kinship distinguished the progenies in three clades matching the parent of origin. A total of 18 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified as controlling various traits but independent from flowering time. The most significant genomic regions were named Q.ICD.NAM-04, Q.ICD.NAM-14, and Q.ICD.NAM-16. Allelic investigation in a second germplasm panel confirmed that carrying the positive allele at all three loci produced an average TKW advantage of 25.6% when field-tested under drought conditions. The underlying SNPs were converted to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers and successfully validated in a third germplasm set, where they explained up to 19% of phenotypic variation for TKW under moisture stress.

In other words, barriers to progress are typically viewed as issues of technology adoption, not as part of the innovation process itself. This study contributes to changing the paradigm by proposing a living lab approach, which considers innovation as an adaptive process where stakeholders co-produce knowledge and collaborate based on inclusivity and empowerment. Our specific concept for this approach is called a Living Lab for People (LL4P). This conceptual paper outlines a framework to guide the development of a LL4P that remains flexible to be adapted for specific sites. While we seek to identify common denominators, we recognize the necessity for such a framework to remain open enough to be adaptable for varied contexts. Consequently, the framework draws on the living lab literature but tailors existing approaches for sustainable food system transformation and puts people (men, women, and marginalized groups among key food system actors) at the center of innovation processes with a clear intention to address power and social inequity. We draw on specific cases in China, Colombia, Kenya and Vietnam as learning grounds for formulating LL4Ps through locally led innovation processes. Based on our learnings and consultations, we define a LL4P as an inclusive and diverse space for people to advance their socio-technical innovation processes and associated modes of governance within a facilitated organizational structure. The principles of LL4Ps include co-production, gender equality and social inclusion, governance and institutional sustainability to advance existing and novel innovation processes. The practical experiences from applying this framework in the four case studies indicate alternative pathways for transforming the food system toward a sustainable and socially equitable trajectory through the establishment of a LL4P.

Coordinated through its Living Labs for People, in collaboration with China Academy of Rural Development of Zhejiang University, School of Economics of Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, and Government of Yuhang District, the CGIAR Research Initiative on Low-Emission Food Systems (Mitigate+) started developing a research-for-impact partnership with the Qingshan Village in 2023. Merged from three small villages, Qingshan Village covers an area of 45.6 km2 and has a registered population of 2,662. The village has three medium-sized reservoirs, with approximately 80% of the land area covered by forests. Bamboo forestry occupies 90% of the village’s agricultural land, with the remaining agricultural land utilized for rice, tea, and vegetable cultivation. In 2022, agricultural production value reached 90 million RMB (US$12.5 million). Bamboo forestry, which encompasses the production of raw materials and bamboo shoots, represents the primary source of agricultural income for many local farmers.

For example, in Kenya, an agreement has been signed with Kaimosi Agricultural Training Centre to establish the LL4P and set up a governing board. In China, Qinghan Village has been selected by the government as a 'Low carbon future village,' and the LL4P is using the already established frameworks to understand the pathways to low emission food system in Qingshan.

In other words, barriers to progress are typically viewed as issues of technology adoption, not as part of the innovation process itself. This study contributes to changing the paradigm by proposing a living lab approach, which considers innovation as an adaptive process where stakeholders co-produce knowledge and collaborate based on inclusivity and empowerment. Our specific concept for this approach is called a Living Lab for People (LL4P). This conceptual paper outlines a framework to guide the development of a LL4P that remains flexible to be adapted for specific sites. While we seek to identify common denominators, we recognize the necessity for such a framework to remain open enough to be adaptable for varied contexts. Consequently, the framework draws on the living lab literature but tailors existing approaches for sustainable food system transformation and puts people (men, women, and marginalized groups among key food system actors) at the center of innovation processes with a clear intention to address power and social inequity. We draw on specific cases in China, Colombia, Kenya and Vietnam as learning grounds for formulating LL4Ps through locally led innovation processes. Based on our learnings and consultations, we define a LL4P as an inclusive and diverse space for people to advance their socio-technical innovation processes and associated modes of governance within a facilitated organizational structure. The principles of LL4Ps include co-production, gender equality and social inclusion, governance and institutional sustainability to advance existing and novel innovation processes. The practical experiences from applying this framework in the four case studies indicate alternative pathways for transforming the food system toward a sustainable and socially equitable trajectory through the establishment of a LL4P.

A Comprehensive Review of Land Use, Food Systems, and Socio-Economic Drivers The drivers of deforestation and land use change in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes are complex and interconnected, shaped by various factors, including agricultural expansion, wood extraction, mining, infrastructure development, climate change, and socio-economic factors. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of these drivers and their impacts on the environment and local communities. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that accounts for both direct and underlying drivers and the unique context of each region. Effective management strategies must consider the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of these challenges. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving forest governance, empowering local communities, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders are crucial steps to protecting Peru’s natural resources. These measures can help balance economic development with environmental conservation, ensuring the sustainable use of land and resources. Equally important is addressing the underlying social and economic factors that drive land use change, including poverty, population growth, and migration. These factors often exacerbate environmental degradation and need to be integrated into broader development and conservation strategies.
A holistic approach that acknowledges the distinct challenges faced by the Amazon and Andean regions, can contribute to face deforestation as well as ensure the well-being of local communities, biodiversity conservation, and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. Such an approach requires coordinated efforts from government, non-governmental organizations, local communities, and international partners to create effective and sustainable solutions.

The drivers of deforestation and land use change in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes are complex and 
interconnected, shaped by various factors, including agricultural expansion, wood extraction, mining, infrastructure 
development, climate change, and socio -economic factors. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of these 
drivers and their impacts on the environment and local communities.  Addressing these issues requires a 
comprehensive approach that accounts for both direct and underlying drivers and the unique context of each 
region. Effective management strategies must consider the ecological, s ocial, and economic dimensions of these 
challenges. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving forest governance, empowering local 
communities, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders are crucial steps to protecting Peru’s natural 
resources. These measures can help balance economic development with environmental conservation, ensuring 
the sustainable use of land and resources. Equally important is addressing the underlying social and economic 
factors that drive land use change, includi ng poverty, population growth, and migration. These factors often 
exacerbate environmental degradation and need to be integrated into broader development and conservation 
strategies.  
A holistic approach that acknowledges the distinct challenges faced by the Amazon and Andean regions, can 
contribute to face deforestation as well as ensure the well -being of local communities, biodiversity conservation, 
and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. Such an approach requires coordinated efforts fro m 
government, non -governmental organizations, local communities, and international partners to create effective and 
sustainable solutions.

ABSTRACT  
Page 5:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  4 
 Peru is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its unique geographical location and 
socioeconomic conditions (Oliver -Smith, 2014) . The country is particularly susceptible to climate change effects, 
such as increased frequency of extreme weather events, enhanced glacier retreat, loss of biodiversity, increased soil 
erosion risk, among others (Correa et al., 2016; Heikkinen, 2017; Zevallos and Lavado -Casimiro, 2022) . Smallholder 
farmers face significant challenges adapting to these changes, as their livelihoods are closely tied to natural 
resources (Heikkinen, 2017; Lennox, 2015) . Moreover, socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, food insecurity, poor 
health, and marginalization, exacerbate these vulnerabilities and make it difficult for communities to adapt 
(Heikkinen, 2021; Oliver -Smith, 2014) . 
In Peru, climate change has intensified hydrometeorological hazards, such as torrential rainfalls, floods, and glacier 
retreat, leading to migration within the country (Bergmann et al., 2021) . The country's geographic, economic, 
developmental, social, demographic, and environmental characteristics vary between its regions, making them 
vulnerable to different levels of climate change impacts (Hoffman and Grigera, 2013) . 
The climate hazards are exacerbated in the Peruvian Andes and Amazon because of the high levels of poverty and 
inequality, with major deficiencies in basic services and threats related to environmental degradation, climate 
change, and pressure on water sou rces in the coastal and Andean areas, resulting in social tension and violence 
centered on the environmental impacts of extractive industries and large infrastructure projects. Also, melting 
glaciers are shrinking dry -season water supplies, disrupting rura l highland society, and sparking migration (Hoffman 
and Grigera, 2013) . 
Climate hazards among other factors have push migration from the Andes highlands to the Amazon, together with 
aspiration of access new land (Ichikawa et al., 2014) . Immigrants from the Andes often move to the Amazon for better 
opportunities and resource access, contributing to deforestation and environmental degradation in the region 
(Menton and Cronkleton, 2019) . 
In turn, deforestation affects the carbon stock by releasing carbon stored in trees and soils, contributing to 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (Achard et al., 2014) . Loss of forest cover also reduces the capacity 
of forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. According to the IPCC Special 
Report on Climate Change and Land 2019 (IPCC, 2019a) , the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sector is the 
second largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, second only to burning fossil fuels. During 2007 -
2016, land use and land -use change are estimated to have generated net CO2 emissio ns of 5.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr -1 
(IPCC, 2019b) . Deforestation was the main cause of net CO2 emissions, as well as soil cultivation and oxidation of 
wood products, among others. In the western Amazon, specifically in the Madre de Dios region, forest loss was at 
an annual rate of -0.21% between 1999 and  2018 (Alarcón et al., 2021) . In addition, Asner et al. (2010)  reported that 
over 4.3 million ha of the Peruvian Amazon between 1999 and 2009, emissions from land use totaled 1.1% of the 
standing carbon and forest degradation increased regional carbon emissions by 47% over deforestation alone, 
while secondary regrowt h provided an 18% offset against total gross emissions.  
Peru is among the nations that have ratified the Paris Agreement. Through its Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), Peru has committed to reducing its annual GHG emissions by 30% in 2030 compared to a business -as-usual 
scenario. An established target  in these NDCs is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the 
forestry sector and land -use changes (LUCs) by 43.1 MtCO2eq by 2030, which represents more than the 50% of the 
total reduction committed by that year (MINAM, 2019) . In contrast, deforestation rates increased by 58% in 2009 -
2016 compared to 2001 -2008 (MINAM, 2016; Vázquez -Rowe et al., 2019) . In this sense, identifying and addressing 
the direct and underlying drivers of deforestation and land use change is essential for effective national strategies. 
This study aims to analyze these main drivers, particularly focusing on the interconnected re gions of the Andes and 
the Amazon.  
Some studies have been done to predict deforestation across the Peruvian Amazon, such as applying machine 
learning algorithms or other related tools. Using such methods could help improve strategies for reducing future 1 INTRODUCTION

 deforestation and preserving carbon stocks in Peru and other forest regions (Rojas et al., 2021) . Additionally, high 
spatial resolution monitoring of aboveground carbon density (ACD) and emissions (ACE) in Peru revealed a total of 
7.138 Pg C estimated for the country, with an annual ACE of 20.08 Tg C between the third quarters of 2017 and 
2018 (Csillik and Asner, 2020a) . This finding underscores the need for enhanced forest carbon management at scale 
to mitigate climate change.  
Understanding the impact of land management practices on soil carbon dynamics in Peruvian ecosystems is 
essential for implementing effective conservation and restoration policies. Oliver et al. (2017)  found that grazing and 
burning increased soil CO2 fluxes and decomposition rates in Peruvian montane grasslands. Still, long -term carbon 
storage in occluded light fractions and heavy fractions was not negatively impacted. This is useful for designing 
appropriate land -use management strategies that do not compromise the carbon storage capacity of these 
ecosystems.  
This document focuses on the Andes and Amazon conditions where climate hazards affect a large number of 
smallholders and produce the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. The insights gained from 
this study are crucial for informing po licy decisions and conservation efforts, not only in Peru but also in other regions 
facing similar challenges.  
2.1 NATURAL CAPITAL AND CLIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DEFORESTATION IN THE 
AMAZON AND ANDES  
The Amazon rainforest, a vital ecosystem for global carbon regulation and a significant reservoir of natural capital, 
is critical in mitigating climate change and preserving biodiversity (Azevedo et al., 2020; Gatti et al., 2021) . The 
interplay between the Andean and Amazonian ecosystems is crucial for regional climate regulation, underscoring 
the need for integrated conservation strategies that consider the dynamics of both regions. Coe et al. (2017)  noted 
that tropical forests play a direct role in maintaining low surface temperatures and high precipitation. Indigenous 
and local communities play a vital role in preserving the natural capital of these regions. Recognizing and integrating 
their traditi onal knowledge and practices is essential for effective and sustainable management of these ecosystems.  
On the other hand, forest degradation from selective logging and understory fires contributes to carbon emissions, 
potentially accounting for up to 40% of carbon loss in the region (Berenguer et al., 2014) . In this sense, some authors 
point out that addressing deforestation and degradation requires implementing policies that consider aspects such 
as reducing forest fires and increasing the area of secondary forests while avoiding further removal of primary forests 
(Arag ão et al., 2014; Azevedo et al., 2020) . Incentives for better forest management and integrating local, regional, 
national, and international policies are also noted as necessary to adapt to and mitigate climate change (Azevedo 
et al., 2020) . For instance, a study by Barua et al. (2012)  found that carbon payments could effectively reduce forest 
clearing and pointed out that an effective policy to combat tropical deforestation should jointly consider the forestry 
and cash -crop sectors. Some authors point out that policies and programs lik e Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) should support existing efforts towards forest sustainability and 
balance economic development with the protection of natural capital to ensure the long -term viability of these 
critical  ecosystems (Bottazzi et al., 2014; Galford et al., 2011) .  
In 2016, Aguiar et al. noted a decrease in deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, stabilizing around 6,000 km2 
yr−1 in the previous five years of their study. They stated that while a combination of factors contributed to the 
decreased deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, including creating protected areas, effective monitoring 
systems, and credit restriction m echanisms, several threats remained, such as rapidly expanding global markets for 
agricultural commodities, large -scale transportation and energy infrastructure projects, and weak institutions 
(Aguiar et al., 2016) . In contrast, Murugasan et al. (2019) , modeling deforestation scenarios, concluded that the 2 CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND VULNERABILITY IN 
THE ANDES AND AMAZON

 Amazon Basin is at risk of significant deforestation, with the forested area predicted to be reduced by about half by 
2050 under the Business -as-Usual scenario and if the current rate of deforestation continues, the world´s forests 
could dissolve within th e next 100 years.  
On the other hand, the high Andes region is home to diverse ecosystems crucial in carbon sequestration and climate 
regulation, such as paramo grasslands, montane cloud forests, and high -altitude wetlands (Peña et al., 2011) . Andean 
forests act as strong sinks for aboveground carbon and have a high potential to serve as future carbon refuges 
(Duque et al., 2021) . As climate change continues to impact these regions, adaptive management strategies that 
can respond to evolving environmental conditions are crucial for the sustainability of these ecosystems and the 
communities that depend on them. For instance, montan e cloud forests in the high Andes, such as those in Manu 
National Park, Peru, are also significant carbon stores. Improved management of these ecosystems can generate 
additional income for rural communities by commercializing carbon credits (Gibbon et al., 2010) . Also, Andean 
peatlands are essential for carbon and nitrogen accumulation. Understanding the factors affecting the accumulation 
of these elements in peatlands is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change on these ecosystems (León and 
Oliván, 2014) . In addition, the Andean plateau contains significant soil organic carbon (SOC) reservoirs, which are 
vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic activities, such as changes in land use and water management 
(Muñoz et al., 2015) . 
The region faces numerous challenges, including land use change, deforestation, and climate change, which affect 
carbon storage and the livelihoods of local communities (Barrera et al., 2012) . Although several projects have been 
implemented to promote environmentally friendly farming practices and soil and water conservation techniques, 
economic development in the Andean region is often hampered by extreme poverty, low agricultural productivit y, 
and limited off -farm opportunities. Exploring sustainable economic opportunities, such as ecotourism and 
sustainable harvesting of non -timber forest products, could provide alternative income sources for local 
communities while contributing to conservat ion efforts.  
Deforestation and land -use change have been significant sources of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in South 
America, with pasture expansion, commercial cropland, and infrastructure development often noted as some of the 
main drivers (De Sy et al., 2015) . While there are policies in place aimed at protecting these ecosystems, challenges 
in implementation and enforcement remain significant. Strengthening governance and institutional capacities is 
crucial for the effective management of these regions. In th e Andean community countries, there is a bidirectional 
relationship between economic growth, consumption of energy, and CO 2 emissions (Koengkan et al., 2018) . To 
ensure the sustainable development and protection of these ecosystems, it is essential to implement effective land 
use policies, promote environmentally friendly practices, and address the economic and social challenges local 
communities face.  
2.1.1  Amazon ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The Amazon is a critical carbon sink in the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation. Its ecosystems, 
including the rainforest, peatlands, mangroves, and transitional forests, store substantial carbon. These ecosystems 
are essential for optimizing  conservation efforts and maintaining global climate stability.  
The Amazon rainforest has been a long -term net biomass sink, although the rate of carbon accumulation has 
decreased over recent decades (Brienen et al., 2015) . Rödig et al. (2018)  found that the Amazon rainforest gains 
0.56 GtC per year, driven by a mean gross primary productivity (GPP) of 25.1 tC ha-1 a-1 and a mean woody 
aboveground net primary productivity (wANPP) of 4.2 tC ha-1 a-1. The study also found that forest structure and 
successional states are essential factors in the relationship between productivity and biomass, highlighting the need 
for forest management strategies that consider these aspects.  
Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, but human disturbances, such as selective logging, 
understory fires, and habitat fragmentation, affect carbon stocks and emissions. Disturbed forests store 40% less 
aboveground carbon on average compar ed to undisturbed forests and are structurally similar to secondary forests. 
Carbon emissions from these disturbances are significant and could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from 
deforestation in the Amazon (Berenguer et al., 2014) . 
Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests in the tropics, contributing disproportionately to the 
carbon sequestration (Alongi, 2014) . The Brazilian Amazon has one of the largest areas of mangroves in the world, 
Page 8:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  7 
 storing substantial amounts of carbon. The mean ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves east of the Amazon River 
ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha-1, with the Amazon mangroves storing over twice the amount of carbon than upland 
evergreen forests and almost ten times the amount found in tropical dry forests (Kauffman et al., 2018) . However, 
potential carbon losses due to deforestation are of immediate concern, with rates greater than these ecosystems' 
carbon storage (Alongi, 2014) . 
The dry transitional forests in southern Amazonia have received less attention but represent important carbon -
cycling ecosystems (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . These forests exhibit higher leaf photosynthesis and total GPP 
due to drier soil conditions favoring dry deciduous tree species. Carbon allocation patterns are similar to those in 
wetter humid forests, with the dry forests of southern Amazonia acting as a scaled -down version of their humid 
counterparts (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . 
Amazonian peatlands store significant amounts of carbon, with tropical peatlands accounting for about half of the 
global peatland emitted carbon (Ribeiro et al., 2021) . For instance, the Amazon's Pastaza -Marañón Foreland Basin 
(PMFB) is among the largest known intact tropical peatland landscapes globally and is considered highly threatened 
due to human activities such as deforestation and agricultural expansion (Roucoux et al., 2017) . Peatlands in 
Amazonian Peru cover 35,600 ± 2133 km2 and contain 3.14 (0.44 -8.15) Pg C. Peatland pole forests, in particular, are 
identified as the most carbon -dense ecosystem in Amazonia (1391 ± 710 Mg C ha-1) (Draper et al., 2014) . Swindles 
(2018)  reported that the Aucayacu peatland in the PMFB is the oldest peatland in Amazonia, accumulating peat up 
to 7.5 meters deep in approximately 8,900 years.  
These ecosystems face various threats, including deforestation, agricultural expansion, and climate change. The 
preservation of these ecosystems is not only crucial for carbon sequestration but also for maintaining biodiversity 
and supporting local communi ties. It is crucial to protect these ecosystems and support their role as carbon sinks to 
maintain global climate stability and ensure the success of the Paris Climate Agreement (Walker et al., 2020) . 
Peruvian amazon has several concrete examples of ecosystems that play a key role in mitigating climate change by 
acting as carbon sinks such as palm swamp peatlands and high -altitude grasslands. Understanding their carbon 
storage and dynamics is essential for developing effective conservation and restoration policies (Guerrero -Palomino 
et al., 2022; Hastie et al., 2022; Mu ñoz et al., 2015) . 
Amazon palm swamp peatlands are major carbon sinks and reservoirs, storing significant amounts of carbon 
alongside Andean forests with a strong carbon sink capacity (0.67 ± 0.08 Mg C ha−1 y−1)  (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque 
et al., 2021) . However, these ecosystems are threatened due to deforestation and land -use changes, with the 
Peruvian Amazon losing around 190,000 hectares of forest in 2020 alone (Dourojeanni, 2022) . The ongoing 
degradation of these ecosystems can potentially disrupt peat accretion and reduce carbon stocks, emphasizing the 
need for sustainable management and protection (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque et al., 2021) . 
2.1.2  Andean ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The High Andean ecosystems, such as wetlands, forests, grasslands, and the paramo, puna, and southern Andean 
steppe habitats, are characterized by unique environmental conditions and diverse flora and fauna that contribute 
to various ecosystem services, in cluding carbon accumulation and sequestration (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; 
Arroyo and Cavieres, 2013) . These ecosystems play a critical role in mitigating climate change by storing significant 
amounts of carbon in aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and organic soil (Gibbon et al., 2010; Segnini 
et al., 2011) .  
High Andean wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other habitats are known for their substantial carbon storage 
capacity due to their low decomposition rates, which result from flooded soils, low temperatures, and low soil pH 
(Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Mu ñoz et al., 2015; Oliveras et al., 2014) . Research has shown that these ecosystems store 
significant amounts of carbon in aboveground and belowground biomass, as well as in organic soil, with the latter 
accounting for the highest carbon storage (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Girardin et al., 2014; V ásquez et al., 2014) . In a 
study centered on the cloud forest -grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru, Gibbon et al. 
(2010)  found that the puna grasslands stored 7.5 ± 0.7 Mg C ha-1 in aboveground biomass, while the forest near the 
treeline contained 63.4 ± 5.2 Mg C ha-1 aboveground and an additional 13.9 ± 2.8 Mg C ha-1 in the coarse roots.  
Page 9:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  8 
 The unique environmental conditions of the High Andean ecosystems, such as cold and wet climate, low 
atmospheric pressure, and low soil pH, contribute to the accumulation of organic matter and carbon storage (Muñoz 
et al., 2015, 2013) . Organic matter decomposes very slowly in these conditions, and its content increases with altitude. 
Approximately 40 -60% of the soil organic carbon (OC) exists within the top 20 -cm layer, with a high C/N ratio in the 
Andean highlands indicating intense h umification (Muñoz et al., 2015) . Segnini et al . (2011)  determined carbon 
contents and carbon stocks in five Peruvian agroecologies along a 1,000 km transect and found that soils in the 
tropical highland rainforest site had the highest carbon contents (134 g kg -1 [13.4%]) and that diversified production 
systems with crops and livestock were more stable for carbon stocks.  
Human activities, such as grazing, burning, and land use changes, can negatively impact the carbon storage capacity 
of high Andean ecosystems and their biodiversity (Muñoz et al., 2013; Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . These 
disturbances can reduce the net primary productivity (NPP) of the puna grasslands and result in the loss of grasslands 
and montane forests due to agriculture and other land use changes (Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . 
Consequently, it is essential to implement strategies to protect these ecosystems and their essential functions, 
including their roles as stable carbon reservoirs and habitats for threatened species.  
The tropical montane forest ecosystems of the Peruvian Andes are under threat from climate change, which is 
expected to have a high potential impact on 58% of all montane forests, particularly in the elevation range between 
800 and 1200 m.a.s.l (Bax et al., 2021) . Moreover, about 64% of montane forests in protected areas will be exposed 
to high potential impact. Enhancing the adaptive capacity of these ecosystems through restorative and preventive 
conservation measures, such as improving forest functions and mitig ating deforestation and forest degradation 
pressures, is crucial for their survival (Bax et al., 2021) . 
Andean peatlands, particularly those formed by cushion plants, and high -altitude grasslands in the Andean plateau, 
such as the puna, are vital carbon sinks in Peru. These peatlands and grasslands are influenced by climate change 
and human activities, such as grazing, ditching, and unsuitable water management, which alter hydrologic 
conditions and degrade these essential carbon reservoirs (Muñoz et al., 2015; Planas -Clarke et al., 2020) . Hydrologic 
restoration, such as rewetting of moderately drained peatlands, could help moderate climate change's impacts on 
Andean peatlands and increase their ability to store carbon (Planas -Clarke et al., 2020)  
2.2 Vulnerability to climate change in Peru  
Climate change poses significant risks to Peru, making the country highly vulnerable to food insecurity, floods, 
landslides, water scarcity, vector -borne diseases, coastal risks, and systemic failures due to cascading impacts of 
hazards and epidemics, amon g others (Hagen et al., 2022) . Inequities in water governance and changes in the 
hydrology of Peru due to glacial retreat are magnifying vulnerabilities in communities, food producers, and poor 
urban neighbourhoods  (Lynch, 2012) . These challenges underscore the need for comprehensive and inclusive 
approaches to water management and climate adaptation strategies. Various adaptation measures have been 
identified to address these risks, but the low adaptive capacity and climate chan ge may limit their effectiveness 
(Hagen et al., 2022) . Furthermore, there is a need for increased investment in building adaptive capacities at local 
and national levels to enhance resilience against climate change. Additionally, adaptation strategies have limited 
attention, which is insufficient for the cou ntry (Takahashi and Meisner, 2012) . 
Climate change affects the food systems in Peru, with implications for agricultural production, food security, and the 
livelihoods of smallholder farmers (Lozano -Povis et al., 2021; Tito et al., 2018) . The Andean region is highly 
vulnerable to climate change, with increased rainfall intensity, soil erosion, retreat of glaciers, and loss of vegetation 
cover, all impacting crop dynamics. Innovative agricultural practices and technologies, such as climate -smart 
agriculture, are essential to adapt to these changing conditions.  In this regard, Peru's food production and crop 
yields are also negatively affected, especially for crops such as quinoa, potatoes, and tarwi (Lozano -Povis et al., 
2021) . 
One of the primary challenges to Peru's food systems is ensuring adequate food production and security in the face 
of climate change. Rising temperatures can lead to declining crop yields, forcing farmers to change cultivation 
practices or relocate their c rops to higher elevations. However, such changes may also result in the introduction of 
novel pests and a decline in crop quality and value, leading to severe economic losses for local farmers and food 
insecurity (Tito et al., 2018) .

 2.2.1  Climate -related hazard for the Andes and Amazon  
The climate -related hazards in Peru pose significant threats to the diverse environments, ranging from coastal 
deserts to high Andean mountains and humid Amazon lowlands (Young and Le ón, 2009) . Population growth and urban 
expansion increase the vulnerability of communities to these hazards, which include floods, landslides, glacial 
retreat, and extreme weather events (Oliver -Smith, 2014; Vil ímek et al., 2005) . 
El Niño events are one of the primary climate -related hazards in Peru, causing intense rainfall, ponding water, flash 
floods, and landslides, leading to significant damage to society (Brill et al., 2020) . Damage modelling  based on data -
mining methods and remote sensing products, are some tools used in risk assessments. The integration of these 
advanced technologies with traditional knowledge systems can enhance the accuracy and relevance of risk 
assessments. Also, the topo graphic wetness index and the slope length and steepness factor are crucial features in 
classifying damage from compound natural hazards like El Niño events (Brill et al., 2020) . 
On the other hand, glacier retreat in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range has led to the formation of glacial lakes, 
posing a risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) (Vilímek et al., 2014) . GLOFs are closely connected with dynamic 
slope movements, such as ice - and rock -falls and landslides of steep moraine slopes, accounting for around 80% of 
GLOFs in the region. These outburst floods can lead to highly hazardous debris and mudflows, signif icantly 
impacting the high mountainous environment (Vilímek et al., 2014) . Despite efforts by a Peruvian glaciology and lakes 
security office, glacier disasters killed nearly 30,000 people in five glacier -related disasters in Peru´s Cordillera 
Blanca from 1941 to 1970 (Carey, 2005) . A lack of trust between local communities and government officials has 
exacerbated the problem, where many residents live in hazard zones.  
Andean populations are vulnerable to climate change and disasters due to poverty, food insecurity, poor health, 
and marginalization. According to Oliver -Smith (2014) , to address these vulnerabilities, adaptation policies must 
integrate measures to reduce specific hazards with programs aimed at reducing systemic vulnerabilities and societal 
inequality. This approach should include empowering local communities and ensur ing their active participation in 
decision -making processes.  
Addressing climate -related hazards in Peru requires a better understanding and integration of scientific knowledge 
and local expertise (Salzmann et al., 2009) . For example, physically -based numerical models can help simulate

A Comprehensive Review of Land Use, Food Systems, and Socio-Economic Drivers The drivers of deforestation and land use change in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes are complex and interconnected, shaped by various factors, including agricultural expansion, wood extraction, mining, infrastructure development, climate change, and socio-economic factors. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of these drivers and their impacts on the environment and local communities. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that accounts for both direct and underlying drivers and the unique context of each region. Effective management strategies must consider the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of these challenges. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving forest governance, empowering local communities, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders are crucial steps to protecting Peru’s natural resources.

ABSTRACT  
Page 5:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  4 
 Peru is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its unique geographical location and 
socioeconomic conditions (Oliver -Smith, 2014) . The country is particularly susceptible to climate change effects, 
such as increased frequency of extreme weather events, enhanced glacier retreat, loss of biodiversity, increased soil 
erosion risk, among others (Correa et al., 2016; Heikkinen, 2017; Zevallos and Lavado -Casimiro, 2022) . Smallholder 
farmers face significant challenges adapting to these changes, as their livelihoods are closely tied to natural 
resources (Heikkinen, 2017; Lennox, 2015) . Moreover, socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, food insecurity, poor 
health, and marginalization, exacerbate these vulnerabilities and make it difficult for communities to adapt 
(Heikkinen, 2021; Oliver -Smith, 2014) . 
In Peru, climate change has intensified hydrometeorological hazards, such as torrential rainfalls, floods, and glacier 
retreat, leading to migration within the country (Bergmann et al., 2021) . The country's geographic, economic, 
developmental, social, demographic, and environmental characteristics vary between its regions, making them 
vulnerable to different levels of climate change impacts (Hoffman and Grigera, 2013) . 
The climate hazards are exacerbated in the Peruvian Andes and Amazon because of the high levels of poverty and 
inequality, with major deficiencies in basic services and threats related to environmental degradation, climate 
change, and pressure on water sou rces in the coastal and Andean areas, resulting in social tension and violence 
centered on the environmental impacts of extractive industries and large infrastructure projects. Also, melting 
glaciers are shrinking dry -season water supplies, disrupting rura l highland society, and sparking migration (Hoffman 
and Grigera, 2013) . 
Climate hazards among other factors have push migration from the Andes highlands to the Amazon, together with 
aspiration of access new land (Ichikawa et al., 2014) . Immigrants from the Andes often move to the Amazon for better 
opportunities and resource access, contributing to deforestation and environmental degradation in the region 
(Menton and Cronkleton, 2019) . 
In turn, deforestation affects the carbon stock by releasing carbon stored in trees and soils, contributing to 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (Achard et al., 2014) . Loss of forest cover also reduces the capacity 
of forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. According to the IPCC Special 
Report on Climate Change and Land 2019 (IPCC, 2019a) , the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sector is the 
second largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, second only to burning fossil fuels. During 2007 -
2016, land use and land -use change are estimated to have generated net CO2 emissio ns of 5.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr -1 
(IPCC, 2019b) . Deforestation was the main cause of net CO2 emissions, as well as soil cultivation and oxidation of 
wood products, among others. In the western Amazon, specifically in the Madre de Dios region, forest loss was at 
an annual rate of -0.21% between 1999 and  2018 (Alarcón et al., 2021) . In addition, Asner et al. (2010)  reported that 
over 4.3 million ha of the Peruvian Amazon between 1999 and 2009, emissions from land use totaled 1.1% of the 
standing carbon and forest degradation increased regional carbon emissions by 47% over deforestation alone, 
while secondary regrowt h provided an 18% offset against total gross emissions.  
Peru is among the nations that have ratified the Paris Agreement. Through its Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), Peru has committed to reducing its annual GHG emissions by 30% in 2030 compared to a business -as-usual 
scenario. An established target  in these NDCs is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the 
forestry sector and land -use changes (LUCs) by 43.1 MtCO2eq by 2030, which represents more than the 50% of the 
total reduction committed by that year (MINAM, 2019) . In contrast, deforestation rates increased by 58% in 2009 -
2016 compared to 2001 -2008 (MINAM, 2016; Vázquez -Rowe et al., 2019) . In this sense, identifying and addressing 
the direct and underlying drivers of deforestation and land use change is essential for effective national strategies. 
This study aims to analyze these main drivers, particularly focusing on the interconnected re gions of the Andes and 
the Amazon.  
Some studies have been done to predict deforestation across the Peruvian Amazon, such as applying machine 
learning algorithms or other related tools. Using such methods could help improve strategies for reducing future 1 INTRODUCTION

 deforestation and preserving carbon stocks in Peru and other forest regions (Rojas et al., 2021) . Additionally, high 
spatial resolution monitoring of aboveground carbon density (ACD) and emissions (ACE) in Peru revealed a total of 
7.138 Pg C estimated for the country, with an annual ACE of 20.08 Tg C between the third quarters of 2017 and 
2018 (Csillik and Asner, 2020a) . This finding underscores the need for enhanced forest carbon management at scale 
to mitigate climate change.  
Understanding the impact of land management practices on soil carbon dynamics in Peruvian ecosystems is 
essential for implementing effective conservation and restoration policies. Oliver et al. (2017)  found that grazing and 
burning increased soil CO2 fluxes and decomposition rates in Peruvian montane grasslands. Still, long -term carbon 
storage in occluded light fractions and heavy fractions was not negatively impacted. This is useful for designing 
appropriate land -use management strategies that do not compromise the carbon storage capacity of these 
ecosystems.  
This document focuses on the Andes and Amazon conditions where climate hazards affect a large number of 
smallholders and produce the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. The insights gained from 
this study are crucial for informing po licy decisions and conservation efforts, not only in Peru but also in other regions 
facing similar challenges.  
2.1 NATURAL CAPITAL AND CLIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DEFORESTATION IN THE 
AMAZON AND ANDES  
The Amazon rainforest, a vital ecosystem for global carbon regulation and a significant reservoir of natural capital, 
is critical in mitigating climate change and preserving biodiversity (Azevedo et al., 2020; Gatti et al., 2021) . The 
interplay between the Andean and Amazonian ecosystems is crucial for regional climate regulation, underscoring 
the need for integrated conservation strategies that consider the dynamics of both regions. Coe et al. (2017)  noted 
that tropical forests play a direct role in maintaining low surface temperatures and high precipitation. Indigenous 
and local communities play a vital role in preserving the natural capital of these regions. Recognizing and integrating 
their traditi onal knowledge and practices is essential for effective and sustainable management of these ecosystems.  
On the other hand, forest degradation from selective logging and understory fires contributes to carbon emissions, 
potentially accounting for up to 40% of carbon loss in the region (Berenguer et al., 2014) . In this sense, some authors 
point out that addressing deforestation and degradation requires implementing policies that consider aspects such 
as reducing forest fires and increasing the area of secondary forests while avoiding further removal of primary forests 
(Arag ão et al., 2014; Azevedo et al., 2020) . Incentives for better forest management and integrating local, regional, 
national, and international policies are also noted as necessary to adapt to and mitigate climate change (Azevedo 
et al., 2020) . For instance, a study by Barua et al. (2012)  found that carbon payments could effectively reduce forest 
clearing and pointed out that an effective policy to combat tropical deforestation should jointly consider the forestry 
and cash -crop sectors. Some authors point out that policies and programs lik e Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) should support existing efforts towards forest sustainability and 
balance economic development with the protection of natural capital to ensure the long -term viability of these 
critical  ecosystems (Bottazzi et al., 2014; Galford et al., 2011) .  
In 2016, Aguiar et al. noted a decrease in deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, stabilizing around 6,000 km2 
yr−1 in the previous five years of their study. They stated that while a combination of factors contributed to the 
decreased deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, including creating protected areas, effective monitoring 
systems, and credit restriction m echanisms, several threats remained, such as rapidly expanding global markets for 
agricultural commodities, large -scale transportation and energy infrastructure projects, and weak institutions 
(Aguiar et al., 2016) . In contrast, Murugasan et al. (2019) , modeling deforestation scenarios, concluded that the 2 CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND VULNERABILITY IN 
THE ANDES AND AMAZON

 Amazon Basin is at risk of significant deforestation, with the forested area predicted to be reduced by about half by 
2050 under the Business -as-Usual scenario and if the current rate of deforestation continues, the world´s forests 
could dissolve within th e next 100 years.  
On the other hand, the high Andes region is home to diverse ecosystems crucial in carbon sequestration and climate 
regulation, such as paramo grasslands, montane cloud forests, and high -altitude wetlands (Peña et al., 2011) . Andean 
forests act as strong sinks for aboveground carbon and have a high potential to serve as future carbon refuges 
(Duque et al., 2021) . As climate change continues to impact these regions, adaptive management strategies that 
can respond to evolving environmental conditions are crucial for the sustainability of these ecosystems and the 
communities that depend on them. For instance, montan e cloud forests in the high Andes, such as those in Manu 
National Park, Peru, are also significant carbon stores. Improved management of these ecosystems can generate 
additional income for rural communities by commercializing carbon credits (Gibbon et al., 2010) . Also, Andean 
peatlands are essential for carbon and nitrogen accumulation. Understanding the factors affecting the accumulation 
of these elements in peatlands is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change on these ecosystems (León and 
Oliván, 2014) . In addition, the Andean plateau contains significant soil organic carbon (SOC) reservoirs, which are 
vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic activities, such as changes in land use and water management 
(Muñoz et al., 2015) . 
The region faces numerous challenges, including land use change, deforestation, and climate change, which affect 
carbon storage and the livelihoods of local communities (Barrera et al., 2012) . Although several projects have been 
implemented to promote environmentally friendly farming practices and soil and water conservation techniques, 
economic development in the Andean region is often hampered by extreme poverty, low agricultural productivit y, 
and limited off -farm opportunities. Exploring sustainable economic opportunities, such as ecotourism and 
sustainable harvesting of non -timber forest products, could provide alternative income sources for local 
communities while contributing to conservat ion efforts.  
Deforestation and land -use change have been significant sources of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in South 
America, with pasture expansion, commercial cropland, and infrastructure development often noted as some of the 
main drivers (De Sy et al., 2015) . While there are policies in place aimed at protecting these ecosystems, challenges 
in implementation and enforcement remain significant. Strengthening governance and institutional capacities is 
crucial for the effective management of these regions. In th e Andean community countries, there is a bidirectional 
relationship between economic growth, consumption of energy, and CO 2 emissions (Koengkan et al., 2018) . To 
ensure the sustainable development and protection of these ecosystems, it is essential to implement effective land 
use policies, promote environmentally friendly practices, and address the economic and social challenges local 
communities face.  
2.1.1  Amazon ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The Amazon is a critical carbon sink in the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation. Its ecosystems, 
including the rainforest, peatlands, mangroves, and transitional forests, store substantial carbon. These ecosystems 
are essential for optimizing  conservation efforts and maintaining global climate stability.  
The Amazon rainforest has been a long -term net biomass sink, although the rate of carbon accumulation has 
decreased over recent decades (Brienen et al., 2015) . Rödig et al. (2018)  found that the Amazon rainforest gains 
0.56 GtC per year, driven by a mean gross primary productivity (GPP) of 25.1 tC ha-1 a-1 and a mean woody 
aboveground net primary productivity (wANPP) of 4.2 tC ha-1 a-1. The study also found that forest structure and 
successional states are essential factors in the relationship between productivity and biomass, highlighting the need 
for forest management strategies that consider these aspects.  
Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, but human disturbances, such as selective logging, 
understory fires, and habitat fragmentation, affect carbon stocks and emissions. Disturbed forests store 40% less 
aboveground carbon on average compar ed to undisturbed forests and are structurally similar to secondary forests. 
Carbon emissions from these disturbances are significant and could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from 
deforestation in the Amazon (Berenguer et al., 2014) . 
Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests in the tropics, contributing disproportionately to the 
carbon sequestration (Alongi, 2014) . The Brazilian Amazon has one of the largest areas of mangroves in the world, 
Page 8:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  7 
 storing substantial amounts of carbon. The mean ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves east of the Amazon River 
ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha-1, with the Amazon mangroves storing over twice the amount of carbon than upland 
evergreen forests and almost ten times the amount found in tropical dry forests (Kauffman et al., 2018) . However, 
potential carbon losses due to deforestation are of immediate concern, with rates greater than these ecosystems' 
carbon storage (Alongi, 2014) . 
The dry transitional forests in southern Amazonia have received less attention but represent important carbon -
cycling ecosystems (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . These forests exhibit higher leaf photosynthesis and total GPP 
due to drier soil conditions favoring dry deciduous tree species. Carbon allocation patterns are similar to those in 
wetter humid forests, with the dry forests of southern Amazonia acting as a scaled -down version of their humid 
counterparts (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . 
Amazonian peatlands store significant amounts of carbon, with tropical peatlands accounting for about half of the 
global peatland emitted carbon (Ribeiro et al., 2021) . For instance, the Amazon's Pastaza -Marañón Foreland Basin 
(PMFB) is among the largest known intact tropical peatland landscapes globally and is considered highly threatened 
due to human activities such as deforestation and agricultural expansion (Roucoux et al., 2017) . Peatlands in 
Amazonian Peru cover 35,600 ± 2133 km2 and contain 3.14 (0.44 -8.15) Pg C. Peatland pole forests, in particular, are 
identified as the most carbon -dense ecosystem in Amazonia (1391 ± 710 Mg C ha-1) (Draper et al., 2014) . Swindles 
(2018)  reported that the Aucayacu peatland in the PMFB is the oldest peatland in Amazonia, accumulating peat up 
to 7.5 meters deep in approximately 8,900 years.  
These ecosystems face various threats, including deforestation, agricultural expansion, and climate change. The 
preservation of these ecosystems is not only crucial for carbon sequestration but also for maintaining biodiversity 
and supporting local communi ties. It is crucial to protect these ecosystems and support their role as carbon sinks to 
maintain global climate stability and ensure the success of the Paris Climate Agreement (Walker et al., 2020) . 
Peruvian amazon has several concrete examples of ecosystems that play a key role in mitigating climate change by 
acting as carbon sinks such as palm swamp peatlands and high -altitude grasslands. Understanding their carbon 
storage and dynamics is essential for developing effective conservation and restoration policies (Guerrero -Palomino 
et al., 2022; Hastie et al., 2022; Mu ñoz et al., 2015) . 
Amazon palm swamp peatlands are major carbon sinks and reservoirs, storing significant amounts of carbon 
alongside Andean forests with a strong carbon sink capacity (0.67 ± 0.08 Mg C ha−1 y−1)  (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque 
et al., 2021) . However, these ecosystems are threatened due to deforestation and land -use changes, with the 
Peruvian Amazon losing around 190,000 hectares of forest in 2020 alone (Dourojeanni, 2022) . The ongoing 
degradation of these ecosystems can potentially disrupt peat accretion and reduce carbon stocks, emphasizing the 
need for sustainable management and protection (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque et al., 2021) . 
2.1.2  Andean ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The High Andean ecosystems, such as wetlands, forests, grasslands, and the paramo, puna, and southern Andean 
steppe habitats, are characterized by unique environmental conditions and diverse flora and fauna that contribute 
to various ecosystem services, in cluding carbon accumulation and sequestration (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; 
Arroyo and Cavieres, 2013) . These ecosystems play a critical role in mitigating climate change by storing significant 
amounts of carbon in aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and organic soil (Gibbon et al., 2010; Segnini 
et al., 2011) .  
High Andean wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other habitats are known for their substantial carbon storage 
capacity due to their low decomposition rates, which result from flooded soils, low temperatures, and low soil pH 
(Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Mu ñoz et al., 2015; Oliveras et al., 2014) . Research has shown that these ecosystems store 
significant amounts of carbon in aboveground and belowground biomass, as well as in organic soil, with the latter 
accounting for the highest carbon storage (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Girardin et al., 2014; V ásquez et al., 2014) . In a 
study centered on the cloud forest -grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru, Gibbon et al. 
(2010)  found that the puna grasslands stored 7.5 ± 0.7 Mg C ha-1 in aboveground biomass, while the forest near the 
treeline contained 63.4 ± 5.2 Mg C ha-1 aboveground and an additional 13.9 ± 2.8 Mg C ha-1 in the coarse roots.  
Page 9:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  8 
 The unique environmental conditions of the High Andean ecosystems, such as cold and wet climate, low 
atmospheric pressure, and low soil pH, contribute to the accumulation of organic matter and carbon storage (Muñoz 
et al., 2015, 2013) . Organic matter decomposes very slowly in these conditions, and its content increases with altitude. 
Approximately 40 -60% of the soil organic carbon (OC) exists within the top 20 -cm layer, with a high C/N ratio in the 
Andean highlands indicating intense h umification (Muñoz et al., 2015) . Segnini et al . (2011)  determined carbon 
contents and carbon stocks in five Peruvian agroecologies along a 1,000 km transect and found that soils in the 
tropical highland rainforest site had the highest carbon contents (134 g kg -1 [13.4%]) and that diversified production 
systems with crops and livestock were more stable for carbon stocks.  
Human activities, such as grazing, burning, and land use changes, can negatively impact the carbon storage capacity 
of high Andean ecosystems and their biodiversity (Muñoz et al., 2013; Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . These 
disturbances can reduce the net primary productivity (NPP) of the puna grasslands and result in the loss of grasslands 
and montane forests due to agriculture and other land use changes (Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . 
Consequently, it is essential to implement strategies to protect these ecosystems and their essential functions, 
including their roles as stable carbon reservoirs and habitats for threatened species.  
The tropical montane forest ecosystems of the Peruvian Andes are under threat from climate change, which is 
expected to have a high potential impact on 58% of all montane forests, particularly in the elevation range between 
800 and 1200 m.a.s.l (Bax et al., 2021) . Moreover, about 64% of montane forests in protected areas will be exposed 
to high potential impact. Enhancing the adaptive capacity of these ecosystems through restorative and preventive 
conservation measures, such as improving forest functions and mitig ating deforestation and forest degradation 
pressures, is crucial for their survival (Bax et al., 2021) . 
Andean peatlands, particularly those formed by cushion plants, and high -altitude grasslands in the Andean plateau, 
such as the puna, are vital carbon sinks in Peru. These peatlands and grasslands are influenced by climate change 
and human activities, such as grazing, ditching, and unsuitable water management, which alter hydrologic 
conditions and degrade these essential carbon reservoirs (Muñoz et al., 2015; Planas -Clarke et al., 2020) . Hydrologic 
restoration, such as rewetting of moderately drained peatlands, could help moderate climate change's impacts on 
Andean peatlands and increase their ability to store carbon (Planas -Clarke et al., 2020)  
2.2 Vulnerability to climate change in Peru  
Climate change poses significant risks to Peru, making the country highly vulnerable to food insecurity, floods, 
landslides, water scarcity, vector -borne diseases, coastal risks, and systemic failures due to cascading impacts of 
hazards and epidemics, amon g others (Hagen et al., 2022) . Inequities in water governance and changes in the 
hydrology of Peru due to glacial retreat are magnifying vulnerabilities in communities, food producers, and poor 
urban neighbourhoods  (Lynch, 2012) . These challenges underscore the need for comprehensive and inclusive 
approaches to water management and climate adaptation strategies. Various adaptation measures have been 
identified to address these risks, but the low adaptive capacity and climate chan ge may limit their effectiveness 
(Hagen et al., 2022) . Furthermore, there is a need for increased investment in building adaptive capacities at local 
and national levels to enhance resilience against climate change. Additionally, adaptation strategies have limited 
attention, which is insufficient for the cou ntry (Takahashi and Meisner, 2012) . 
Climate change affects the food systems in Peru, with implications for agricultural production, food security, and the 
livelihoods of smallholder farmers (Lozano -Povis et al., 2021; Tito et al., 2018) . The Andean region is highly 
vulnerable to climate change, with increased rainfall intensity, soil erosion, retreat of glaciers, and loss of vegetation 
cover, all impacting crop dynamics. Innovative agricultural practices and technologies, such as climate -smart 
agriculture, are essential to adapt to these changing conditions.  In this regard, Peru's food production and crop 
yields are also negatively affected, especially for crops such as quinoa, potatoes, and tarwi (Lozano -Povis et al., 
2021) . 
One of the primary challenges to Peru's food systems is ensuring adequate food production and security in the face 
of climate change. Rising temperatures can lead to declining crop yields, forcing farmers to change cultivation 
practices or relocate their c rops to higher elevations. However, such changes may also result in the introduction of 
novel pests and a decline in crop quality and value, leading to severe economic losses for local farmers and food 
insecurity (Tito et al., 2018) .

 2.2.1  Climate -related hazard for the Andes and Amazon  
The climate -related hazards in Peru pose significant threats to the diverse environments, ranging from coastal 
deserts to high Andean mountains and humid Amazon lowlands (Young and Le ón, 2009) . Population growth and urban 
expansion increase the vulnerability of communities to these hazards, which include floods, landslides, glacial 
retreat, and extreme weather events (Oliver -Smith, 2014; Vil ímek et al., 2005) . 
El Niño events are one of the primary climate -related hazards in Peru, causing intense rainfall, ponding water, flash 
floods, and landslides, leading to significant damage to society (Brill et al., 2020) . Damage modelling  based on data -
mining methods and remote sensing products, are some tools used in risk assessments. The integration of these 
advanced technologies with traditional knowledge systems can enhance the accuracy and relevance of risk 
assessments. Also, the topo graphic wetness index and the slope length and steepness factor are crucial features in 
classifying damage from compound natural hazards like El Niño events (Brill et al., 2020) . 
On the other hand, glacier retreat in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range has led to the formation of glacial lakes, 
posing a risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) (Vilímek et al., 2014) . GLOFs are closely connected with dynamic 
slope movements, such as ice - and rock -falls and landslides of steep moraine slopes, accounting for around 80% of 
GLOFs in the region. These outburst floods can lead to highly hazardous debris and mudflows, signif icantly 
impacting the high mountainous environment (Vilímek et al., 2014) . Despite efforts by a Peruvian glaciology and lakes 
security office, glacier disasters killed nearly 30,000 people in five glacier -related disasters in Peru´s Cordillera 
Blanca from 1941 to 1970 (Carey, 2005) . A lack of trust between local communities and government officials has 
exacerbated the problem, where many residents live in hazard zones.  
Andean populations are vulnerable to climate change and disasters due to poverty, food insecurity, poor health, 
and marginalization. According to Oliver -Smith (2014) , to address these vulnerabilities, adaptation policies must 
integrate measures to reduce specific hazards with programs aimed at reducing systemic vulnerabilities and societal 
inequality. This approach should include empowering local communities and ensur ing their active participation in 
decision -making processes.  
Addressing climate -related hazards in Peru requires a better understanding and integration of scientific knowledge 
and local expertise (Salzmann et al., 2009) . For example, physically -based numerical models can help simulate

Background 
•The Mekong Delta is the ‘food basket’ of Vietnam, 
home to 18 million people producing food for more 
than 145 million people in Asia, and it is also one of 
the world’s most vulnerable regions to climate change 
and extreme weather events including sea-level rise, 
salinity intrusion, drought, and floods. 
•Alternative land use (e.g., the transition from rice to 
rice-shrimp/shrimp) or alternative labor use (e.g., 
off-farm activities and out-migration) are among the 
climate adaptation strategies 
Page 3:
Background 
•The transition between rice and shrimp needs to be 
implemented at community level, and decision is 
usually made based on majority. 
•Conflicts over natural resources may emerge as part of 
these transitions (e.g., rice vs shrimp farmers) 
•Literature have shown that inequality, fear and 
competition for resources can lead to conflict 
=> The study use lab-in-the-field experiment to explore 
farmer’s conflict and cooperation behaviors related to 
land use transition 
Page 4:
Research questions 
•How do farmer’s lack of decision-making power affect their conflict and cooperation 
behaviors? 
•How do farmer’s opportunity cost affect their conflict and cooperation behaviors? 
Page 5:
Conceptual Framework 
•According to Fehr and Schmidt (1990), inequality 
negatively affects utility (Equation 1) 
•We adapted the theory by: 
- Step 1: Adding Agency A: decision-making power can 
play a role (Equation 2) 
- Step 2: Adding Potential payoff X: opportunity cost can 
be an important factor as well (Equation 3) adding Agency (A) 
adding Opportunity cost (X) 
Page 6:
Hypotheses 
•H1: Farmers without agency (decision-making power) are more likely to behave spitefully and 
less likely to cooperate  
•H2: Farmers facing higher opportunity cost are more likely to behave spitefully and less likely to 
cooperate

Conclusions and implications 
•The result suggests that farmers without decision-making

Page 14:
Conclusions and implications 
•Lab-in-the-ﬁeld experiments can help gain insights into the 
attitudes and behaviors of farmers 
•Land use planning for climate adaptation need to involve 
empowering farmers to make informed decisions about their 
land use practices 
•Policymakers should aim for equitable resource allocation in 
adaptation policies to minimize the perceived opportunity 
costs. This can include ensuring fair access to resources like 
land, water, or ﬁnancial support for all affected parties, thereby 
reducing conﬂicts over resource scarcity.
