"37","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

Small farms are responsible for 80% of world food production, making them key to addressing looming global food shortages (Lowder et al., 2016). Small farms in developing countries navigate a myriad of challenges, including access to information, quality inputs, capital, markets, and among others, land (FAO, 2014). These challenges can be exacerbated for women and other marginalized groups of people due to social normatives within their communities (Petesch, Badstue, & Prain, 2018; Polar et al., 2017; Rola‐Rubzen et al., 2020). Inclusive innovation to address agriculture productivity and loss gaps is tantamount to equitable global food security (FAO, 2014; FAO, 2011). However, many innovations still fail to help stimulate disruption in gender or social inequities, and some even do additional harm. Increasing use of an innovation, referred to as ‘scaling,' is critical to impact at a community or regional level, and is often seen as necessary to support Agriculture Research for Development (AR4D) outcomes (Sartas et al., 2020). Several scaling support tools and methodologies have been developed to assist researchers and practitioners in scaling processes. However, little practical attention has been given to the specific cross-section of gender and relevant diversity within scaling tools and methodologies. This narrative literature review begins to address this by answering: 1) What are unique gender considerations when scaling agricultural innovations?; and 2) What are appropriate methods and approaches for collecting data on these unique gender considerations? Our review finds six points of attention to reflect upon unique gender considerations when innovating and scaling innovation: i) Comprising research and project teams, ii) Designing agricultural innovations, iii) Communicating and extension of innovation, iv) Choosing scale models: entrepreneurship and business development, v) Reinventing and changing technology, and vi) Engaging with the political economy of innovation. Methods to collect necessary data to accurately reflect on these considerations and avoid unintended negative consequences for more gender responsible scaling are also presented. Finally, the literature review is situated in a perspective that more attention should be given to agricultural innovation and scaling support tools and methodologies to address gender or socially marginalized groups.

The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT has extensive experience in using seasonal climate forecasts to improve the management of annual crops (e.g., variety selection, planting time, etc.), but there is limited experience with perennial cropping systems such as cocoa. To this end, we aim to understand which management decisions can benefit from seasonal climate forecasts, which climate variables would require good forecasting skills, and how forecasts need to be translated and communicated to end- users. To achieve this goal, the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT is applying human-centered design (HCD), a creative and participatory approach to problem-solving that allows for a deep understanding of the people for whom we design and the environments in which they live. Stakeholders are considered co-designers in the process of creating solutions or tools, whether digital or non-digital.

3 CGIAR IPSR Innovation Portfolio Management | CGIAR Regional Integrated Initiative for Diversification in East and Southern Africa (Ukama Ustawi)INNOVATION TYPOLOGIES
CGIAR and partners work on a broad variety of innovations to achieve outcomes and impact. These include (1) 
technologies (e.g. germplasm; management practices; machines; data systems), (2) capacity development innovations 
(e.g. training programs; guidelines, e-learning courses), and (3) policy, organizational or institutional innovations 
(governance frameworks, business models, finance mechanisms).
The nature of the innovations and innovation processes may be different. Incremental innovations follow a steady 
process of gradual improvement. Radical innovations replace existing technologies, practices and institutions. 
Disruptive innovations trigger major system reconfiguration or transformation.
The below graphs provide an overview of the innovation type and nature in this portfolio.seal-question

1INNOVATION GEOFOCUSINNOVATION TYPOLOGIES
CGIAR and partners work on a broad variety of innovations to achieve outcomes and impact. These include (1) 
technologies (e.g. germplasm; management practices; machines; data systems), (2) capacity development innovations 
(e.g. training programs; guidelines, e-learning courses), and (3) policy, organizational or institutional innovations 
(governance frameworks, business models, finance mechanisms).
The nature of the innovations and innovation processes may be different. Incremental innovations follow a steady 
process of gradual improvement. Radical innovations replace existing technologies, practices and institutions. 
Disruptive innovations trigger major system reconfiguration or transformation.

"5365","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

 Introduction  
Background 
This report summarizes findings from the project “Agroecological transitions for building resilient and 
inclusive agricultural and food systems (TRANSITIONS)” which is funded by the European Commission 
through its Development of Smart Innovation through Research in Agriculture (DeSIRA) initiative and 
managed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Digital Tools regional work 
in Vietnam focused on research and engagement with digital tools for technical advice and performance 
assessment in sustainable rice production in the Mekong River Delta due to the high climate change 
impacts, climate change mitigation potentials and sustainability challenges.  
Methodology  
This report focused on the learnings from 2 field studies. The first conducted in September 2022 in Can 
Tho province in the Mekong Delta with 24 farmers and extension agents. The digital tool tested was a 
prototype created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for 
rice farmers. The second conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta on SRP farming 
practices and digital tool use. Data was collected in March 2023, through FGDs with 20 farmers and 5 
field agents. The digital tool tested was a prototype created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is 
designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of GHG emissions.   
The purpose of the FGDs was to: 
 Discuss the support that farmers receive in terms of sources of information/guidance and 
performance assessment in rice production. 
 Discuss how farmers use digital tools to improve, monitor, and evaluate their SRP farming practices.

Farmers’ agroecology practices and sources of technical advice/performance 
assessment 
Non-contracted farmers cultivate rice in three cropping seasons thus, they do not cultivate other crops 
besides rice. They want to decrease to two rice cropping seasons since there is limited profit. It will 
require local government support to convert from three cropping seasons to two cropping seasons. 
Some contracted farmers diversify to other crops besides rice in order to increase their income. They 
cultivate fruit trees like durian, jackfruit, and longan in Thoi Lai and Co Do districts.   
Farmers use a number of methods to improve input use efficiency. This includes the use of the Three 
Reductions, Three Gains (3R3G) approach and One Must Do, 5 Reductions (1M5R) which are both 
government programmes to decrease seed, fertilizer, and pesticide input use. Contracted farmers plant 
their rice based on the recommended schedule of the local government. They use sowing with drum 
seeders or mechanized transplanting, spraying is done by drone, and they use a combine harvester to 
harvest the crop. They also implement ecological engineering for pest management in rice crops such as 
planting nectar-rich flower plants on the bunds surrounding rice fields. They apply the alternate wetting 
and drying (AWD) technique for water management and monitor the water level using water tubes. The 
contracting companies require farmers to use high-quality certified seeds, reduce fertilizers and 
pesticides, refrain from pumping water into fields, and use pesticides 20 days before harvest. The 
application of new measures/technologies are done in agreement with the company and the company 
provides training for farmers. The contracted companies pay an additional 200 VND/kg for rice. 
Contracted farmers access information through training courses, demonstration models, field visits from 
extension staff, television, communications via Zalo, Facebook (i.e. to inform each other in case of pests 
or diseases), Agricultural forecast bulletin (CIAT), MobiAgri application, and previous experiences. 
Non-contracted farmers are beginning to use improved methodologies. They use a reduced seed rate 
with 10-15kg/1300m2 (around 80-120kg/ha). They also use certified seeds, reduce chemical fertilisers 
and increase use of organic fertilizers. They are also reducing the number of seasonal pesticide sprayings 
from 5-6 times to 2-3 times as well as not using pesticides during the first 40 days after sowing. They are 
influenced by market requirements, application of new technologies by neighbouring farmers, concerns 
Page 9:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 for environmental impacts, and their desire to reduce input costs. They receive most of the technical 
advice through demonstration models, training classes, television, and talking with other farmers. 
In general, farmers find local agricultural field agents and company field agents the most reliable sources 
of information, followed by experienced fellow farmers and rice buyers. The preferred methods of 
advisory include regular field visits and face-to-face meetings where field agents are able to observe the 
field and provide accurate responses. Farmers and field agents usually use instant messaging methods 
such as Zalo for exchanging of information. Official weekly reports are made in written form. 
Testing of Agritask mobile application 
The digital tool tested during the first field testing in Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta was a prototype 
created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for rice farmers. 
The system is designed for use by both men and women. It is expected to improve efficiency in the data 
collection process whilst simplifying the process for farmers and reducing errors. With time, it is hoped 
that the tool will be used for SRP certification. The current business model is designed on the 
mechanism of paying farmers to use, since rice farmers do not display a strong desire to use digital tools 
to facilitate the data collection process. Farmers expect that this process should be facilitated by field 
agents as such, it will be important for Agritask to think about whether there is scalability in this 
approach. A more scalable approach would be to target field agents as the end users and as such 
developing a tool suitable for their needs. 
The farmers and field agents considered the Agritask application to be useful for the recording of 
farming practices and a more convenient approach than using pen and paper recording. The information 
is structured well and arranged logically. It is considered to have generally user-friendly interfaces. The 
pest and disease recommendations are useful and there are calculations of cost and profit, enabling 
comparison between seasons. 
Suggestions for improvement 
It was considered very important that farmers are able to extract and share the data that they have 
entered. There were a number of recommendations to reduce the rate of errors. It was recommended 
to allow farmers to edit data retrospectively in case of errors while recording. Allowing duplication of 
records where practices do not change over time can reduce errors for example, area or type and 
Page 10:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 volume of pesticides. Duplication of some entry points can also save a significant amount of time. It was 
suggested that a reminder warning be included if a user forgets to input data (according to an 
established frequency such as daily or weekly or a few times per week) similarly pest/disease warning 
were considered to be useful. Award points could encourage farmers to use frequently. 
Some more specific recommendations are: 
 Use of digit separators (. ,) 
 Charts of farming results (cost, yield, revenue, profit, etc.) to compare with the same season across 
different years. 
 The app currently does not allow saving data for the current day. It only allows saving for dates up 
to the date before the current date. Sometimes farmers use lunar calendar for crop establishment, 
it would be good if the app can show both lunar and solar calendars. 
 Machinery cost should be broken down to specific items such as land preparation, tillage/ploughing, 
sowing, etc.  
 Allow users to add items not available in the pre-designed lists of fertilisers and pesticides (some 
common fertilisers such as urea, DAP, Kali NPK 16-16-8, NPK 20-20-15 are not in the list). Under pest 
management: mouse management is missing. 
 Labour cost can be VND/day and can sometimes be a lump sum cost (not determined by labour 
day), so the app should allow to record labour cost by area (i.e. ha or season). 
 The area unit varies between provinces. While farmers in one province are familiar with ha, those in 
other provinces are more familiar with “big cong” (equivalent to 1296m2). 
 Farmers are confused among units of fertilizer (the way of inputting is not friendly to them) and the 
units for pesticide were too limiting. Some people would prefer litres, while others prefer bottles or 
other units.  
 The app’s error alerts were confusing to farmers, sometimes the alerts were in English even though 
the device system language and the app language were both in Vietnamese.

SRP management 
Rikolto launched their SRP project in Dong Thap 2018 with implementation of the model commencing at 
the end of 2019. By 2020, the program had been scaled up to involve approximately 800 small holder 
farmers across eight cooperatives, covering a total of 2,000-3,000 hectares of land. 
Scoring occurs once per crop season, typically at the end of the season. Agents visit farmers weekly to 
monitor progress, assess the current situation, and take notes for a summary report. The process to 
input farming data for SRP monitoring and scoring takes approximately two hours per SRP farmer. At the 
time of survey, SRP scoring was done by technicians in the local areas who had been trained in SRP in 
cooperation with the cooperatives; most farmers who joined this program reached 80% and above. 
There was a plan that Rikolto would hire an independent body to perform the scoring in 2023 with the 
expectation of selling rice at a higher price. 
Agents maintain records of each SRP farmer's name, rice area, field address, and phone number on hard 
copy documents. The SRP project provides agents an Excel form for scoring. SRP farmers keep record of 
farming diaries using a notebook provided by the project. The rice management diary includes 
information on seed varieties, fertilizer usage, harvesting practices, labour costs, yields, prices, and 
productivity. At the end of the season, these diaries are collected by field agents to input into a digital 
format (normally Excel) for scoring.  
It was reported that production cost reduced up to 30% per season. Currently, there is no contract 
farming scheme for SRP rice under this project. Farmers sell rice either to companies under the 
cooperatives’ on-going contracts or to middlemen. SRP rice under this project is sold at prices that are 
100-200 VND/kg higher than market prices for regular rice; the difference comes from negotiation based 
on improved quality (i.e., use of certified seeds and reduced chemical use). Some farmers indicated that 
after completing the pilot project, they would continue to implement the SRP techniques due to the 
financial benefits from saving input costs and health benefits for farmers. Some farmers shared that 
they would continue the model if the rice is certified and sold at considerably higher prices.

 In general, all famers apply AWD. Even during the wet season (Autumn – Winter), sometimes water is 
pumped out of the field to prevent logging. Farms use certified pesticides and apply integrated pest 
management practices to control pesticide use. Straw is generally incorporated before wet seasons and 
collected and sold during dry seasons. Straw is sold for production of mushroom, ornamental plants and 
flowers or compost.

Challenges faced by field agents while using digital tools  
Data is collected by field agents in pen and paper form in the field. When the agents return to their 
office this data is transcribed on to Excel. The software does not have all the statistical functions 
needed, and agents must use additional software like SPSS for further analysis. Additionally, it takes 
time to enter information from the notebook to Excel while doing SRP scoring. 
Communication tools such as Zalo are commonly used by field agents to communicate with farmers. 
Google maps is sometimes used by field agents however, it doesn’t meet the resolution needs to meet 
the requirements of users/officers in monitoring rice growth stages and pest detection. 
Field agents expressed an interest in using an app and transferring the notebook/diary to manage online 
by an application to save time, ensure consistency, and provide convenience. There was the suggestion 
of integrating the scoring function into the app so that farmers can enter data themselves under the 
support of field agents.  
Testing of CropPal mobile application 
The second field testing conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta tested a prototype 
created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of 
Page 13:

 GHG emissions. They are still in the process of developing a sustainable business model. They are 
proposing the app be pay for use by farmers or supported by financial institutions. It will be important to 
develop a long term scalable business model. One approach could be to design the app for use by public 
sector and private sector field agents, who work directly with farmers for SRP certification.  
Field agents considered CropPal to be generally convenient, accessible, and suitable for users/farmers. 
They liked the ability of CropPal to retain information.  It was suggested that a reminder warning be 
included for incomplete information in each section and there be a function to review the history of 
entered information. It was requested that there be a function to export outputs to Excel. It was 
proposed the design of a season management section by year. 
Interface 
Farmers struggled to interpret the icons. It was suggested that changing the icons to text or 
photographic images that are familiar to farmers which would make the buttons more easily 
recognisable. Farmers also preferred to have each button in its own distinctive colour. Vietnamese 
needs to be used as the primary language throughout the app. 
Field agents had a preference for use of kg unit instead of “bag” unit. Field agents suggested changing 
from drop down options to a blank space which allows flexibility of answer. List all fertilizer categories 
and leave the corresponding quantity blank for users. They suggested changing the way to log in to 
CropPal, using the user's phone number to get the number code automatically, which is only required 
the first time using the app. The app could then be managed by the field agents using farmer code. 
Functions 
It was recommended that the application include more statistical functions on varieties e.g. variety type, 
quantity/area of sowing). They would like additional functions for productivity and information about 
expenses for fertilizers, and labour costs. The definition of the duration of each rice variety should be 
adjusted as follows: Short-term rice (85-90 days), medium-term rice (95 days), long-term rice (>110 
days). Pest detection time needs to be included (dd/mm)

Conservation agriculture for regenerating soil health and climate change mitigation in smallholder systems of South Asia The increase in agriculture production to meet the food demand of growing human population from a limited availability of arable land with low environmental footprints and preserving natural resources (soil, water and air) simultaneously are major challenges in South Asia. The situation is further complicated by the climate change, which will further lower the food production, compounding the challenge of meeting food demand. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is solution to several challenges being faced in farming such as soil health, climate change, water scarcity, agricultural pollution, farm profitability, human health, etc. This exhaustive review examines the published literature from South Asia to assess the impact of CA on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the subsequent impacts on soil health (physical, chemical and biological properties), C sequestration and greenhouse gases emissions in major cropping systems. The results from several studies demonstrated that CA increased SOC and improved soil health parameters, mainly in the surface soil layer. The effects of CA on the changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity are small. The CA showed a remarkable positive impact on the nutrient availability in the soil. The CA system helped in both climate change mitigation and adaptation for sustainable crop production. The present gaps in our knowledge in soil health assessment and research agenda to fill the gaps are also included in this chapter. We hope this review of past accomplishments, current activities, and future opportunities will stimulate additional soil health research throughout the 21st century. Chapter Three.

The objectives of this study were to develop a precision SPVD phenotyping protocol, to find new SPVD-resistant genotypes, and to standardize the first stages of screening for SPVD resistance. The first part of the protocol was based on ELISA results for sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and sweet potato virus C (SPVC) with adjustments to a negative control (uninfected clone 'Tanzania') and was performed on a pre-breeding population (VZ08) comprising 455 clones and 27 check clones graft-inoculated under screenhouse conditions. The second part included field studies with 52 selected clones for SPCSV resistance from VZ08 and eight checks. In screenhouse conditions, the resistant and susceptible check clones performed as expected, 63 clones from VZ08 exhibited lower relative absorbance values for SPCSV and SPVC than inoculated check Tanzania. Field experiments confirmed SPVD resistance of several clones selected by relative absorbance values (nine resistant clones in two locations, i.e. 17.3% of the screenhouse selection), supporting the reliability of our method for SPVD-resistance selection. Two clones were promising, exhibiting high storage root yields of 28.7-34.9 t ha-1 and SPVD resistance, based on the proposed selection procedure. This modified serological analysis for SPVD-resistance phenotyping might lead to more efficient development of resistant varieties by reducing costs and time at early stages, and provide solid data for marker assisted selection with a quantitative tool for classifying resistance.

The intervention included a variety of strategies designed to improve: (1) the affordability through a coupon system; (2) the acceptability through a promotional campaign about the importance of eating fruits and vegetables every day; and (3) a combination of both through a loyalty card system and improvements in point of sales, product display, marketing, delivery of nutritional information to consumers, food safety, and customer service practices. The bundled intervention was implemented over twelve months and led to a marginal increase in the proportion of females consuming fruits and vegetables during the intervention period in both countries.

Low fruit and vegetable (FV) intake in low- and middle-income countries, which is associated with noncommunicable diseases and micronutrient deficiencies, requires food system interventions addressing FV accessibility, affordability, and acceptability. Periodic FV intake monitoring during interventions informs progress toward achieving increased intakes and contributes to understanding the effectiveness of these interventions. Objectives
This study evaluates the trend in FV intake before, during, and after implementation of a set of nutrition-sensitive food system interventions addressing accessibility, affordability, and acceptability to increase FV consumption over a 1-y period in Vietnamese and Nigerian low-income urban and periurban females. Methods
We used the Diet Quality Questionnaire to assess FV food group consumption among 600 Vietnamese (Hanoi) and 610 Nigerian (Ibadan) females before, during, and after the interventions (Vietnam: July 2020–September 2021; Nigeria: November 2020–December 2021). A FV score was compared between exposure groups with (mixed) count modeling. The trend in consumption of individual FV groups was analyzed with mixed logistic regression. Results
The FV score was stable over time, and a small increase was observed after the intervention period especially in Nigeria and in urban Vietnam. A decrease in the total score was observed in periurban Vietnam. Fluctuations were detected in the probability of consumption of individual FV groups over time especially within the fruit groups, probably due to seasonal availability. The degree of exposure could not explain differences in FV intake. Conclusions
We found a marginal increase in the proportion of females consuming FV during the interventions in both countries. The FV score appeared to be a simple, quick, and easy-to-use indicator for monitoring diversity, variety, and consumption.

This project seeks to comprehend historical messaging patterns and their correlation with climate 
hazard data from livestock farmers' current interactions with agriculture service provider platforms 
like iShamba. The goal is to develop a high -resolution, targeted, and timely advisory package for 
livestock far mers through these platforms. The dataset comprises 319,569 records of text 
messages sent by farmers via the iShamba platform between 2015 and 2022. After data pre -
processing, including filtering for livestock -specific messages and removing duplicate SMS 
messages, the final sample size is 72,062, with no missing data.  
 
Recognizing the impact of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) on livestock 
productivity, the analysis employs the Structural Topic Model (STM) package in R. This tool 
explores the optimal number of topics for topic modeling, visualizes res ults, estimates relationships 
between metadata and topics, creates a Shiny application for STM results, and utilizes the Stupid

The results reveal that simplifying THI and NDD stress level classes did not yield expected 
outcomes, especially when compared to the more intricate model of NDD. The intricate model 
successfully identified stress -related words and SMSs. The findings empha size that extreme 
weather conditions, such as prolonged absence of rain for over 25 days in a month, trigger farmer 
concerns about crop health and the impact of pesticides. While the simplified model approach

 Introduction  
 
iShamba, part of MediaE company, is a call centre  staffed by agricultural professionals where 
farmers can SMS in their inquiries or phone in for immediate assistance. Along with the weather 
updates and market prices, iShamba offers Agri -tips on crops and livestock after a farmer signs up. 
Farmers can eit her sign up for free or choose a premium plan for a small fee per year.  
Overview  
 
The Climate Action team's Livestock and Climate Initiative project, led by Scientist Dharani Dhar 
Burra, is interested in understanding historical messaging patterns and their correlation with 
climate hazards data from livestock farmers' current interactio ns with agriculture service provider 
platforms like iShamba. This information will further help to develop a high resolution targeted/ 
timely advisory package for livestock farmers through the service provider platforms.  
Objectives  
 
This project will aim to:  
 
1. Understand current trends/patterns of historical interactions of farmers with the iShamba 
platform.  
2. Identify if there is a pattern between messaging from farmers and climate hazards.  
3. We can then estimate farmers information requirements much ahead of time based on the 
forecasted climate hazards.  
4. This pre -emption of information requirement will then help us build more targeted advisory 
packages for the livestock farmers.  
5. Assess the applicability of the targeted advisories sent to the farmers through surveys.  
Data  
 
This project aims to analyze unstructured data from the iShamba platform, specifically text 
messages sent by farmers between the years 2015 to 2022. The initial plan was to utilize two 
years of data, but after preliminary data processing, many cases were d ropped due to incomplete 
or one -word messages received from the farmers, leading to a significant drop in the number of 
observations.         
 
The dataset received from the iShamba platform for the specified years contains 319,569 records. 
However, after data pre -processing and filtering to include only livestock -specific messages, and 
manually deleting duplicate SMS messages, the final sample si ze for this study is 72,062, with no 
missing data in the dataset.   
 
The variables included in the dataset are Task ID, Customer ID, Date, Time, Description, 
SMS sent by farmers, Responses to SMS, Assignees, Priority, SMS Tags, County, Sub - 
County, Wards, and x and y location points. The analysis will focus on the following  
variables:  
 
Page 4:
 
Page. 4  
 • Date - a character variable recorded by the platform for every farmer's inquiry received. The 
year and month will be extracted to calculate climate hazards later in the analysis.  
• SMS sent by farmers - a character variable containing the text messages received by 
farmers on the iShamba platform.  
• Sub-county - a character variable that records the county location of the farmer.  
• Ward - a character variable that records the sub -county location of the farmer.  
 
The number of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) are both recognized to reduce 
the productivity of livestock. However, the Agriculture Adaptation Atlas does not provide the mean 
number of NDD and THI for the years 2015 -2022. Therefore, bo th climate hazards were computed 
monthly for each year and ward using a projected climate hazards model. This will help to develop 
a relationship between the text messages received by farmers and both climate hazards. The 
overall goal of this relationship is to project future advisories that iShamba can send to livestock 
farmers regarding climate hazards at appropriate time in their location.  
 
Methodology  
 
I.Data Pre -Processing  
 
The data pre -processing for this project was conducted using R, due to the unstructured 
nature of the data. The initial step involved the removal of special characters, numbers, 
brackets, and quotes. This was followed by the separation of the time and date into new 
variables to extract the year and month for calculating the mean climate hazards in later 
analysis.  
 
The third step of the pre -processing included trimming the white spaces between text, 
selecting SMS messages that had a character count of 3 or above, and converting all text to 
lowercase. Additionally, some misspelled words in the SMS sent by farmers colu mn were 
corrected to enhance the accuracy of the subsequent analysis.  
 
A total of 140 wards were missing in the dataset, but their location points X and Y were 
available. To obtain the names of these wards, a join was performed with a Kenya shapefile 
dataset using the X and Y location points. This allowed for the extraction of the missing ward 
names, completing the dataset. Finally, records of counties that were not in Kenya and rows 
with ""NA"" across the county, sub -county, ward, and X and Y location points were dropped. The 
resulting p re-processed dataset had 252,759 observations.  
 
II.Filtering data to livestock  
 
To filter the dataset to focus only on livestock -related queries, a text analysis was performed 
using the ""Tm"" package in R to tokenize the SMS messages into words. A total of 264 words 
were removed, including non -English words and common words that were n ot relevant to the 
analysis. This resulted in a list of 81,114 unique words. The tokenized words list was then 
shared with iShamba to identify livestock -related words, which were flagged as ""high,"" while 
words that were not related to livestock were flagged as ""low."" This process yielded a list of 
Page 5:
 
Page. 5  
 5,956 unique words related to livestock. These words were used to filter the text messages to 
only include those that contained one or more words related to livestock.  
 
This filtering process resulted in a dataset of 78,169 observations. However, to eliminate 
duplicate SMS messages, a manual deletion process was conducted, resulting in a reduced 
dataset of 72,062 observations. A join operation was performed by creating a file containing 
unique IDs of sub -counties and wards, which was then merged with the filtered text data.  
 
To compute the monthly NDD and THI values for each ward, the same computation steps 
used for the development of the global adaptation atlas ( AdaptationAtlas - hazards ) were 
applied. The resulting data was aggregated to obtain average values for each month/year and 
ward. These average values were appended to the iShamba dataset, which contained the 
corresponding month, year, and ward for each SMS message.  
 
To facilitate analysis and interpretation, the NDD and THI values were transformed into new 
binary categorical variables as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl: a character variable defined as1: 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress"" = “yes”,  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”.  
 
• ndd_lvl: a character variable defined as:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress"" = “yes”.  
 
Consequently, the final dataset consists of 72,062 observations and includes six variables: 
SMS (actual) by farmers, month, year, ward, thi_lvl, and ndd_lvl. This filtered dataset was 
used for the subsequent analysis.  
 
III.Analysis  
 
Structural Topic Model (STM) provides a variety of statistical approaches for analyzing text 
data. The STM allows one to discover topics and estimate their relationship to document 
metadata. The  “stm” package in R provides tools to facilitate the workflow associated with 
analyzing textual data and users have a broad array of options to process raw text data, 
explore and analyze the data, and present findings using a variety of plotting tools.  
 
The steps involved in the STM topic prevalence model are as follows:  
 
1. Loading the data in R:  The ""stm"" package represents the text corpus in three parts:  
 
• A documents list containing word indices and their associated counts.  
 
1 The iShamba data has no THI “sever stress” cases.  
Page 6:
 
Page. 6  
 • A vocab character vector containing the words associated with the word indices.  
• A metadata matrix containing document covariates.  
 
2. Applying the ""textProcessor"" function:  This function is used to preprocess the data 
by removing punctuation, eliminating stop words, and stemming the words. It leverages 
the ""tm"" package and can be applied across multiple languages.  
 
3. Using the utility function ""prepDocuments"":  This function processes the loaded 
data to ensure it is in the correct format. It can also remove infrequent terms based on 
a user -set parameter called ""lower.thresh."" Additionally, ""prepDocuments""  will re -
index all metadata and document relationships if any changes occur during the 
processing. If a document is completely removed due to preprocessing (e.g., if it 
contained only rare words), the corresponding row in the metadata will be dropped. It i s 
important to inspect the document features and vocabulary list after reading and 
processing the text data to verify that the preprocessing steps have been applied 
correctly . 
 
These steps are crucial for preparing the data for the subsequent stages of the STM topic 
prevalence model. After the data import process in steps 2 and 3, the text corpus includes of 
71,105 documents and 16,467 tokens.  
 
4. Exploration of Topic Model s: Determining the optimal number of topics for a given 
corpus is not a straightforward task (Grimmer and Stewart 2013). To address this 
challenge, the ""searchK""  function employs a data -driven approach to select the 
appropriate number of topics. This function conducts various automated tests, such as 
calculating the held -out likelihood (Wallach et al. 2009) and performing residual 
analysis (Taddy 2012). By default , the ""Spectral""  initialization method is used due to 
its stability. Additionally, the ""searchK""  function computes several informative metrics, 
including average exclusivity and semantic coherence, to assist in the selection 
process.  
 
5. Estimating the structural topic model (STM):  After determining the optimal number 
of topics, the next crucial step is to estimate the STM. This process involves using 
various functions to assess, comprehend, and visualize the fitted model object. One 
key advantage of STM is its ability to incorporat e metadata into the topic modeling 
framework, enhancing the analysis in two ways:  
 
• topical prevalence:  Metadata covariates for topical prevalence enable the 
observed metadata to influence how frequently a topic is discussed.  
• topical content:  Covariates in topical content allow the observed metadata to 
affect the rate of word usage within a specific topic, shaping how that topic is 
discussed.  
 
When running the STM model, multiple arguments will be used, including the output from the 
prepDocuments  () function, which provides a documents column, a vocab column, and a meta 
column. The number of topics (K) identified using the ""searchK"" function will also be specified. 
Additionally, the ""init.type"" will be set to ""Spectral."" Lastly, the ""prevalence"" a rgument will be  
Page 7:
 
Page. 7  
 utilized to specify the metadata variables of interest as covariates, represented as an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and ""ndd_lvl.""  
 
6. Interpreting STM model results:  Once a suitable model has been chosen, the next 
crucial step involves interpreting the results. There are various methods to explore the 
output and gain insights from the STM model. The stm package provides several 
options to investigate and analyse the m odel's outcomes:  
 
• Displaying words associated with Topics : The “labelTopics”  function, along 
with the plot method for 'STM' objects (with the argument type = ""labels""), and the 
“sageLabels”  function (with the plot method for 'STM' objects, using the argument 
type = ""perspectives""), allow users to view the words closely associated with each 
topic. Additionally, the “findThoughts”  and “plotQuote”  functions are useful for 
identifying documents that have strong associations with specific topics.  
• Estimating relationships between Metadata and Topics:  The “estimateEffect”  
function can be employed to estimate the relationships between metadata 
variables and topics, as well as the topical content. This facilitates understanding 
how certain metadata covariates influence the prevalence and content of different 
topics.  
• Calculating Topic Correlations:  To measure the correlations between different 
topics, the “topicCorr”  function can be utilized, providing valuable insights into 
the relationships between various topics within the model.  
 
7. Shiny Application for inspecting STM results:  The “stminsights”  package in R 
enables interactive validation, interpretation, and visualization of one or several 
Structural Topic Models (STM).  
 
8. Stupid Back -off (SBO) model  – The “sbo” package in R will be used using the N -
gram model to build a predictive model that will take space -time stamp  and stress 
conditions to predict the next word(s).  
Results  
 
I.Determining the number of topics  
 
To identify the optimal number of topics for the analysis, the searchK function from the STM 
package in R will be utilized. This function takes several arguments, including the output from 
the prepDocuments() function. The number of topics (K) will be expl ored in the range of 30 to 
100. Additionally, the ""init.type"" parameter will be set to ""Spectral"" to improve the initialization 
process. Furthermore, the ""prevalence"" argument will be specified, allowing for the inclusion of 
metadata variables as covariate s, represented as an interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and 
""ndd_lvl."" This data -driven approach will help determine the most appropriate number of topics 
to be used by comparing the exclusivity and sematic scores between topics in the subsequent 
analysis.  
 
The results presented in Figure A showcase four key metrics used to assess the model 
quality: held -out likelihood, residual dispersion, topic semantic coherence, and the 
Page 8:
 
Page. 8  
 approximation to the lower -bound of the marginal likelihood. The objective is to maximize the 
held-out likelihood, semantic coherence, and lower -bound while minimizing the dispersion of 
residuals. These metrics collectively aid in determining the most reli able and robust model for 
the analysis.  
 
Figure A: Diagnostic Values for STM Model  (Sequence of Topics 30 -100) 
 
 
 
To evaluate the strength of the modelled topics and choose the appropriate number of topics 
for the analysis, we refer to Figure A.1, which displays a comparison of different STM models 
with varying numbers of topics. Models with K = 30 and K = 40 exhibit a narrower spread of 
topics towards the right side, and both models contain some topics that are considered 
outliers. On the other hand, models with K = 80 and K = 90 show a more favorable spread of 
topics towards the right, indicating a better distribution. Among these models, model 90 stands 
out, as it contains numerous topics with high exclusivity and semantic scores, making it the 
most suitable choice for further analysis.

II.Interpreting the STM by plotting and inspecting res ults 
 
After selecting the appropriate model with the desired number of topics, the next crucial step is 
to interpret the results of the STM model. The ""stm"" package offers several functions to 
explore the model's outcomes effectively. One such approach is to examine collections of 
words associated with each topic using the ""labelTopics"" function. Figure A.2 ill ustrates a 
sample output of the STM model, presenting four types of word weightings:  
 
• Highest Probability : This includes words within each topic with the highest probability, 
directly inferred from the topic -word distribution parameter β.  
• FREX:  Words are weighted based on their overall frequency and their exclusivity to the 
topic.  
• Lift: Words are weighted by dividing their frequency in the current topic by their 
frequency in other topics, giving higher weight to words that appear less frequently in 
other topics.  
• Score:  This weighting divides the log frequency of the word in the current topic by the 
log frequency of the word in other topics.  
 
It is advisable to prioritize using FREX words as they highlight words that carry significant 
weight and are unique to each topic. As evident in Figure A.2, Topic 22 is associated with 
farmers seeking information on grazing and breeds through the iShamba p latform, while Topic 
3 and Topic 47 both lack any coherent association with a specific topic. Additionally, Topic 68 
Page 10:
 
Page. 10  
 discusses harvest -related matters, and Topic 83 focuses on farmers seeking advice and 
assistance from the iShamba platform regarding farming activities.  
 
Figure A .2: Example of the output of STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
 
Another valuable approach is to estimate the relationships between metadata and topics using 
the ""estimateEffect""  function. These relationships play a crucial role in validating the topic 
model's effectiveness (Grimmer 2010; Grimmer and Stewart 2013). This function performs 
regression, treating documents as the units, the proportion of each document about a topic in 
an STM model as the outcome, and document metadata as covariates. The method of 
composition is used to incorporate measurement uncertainty from the STM model. The 
""estimateEffect""  function requires several arguments, including the formula representing an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl""  and "" ndd_lvl"",  the output of the STM model, and the metadata. 
The ""uncertainty""  parameter is set to ""Global""  by default, which considers the estimation 
uncertainty of topic proportions in the uncertainty estimates using the method of composition. 
Alternatively, users can choose ""None""  for uncertainty if they do not wish to propagate the full 
amount of uncertainty, which might result in narrower confidence intervals due to the exclusion 
of additional estimation uncertainty. When calling ""summary"" on the ""estimateEffect""  object, a 
regression table (Roberts, Margaret E., Brandon M. Stewart, and Dustin Tingley 2019) will be 
generated, providing valuable insights into the relationships between metadata and topics.  
 
The proportion of the data that is yes/no from 71,105 observations is as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl  are both “yes” – 26,315 observations.  
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl are both “no” – 4,265 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “yes” and ndd_lvl is “no” – 9,451 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “no” and ndd_lvl is “yes” – 31,074 observations.  
Page 11:
 
Page. 11  
  
Table 1 presents the outcomes derived from the ""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 3, 22, 47, 
68, and 83. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific topic, outlining associated terms, 
their respective estimates, standard errors, and p -values. The i ntercept in the table signifies 
instances where both THI and NDD stress levels are categorized as ""no stress."" Notably, this 
intercept remains statistically significant across all 90 topics.  
 
A broad interpretation of the model suggests that when comparing the intercept, symbolizing 
""no stress,"" to scenarios where THI and NDD indicate stress levels, the model tends to 
generate a list of more generic words and topics. This outcome is likely due to the climate 
conditions being categorized as ""no stress,"" indicating that farmers are less concerned about 
weather's impact on their agricultural activities.  
 
It's important to highlight that the model's output doesn't reveal any terms related to livestock 
or weather, indicating that the model is not performing as expected.  
 
 
      Signif . codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1  
            Intercept here is defined as THI and NDD = “no stress”  
 
To explore the depth of the relationship between SMSs and topics, the ""findThoughts""  function 
is employed. Figure A.3 presents the top five SMSs associated with Topics 3, 22, and 47. 
Observing Figure A.3, it becomes evident that the received SMSs pertain to various queries 
without specific relevance to livestock or livestock feed crops. I t can be inferred that this 
interaction model did not yield the anticipated outcomes, as the associated words with topics

 seemed random and lacked the specificity needed to discern the nature of livestock -related 
inquiries that farmers seek from the iShamba platform.  
 
 
 
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the types of queries sent by 
livestock farmers to the iShamba platform and to enhance the platform's advisory capabilities 
based on the findings from this analysis. The interaction regression model yielded words that 
were associated with the ""no stress"" category. This outcome can be attributed to the simplified 
model, where classes of THI and N DD were simplified, leading the model to recognize words 
related to the ""no stress"" scenario.  
 
Shifting the focus away from the interaction model between THI and NDD, we proceeded to 
conduct separate regression analyses for THI and NDD. To facilitate this, both covariates were 
reverted to their original categorical forms:  
 
• For “ thi”:2 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized  as ""no stress""  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress""  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
 
• For “ndd”:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress""

 • NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress""  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress""  
 
 
Upon a more in-depth analysis of the data, a significant pattern has emerged. SMSs flagged 
with ""mild"" and ""moderate"" stress levels for THI collectively constitute 50.27% of the dataset. 
In contrast, for NDD, SMSs indicated as having ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and ""extreme "" stress 
levels make up a substantial portion, accounting for a total of 80.77% of the data. Notably, THI 
shows no distinct disparity between ""no stress"" and stress levels. Additionally, it's important to 
highlight that the THI data lacks instances of ""sev ere"" stress.  
 
The probability of selecting an SMS labeled with ""no stress"" as compared to stress levels 
labeled ""mild"" or ""moderate"" for THI stands at 50%. Due to this equal distribution, it becomes 
challenging for the THI model to effectively discern stress -related key words.  
 
In contrast, the prevalence of stress levels, encompassing ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and 
""extreme,"" is notably higher with NDD. Stress levels make up 80.77% of the data, whereas ""no 
stress"" levels constitute only 19.23%. Consequently, the NDD model is anticipa ted to 
effectively identify stress -related words and topics. Therefore, the subsequent ""estimateEffect"" 
results concentrate on scenarios where NDD serves as the covariate.  
 
The same STM model logic was applied to the NDD model, but this time the model had only 
one covariate with the four classes of NDD mentioned above. The searchK function was 
executed to determine the appropriate number of topics, and it also yielded K = 90,  indicating 
a more favorable distribution of topics towards the right side. This distribution suggests a 
better overall topic coverage. Figure A.4 below displays the outcomes of the STM model for 
NDD. Notably, this model generated more words that are close ly related to livestock or 
livestock feed.  
 
For instance, the “labelTopics” plot below , Topic 43 delves into crops such as millet, cassava, 
and peas that could be used for feeding livestock. On the other hand, Topic 63 addresses 
pesticide control for crops, which affects the well -being of livestock . Furthermore, Topic 48 
touches upon financial aspects, indicating that farmers might seek loans for their farms or 
intend to purchase more livestock. Meanwhile, Topic 58 addresses farmers' concerns about 
climate change and the prevailing conditions that m ay impact their farming activities in the 
present and future.

 Figure A.4: Example of the output of NDD STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
Table 2, presented below, displays the regression outcomes derived from the NDD 
""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. The intercept within the table signifies 
the context where NDD stress level is classified as ""extreme stress."" Importantly, this intercept 
exhibits statistical significance across all 90 topics.  
 
Interpreting the model's outcomes reveals that for Topics 43 and 63, any incremental 
alteration in NDD stress levels classified as ""extreme stress"" elicits a shift in farmers' concerns 
towards crop -related issues and pesticide control. This alignment is ob servable in Figure A.4.  
 
As NDD conditions become more severe, observed through the significance of ""severe stress"" 
in Topic 58 at a 0.001 significance level, an increase of -0.0010 in NDD stress level appears to 
prompt farmers' apprehensions about climate conditions and their potential impact on farming 
activities. This prompts them to seek guidance from the iShamba platform before conditions 
escalate to the level of “extreme stress”.

To delve further into the intricacies of the relationship between SMSs and topics, Figure A.5 
showcases the top four SMSs associated with Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. It can be observed 
that the SMSs from farmers exhibit a strong correlation with topics related to livestock, climate, 
pesticides, and crops. However, it's important to note that this mo del also generated topics 
with seemingly random and basic words that are not inherently connected to livestock. This 
might be attributed to the presence of noise within the dataset, introducing some level of 
uncertainty.

To explore deeper into the results of the Estimateeffect model, we specifically focused on 
topics where a distinct difference was evident between the intercept (extreme stress) and no 
stress. This analysis led to the identification of approximately 52 such  topics. For each of these 
topics, we utilized the findthoughts function to extract 100 SMSs, resulting in a total of 5200 
observations.  
 
From these 5200 SMSs, we associated them with the corresponding wards by referencing the 
original dataset. Astonishingly, only 83 unique wards were represented out of the total 1450 
wards in the complete dataset.  
 
Further filtering was applied to isolate SMSs inquiring about climate, rain, and weather. This 
refinement resulted in 277 observations. Among these, 82 unique wards were found to have 
sent climate -related queries to the iShamba platform.

The effective and efficient water resource conservation and management necessary to mitigate the crisis requires monitoring data, especially on water quality. This is recognized by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, particularly indicator 6.3.2., which requires all UN member states to measure and report the ‘proportion of water bodies with good ambient water quality’. However, gathering sufficient data on water quality is reliant on data collection at spatial and temporal scales that are generally outside the capacity of institutions using conventional methods. Digital technologies, such as wireless sensor networks and remote sensing, have come to the fore as promising avenues to increase the scope of data collection and reporting. Citizen science (which goes by many names, e.g., participatory science or community-based monitoring) has also been earmarked as a powerful mechanism to improve monitoring. However, both avenues have drawbacks and limitations. The synergy between the strengths of modern technologies and citizen science presents an opportunity to use the best features of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the other. This paper briefly synthesizes recent research illustrating how smartphones, sometimes in conjunction with other sensors, present a nexus point method for citizen scientists to engage with and use sophisticated modern technology for water quality monitoring. This paper also presents a brief, non-exhaustive research synthesis of some examples of current technological upgrades or innovations regarding smartphones in citizen science water quality monitoring in developing countries and how these can assist in objective, comprehensive, and improved data collection, management and reporting. While digital innovations are being rapidly developed worldwide, there remains a paucity of scientific and socioeconomic validation of their suitability and usefulness within citizen science. This perhaps contributes to the fact that the uptake and upscaling of smartphone-assisted citizen science continues to underperform compared to its potential within water resource management and SDG reporting. Ultimately, we recommend that more rigorous scientific research efforts be dedicated to exploring the suitability of digital innovations in citizen science in the context of developing countries and SDG reporting.

1. Background  
Natural  systems are  inherently  complex  webs  of interconnected 
components that encompass environment, ecosystems, and 
numerous earth system processes operating at scales. Human 
activities and their iterations with these systems make them 
more complex leading to several intended and unintended 
consequences with dynamic feedback loops. While these 
complexities have always existed, these have increased due to 
the recent  technological  explosion  (Sargut  and McGrath,  2011). 
As averred by Sargut and McGrath (2011), the complexity has 
gone from something found in large confined systems, such as 
factories  and cities, to remote environments  such as entire river 
basins. The non -linear effects and dynamic feedback loops  from the natural systems and their human interactions are 
making it harder to predict what will happen because they 
interact  in unexpected ways  and are difficult  to manage.  This is 
especially true where reliable data are not easily accessible.  
River basins are complex natural systems where human 
activities imparted profound influence on water, land, 
ecosystems, and climate patterns. There is no doubt that the 
management of the water resources of a basin is a complex 
issue due to the inherent interplay  of the changing environment 
(Bernhardt et al., 2006; Cosgrove and Loucks, 2015; Leb et  al., 
2018; Young and Harshadeep, 2020). River basin ecosystems 
provide  water  resources  for agriculture,  livestock,  and fisheries, 
industry and for domestic use, sustaining the livelihoods of

Figure  1 A simple  representation  of Digital  Twin  (Jones  et al., 2020)  
 
millions  of people  in the region.  Nonetheless,  these  river  basin 
ecosystems are also subject to hydroclimatic extremes, land 
degradation, poor water quality, urbanization and population 
growth. These environmental shifts not only pose a threat to 
the rich biodiversity in river basins but also weaken the 
resilience of local communities to climate change (Fazey et  
al., 2021; Carmen et al, 2022).  
To effectively manage these complex natural systems 
impacted by human activities, there is a need to leverage 
technological advancements such as high -performance 
computing,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  and real-time database 
management  systems.  The DT concept  is an advanced  version 
of traditional Decision Support Systems (DSS) used to 
manage water resources and environmental processes in river 
basin ecosystems. By utilizing new generation sensors, big 
data, cloud processing and AI, a digital representation of the 
river basin is created, providing a dynamic framework that 
offers comprehensive information for effective management.  
A DT is a rapidly emerging concept that digitally depicts an 
object, a process, or a system (Grieves, 2014; Ademenko et  
al., 2020 and references therein). Grieves and Vickers (2004) 
pioneered the work of DT and presented a DT framework as 
comprising three components, a physical object, a digital 
representation of that object, and the bi -directional data 
connections that feed data from the physical to the digital 
representation, and information and processes from  the digital 
representation  to the physical  (Figure  1). DT has the capability 
of accelerating innovation (e.g., improved modelling of  
system changes or optimized business supply chains) if 
coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT) or AI (Jones et al., 
2020).  
A review  of DT literature by  Jones  et al. (2020)  demonstrated 
increased interest in recent years across both academia and 
industry as seen in the growth in the number of related 
publications,  processes,  concepts,  and envisaged  benefits.  In a 
bid to determine if DT could be used in the Nature -based 
Solutions (NbS) for stormwater and transboundary water  security projects, the existing conceptual challenges and the 
DT definition as a framework were examined (Brasil et al., 
2022). They identified how the mathematical modelling 
reported in the literature could improve the DT development, 
and evaluated the potential benefits associated with the 
application of DT in NbS. Noting the sparse presence of DT 
applications in water resource management and in particular 
river basin management, the present review aims to a)  
establish the role of AI techniques such as machine learning, 
deep learning, and data analytics in enhancing the predictive 
and decision -making capabilities of digital twins, b) compile 
information about existing DT applications in developing 
countries,  c) assess  the DT infrastructure,  architecture  and data 
governance frameworks, and d) characterize the relevant DT 
use cases for river basin management. This review contributes 
towards developing a robust conceptual framework for an 
operational Limpopo River Basin DT.  
2. Literature  Review  
The era of digital technologies capable of transforming the 
livelihoods of developing country populace is now more 
obvious. Yet the inherent core pillars including the digital 
infrastructure, human capital and enabling environment, 
continue to act as impediments to these countries’ massive 
digital ecosystem potential that is hugely needed for socio - 
economic equitable growth (Union, 2020). Juxtaposing the 
role that water sensitive sectors  play in support  of advancing 
economic  growth,  socio - and gender  equity  and creating  jobs 
under changing climate, this underscores the value of  digital 
innovation ecosystem in the context of water resource

Figure 3 Trends of research themes. Upper -right quadrant are the motor themes (hot topics); themes appearing in the  upper -left quadrant are considered very spe - 
cialized  topics -niche  themes;  the lower  right  are termed basic  themes;  emerging  or declining  themes  are generally  weakly  developed,  have  low density,  low central - 
ity and are either emerging or disappearing.  
 
Fortunately,  our world  is abuzz  with disruptive  technologies 
that are transforming  the way  we respond to the  present  and 
future challenges. The digital transformation strategy for 
Africa (2020 -2030), avers that;  
“Africa presents a sea of economic opportunities in 
virtually every sector, and the continent’s youthful 
population structure is an enormous opportunity in 
this digital  era and hence  the need  for Africa  to make 
digitally  enabled  socio -economic  development  a high 
priority.”  
Against  the backdrop  of the digital  transformation  strategy  for 
Africa, there is need to ameliorate the unique challenges of 
adoption of digital technologies across Africa. There is no 
doubt that the new technologies and approaches for 
digitalizing and smartening water systems through Big Data, 
algorithm  development  and Artificial  Intelligence  (using  Deep  & Machine Learning) are increasingly being recognized 
globally. While Digital Agriculture & Digital Water 
Innovations (hereafter DA -DW-I) have a global footprint, 
arguments  for their impact  and developmental  implications  are 
generally subtle in the global South (e.g., Amankwa et al., 
2021).

Figure  4 Content  analysis  of Digital  Twin  scholarship  in Africa  (Source:  Authors)  
 
Peer-reviewed published literature on DT and river basin 
management in scientific databases (e.g., Scopus and Web of 
Science (WoS)), illustrates that the global DT scholarship on 
river basin management is generally a nascent research  
agenda. This evidence is illustrated by more than 12 years of 
publications given in Figure 2, wherein the majority of the 
scientific  articles  focusing  on DT only emerge  in the past three 
years. There were 41 peer -reviewed scientific publications on  
 
Table  2 Nature  of country  collaboration  on the DT publications  in Africa  DT with river basin references. In terms of the research 
interests across countries, the review analysis suggests that 
China  and South  African  researchers  are at the forefront,  albeit 
surprisingly lacking collaboration as most publications focus 
on single country (Table 1). In terms of emerging themes in  
the DT research domain, the review established that there are 
subtle hot topics (upper right), very specialized (upper left) as 
well as basic (lower right) and emerging (lower left) research 
themes as depicted in  Figure 3. The evolution of the research 
themes from a global perspective is expected to change as the 
direction of DT scholarship changes in future.  
In reviewing published literature on DT in Africa, few key 
words were used i.e., “Digital Twin” and “Africa” and the 
search kept to “within” abstracts only.  Only nineteen articles 
(17 from Scopus and 2 from WoS) were extracted that had 
some  content  on DT. A quick  analysis  of the trends,  and social

networks of the DT scholarship illustrated that the scientific 
discourse only emerged in databases considered from 2018 
(only one article) with most articles published in 2023 (7 
seven  articles).  Seven  peer reviewed  scientific  publications  on 
DT (where river basin management is also mentioned) were 
published between 2020 and 2022. The composition of the 
article types illustrated that most of the DT research has 
mostly  appeared  in scientific  conferences,  while  five, two, and 
four appeared in Journals, Book Chapters and Reviews 
respectively.  The nature of publication collaborations by 
country, Table 2, illustrates that DT scholars from South 
Africa and the United Kingdom exhibit both single and 
multiple country publications while France, Germany and 
Morocco have single country publications. To understand the 
research direction or applications of DT in Africa, Figure 4 
shows the content analysis of abstracts of the 17 reviewed 
articles. Though research on DT in the African continent is 
still at it’s infancy, content analysis results of the reviewed 
articles given in Figure 4 bring forth three main research 
directions,  i.e., methodology, applications  and use. It however 
important to note that these results are not exhaustive at this 
stage.  
Smart City  and Digital Twin City  are new novel methods of 
city management  being  implemented  worldwide,  in response 
to the expansion  of cities  and megacities  in the current  era of technology  disruption,  rapid  urbanization  and climate  change. 
For instance, in 2021, the University of Pretoria announced 
the creation of Hatfield Digital Twin City, a novel initiative  
that aims to boost service delivery with the help of smart 
technology (Figure 5).  
A literature  search  of smart  city applications  of DT in  the 
African continent resulted to only the following notable 
publications:  
a) Nigerian  Electricity  Supply  Industry  (NESI): Aliyu et  al. 
(2021)  analyzed  the NESI  framework  and concluded  that 
the system uses a novel framework that is premised on a 
SoS and digital twins.  
b) Broekman  and Steyn  (2022)  reported  on Digital  Twinning 
of Lap -based Marathon Infrastructure: the digitization of 
the marathon route using Real -Time Kinematic Global 
Navigation Satellite Systems (RTK GNSS) and high - 
density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensing 
capabilities to allow for the detailed geometry 
measurements and environmental analysis before and  
after such events. They concluded that the intersection of 
engineering and sports disciplines and technology 
illustrates the potential realization of smart cities and 
recreation in an evolutionary society.

South Africa.  
3. Digital  Twins  and Virtual  Reality  
In the rapidly advancing technological era we inhabit,  it is 
advantageous to critically evaluate the functionalities and 
applicability  of immersive and interactive digital technologies 
such as Virtual  Reality  (VR)  to sectors  which  impact  our well- 
being and quality of life in sectors such as agriculture and 
water management. Furthermore, it is important to explore 
how these  emergent  technologies  like VR can shape  and guide  decision making in water resources management, aid in risk 
management  and accelerate  technology  usage.  This will result 
in the generation of innovative technology -based solutions 
toward solving river basin challenges to ameliorate humanity 
and the sustainability of food and water resources.  
Gigante (1993) defines VR as being “characterized by the 
illusion of participation in a synthetic environment than 
external  observation  of such an environment.  It relies  on three - 
dimensional, stereoscopic, head -tracked displays, hand/body 
tracking, and binaural sound”. Additionally, VR may be 
delineated as an immersive, multisensory experience ( Holuša, 
et al., 2023; Azarby, & Rice, 2022). It is also referred to as 
providing virtual environments, virtual worlds, or 
microworlds. A journal titled, Development of a Digital Twin 
for smart farming: Irrigation management system for water  
Page 7:
WORKING  PAPER  
CGIAR  Initiative  on Digital  Innovation  | on.cgiar.org/digital  
7  
 saving  asserts  that the “digital  twin applied  to agriculture  is in 
its early stages of development”. It further defines a digital 
twin as an entity where “data flows automatically and in both 
directions between a physical object and a virtual  
object” (Alves, Maia & Lima, 2023). It is imperative to note 
that the adoption of these technologies is in an experimental 
phase and the consolidation of two or more technologies such 
as DT and VR is an even more recently employed practice. A 
literature  review  on the linkages  between  VR and DT revealed 
an interesting pattern of these two concepts. The concepts of 
VR and DT seems to have appeared only in the last two 
decades  (based  on the Scopus  and WoS  databases).  According 
to the two databases, 857 articles (comprising of largely 
journal articles -50%; and conference papers -25%). Most of  
the scholarship only emerged post -2018. In terms of the 
linkages between DT, VR and Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Figure  6 illustrates  detailed  interconnections  between  the three 
concepts and other antecedent terminologies. As shown in 
Figure 6, there are intrinsic interlinkages between these three 
concepts  and other  concepts  such as data analytics,  augmented 
reality, machine learning – all related to advanced 
computational techniques.  
There are a host of possibilities for the application of 
technologies such as DT and VR to actively address water 
management concerns specific to river basins in developing 
African  countries.  The unique  characteristics  DT and VR offer 
respectively  and when  combined provide  useful  real-time data 
to allow  for the continuous monitoring of river basins. Firstly, 
DT and VR offer accessible realistic digital visualizations 
which enable integrated river basin modelling. While DT 
establishes a real -time virtual representation of the river basin 
presenting water flow, dam operations, pollution sources and 
other environmental elements, VR allows for the visual 
navigation of the DT model and permits interactivity where 
users may directly impact the virtual environment they are 
visiting using their senses including sight, touch, smell and 
hearing to observe the real -time condition of river basins.  
River basins play a pivotal role in supplying fresh water and 
regulating water flow and quality. A DT and VR 
collaboratively  may be used to monitor the physical condition 
of the river basins. The DT will provide the data analytics 
required while VR will allow scientists and engineers to 
conduct virtual inspections and assessments eliminating the 
need for them to be physically present. Lastly, in the case of 
water  crises  such as droughts  or floods  the data extracted  from  the DT can  be analysed  to predict  heavy  rainfalls  that may 
cause  floods  or increased  evapotranspiration  and the over- 
extraction of ground water that may cause droughts.  
Concurrently,  VR can be employed  to pre-visualize  droughts 
and floods  before  they occur  to implement  prevention  tactics 
or mitigate the impact if inevitable.  
An exemplary  case study where DT and VR has been  utilized 
cooperatively  to combat  agricultural  related  challenges  can be 
seen through AgroIT, a company that provides technological 
solutions for the agricultural sector, particularly focusing on 
precision agriculture. AgroIT's platform uses Digital Twin 
technology to create a virtual representation of farmlands, 
incorporating data like soil conditions, weather, and crop 
health. On the VR front, they have explored its use for 
visualizing these digital farms. This combination allows 
farmers to virtually 'walk' through their fields, visualize 
potential problem areas, and make informed decisions about 
irrigation, fertilization and other operations1. 
The ambitions  of DT and VR for environmental  application in 
developing countries based on its previous uses are to aid in 
water resource management systems. This one day may be as 
advanced as integrated user interfaces. Virtual reality is also 
known as an ‘empathy machine’ because of its unique ability 
to immerse users in emotionally charged perspectives, 
experiences, and environments which may prompt positive 
actions  and behaviors  in real life. Through  the advancement  of 
brain -computer interfaces users might control DT simulations 
or navigate VR environments using their thoughts. This could 
lead to more intuitive user experiences and might even allow 
for emotion -driven simulations, where users can ""feel"" the 
impacts of different river management decisions. DT and VR 
technologies strategically locate themselves at the heart of 
digital innovation as solution -based methods that directly 
address the need for visual representations to accurately 
measure the state of water, food and land conditions within 
various  regions  susceptible to food and water wastage, natural 
disasters and shortages. Researchers and scientists look 
forward to the progression of these technologies and the 
problems they will solve in the water management sector. A 
consideration of the manner we orient and define DT and VR 
as their operations evolve and their capacity expands will be 
essential to the integration and assimilation of these ever - 
changing digital innovations.

4. Stakeholder  Needs  Assessment  
DT models are anchored on data from various life cycle 
phases that ought to be collected and analyzed to deliver 
services to a myriad of stakeholders. The utility of the DT 
services is dependent on the level of alignment with 
stakeholder needs. In order ensure uptake of the DT services, 
there  is need  to undertake  stakeholder  engagement  through  the 
development phases of the DT design and implementation.  
Stakeholders are defined as all groups and individuals who 
influence the aims of an organization, project or product and 
vice versa (Freeman and McVea, 2005). As part of  
stakeholder analysis, the stakeholders, their interests and their 
characteristics are identified. This is followed by clustering 
and prioritization  of the stakeholders.  After  analysis,  a strategy 
and recommended actions can be defined (Ramirez, 1999).  
From the DT design and implementation perspective, a 
stakeholder typology reported in Mitchael et al., (1997) as 
well as stakeholder identification based on the interest - 
influence matrix  reported in  e.g., Janssens  de Bisthoven  et al., 
(2022) should be considered. All the DT use cases relevant to 
river -based  management  presented  in Section  7.2, undertook  a 
well-designed iterative stakeholder engagement process  
during the design and implementation of the DT.  
5. 3D Representation  of a River  Basin  Digital 
Twin  
The emergence  of digital  twin technology  has revolutionized 
several fields,  from  manufacturing  to urban  planning  (Tao  et 
al., 2018).  The application  of this innovative  concept  to river basin management using the 3D Representation provides a 
compelling overview of the potential benefits and challenges 
faced.  A river  basin,  being  a complex  system  with a myriad of 
interrelated components such as water flow, sediment 
transport, vegetation, and human interventions, necessitates a 
robust modeling approach. The three -dimensional 
representation in the mentioned work provides a vivid and 
detailed visualization of these elements, making it an 
invaluable tool for stakeholders.  
6. Data  Infrastructure  Architecture  for a Digital 
Twin  
The envisioned  DT architecture  is often  characterized  by two 
main  typologies  - monitoring  and predictive  DT as  described 
in Figure 7. The monitoring typology  represents the past and 
present dynamics of the physical and social -economic 
properties and interactions with the hydroclimatic 
environment, where a virtual representation is created using 
this data. From the perspective of predictive typology, 
predictive models will use past and present data to create a 
plausible future rendition of the present state of the 
environment.  
As reported  in Brasil  et al. (2022)  and Dhulipala  (2021),  a DT 
conceptual framework comprises the components briefly 
described below (also see Figure 8):  
a) Data  source  layer:  to accurately  represent  the LRB  in a 
digital space, various data sets will be required. These 
data sets ought to represent not only the physical

Figure  8 The physical  environment,  data storage,  digital  environment  and applications  services  of the Digital  Twin  (Adapted  from  Brasil  et al., 2022)  
 
environment but also the biological and chemical 
conditions of the basin. Some of the data sources may 
include, remotely sensed data -from satellites and/or 
drones, hydrological process model data, ground 
observations (e.g., water quality/proxy measurements, 
weather  data,  mobile  app captured  data sets),  and thirty 
party datasets which are often analysis ready (e.g., 
climatic data from  the Digital Earth Africa platform  or 
non-climatic datasets  from  the National Department of 
Statistics).  
b) Data processing layer: One of the key functions of this 
layer is to pre -process and format the various data sets to 
ensure inter -operability among the various strands of the 
data. In addition, this layer executes a set of data 
modelling functions including hydrological process 
modelling, climate data downscaling and bias correction, 
satellite image classing to derive various product 
including  hydroclimatic  extremes  and irrigated  area maps.  
c) Data visualization and analytic layer: Based on the 
outputs  in b), this layer  comprises  GIS-enabled  analytic  tools embedded with dashboards to display various user 
selected features. Some of the key  outputs from  this layer 
would be the early warning messages that denote 
hydroclimatic  extremes,  risk areas  and the general  state of 
the river basin.  
d) Advisory and dissemination layer: this layer is a rule 
engine  embedded  decision  support  rule system  that helps 
provide intelligent management options suited for the 
present  and future  physical  state of the river  basin.  These 
decisions are often disseminated using channels such as 
SMS/USSD, web and mobile applications, and even 
tower broadcasts once the system is implemented.  
7. Digital  Twin Data  Governance Framework  
At the heart of the DT, is the data collection, curation, 
management, analysis as well as output of data (Figure 8). 
Since  DT information  can be viewed  as the high-end utility  of 
all the data sets, a strong  data foundation  is necessary.  To this 
end, a robust data foundation is underpinned by a strong data 
governance2 and data management3 strategy (see Plotkin,  
 
 
 
2 Data  governance  is the formal  oversight,  execution  and enforcement  of authority  over the management  of data. 
3 Data  management  is the effective  management  of data to achieve  goals  i.e. it ensures  that an organization  gets value  out of its data while  minimizing  operating  risk.

Figure  9 Data  domains  (Source:  Khatri  and Brown,  2010)  
 
2020;  Conarado,  2014).  In the context  of DT, the four decision 
domains of data governance reported in Khatri and Brown, 
(2010) are appropriate. Thus, a data governance framework 
could comprise; a) data principles (at the top) which are 
intended to establish the direction for all other decision 
domains, and set the boundary requirements for uses of data 
assets, thereby addressing standards for data quality; b) the 
data quality then determines how data are interpreted 
(metadata) as well as accessed (data access) by users; and c) 
the data life -cycle decision which defines the production, 
retention and retirement of data assets (Alhassan et al., 2016).  
The aim of the DT for river basin management could be seen 
as the exhaustive capture of all physical environment 
parameters which are often intrinsically linked to aspects of 
people's  lives, and intellectual property. Determining how  this 
information is shared between organizations and individuals 
will naturally require some data sharing policy (Jones et al., 
2020).  This even  more  so when  referring  to both physical  and 
virtual  entities - to what  extent  does DT data ownership  go? As 
a result, the question  of ownership encompasses who accesses 
the data and for what purpose. As reported in Jones et. al., 
(2020), there are social and cultural implications associated 
with the large -scale collection, storage, and sharing of data 
through the Digital Twin that need to be fully addressed 
through a data governance framework.  
While co -designed data governance framework could 
accelerate  access  and use of data and services  of the DT, the 
following key challenges ought to be overcome;  a) Cataloguing  for all the available  data collected  by 
separate  and distinct  scientists  and/or  institutions,  
b) Understanding  the data in the proper  context  and the need 
to link similar data sets together,  
c) Akin to many sectors such as financial services, retail, 
and healthcare companies, there may be a lack of 
resources  (e.g.,  data stewards)  to curate  and maintain  the 
quality of the data.  
 
8. Digital  Twin  for River  Basins Applications  
8.1. Digital  Twin  for decision  making  at the river  basin - 
level 
The utility  of DT applications  at basin  level  lies in the inherent 
adaptive capability wherein the near -real time river basin 
processes will be captured. As a result, any reactive measures 
(including  plausible  futures)  lead to improved  efficiency  of the 
basin operations, optimized uncertainty measures, early 
warning  detection  and generally  good  emergency  management 
(Pal et al., 2023). These salient features are supported by 
embedding AI algorithms with the DT architecture. The AI  
has the capability of providing additional insights beyond  
what the sensors provide t","10395"

2MILESTONES ACHIEVED
Project Launch:
The project officially began on July 1, 2023, with the signing of the funding 
agreement.
The second phase aimed to lay the groundwork for successful project 
implementation. The project’s scope and objectives were meticulously defined during this phase through extensive discussions.
Stakeholder Engagement: 
Key stakeholders, including local partners and relevant authorities, were identified and engaged in the planning process.
Project Scope & field assessment: 
The project was geographically focused on the West Showa Zone, specifically in the Wolmera and Ejere woredas, indicating a localized and targeted approach.
The HER+ Initiative involved an in-depth field assessment of various aspects 
of agriculture in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. The findings revealed the predominant cultivation of a variety of vegetables by women farmers, guided by well-documented cropping calendars and varied productivity. Agricultural practices encompassed soil preparation, seed selection, irrigation, and effective 
input utilization, as well as livestock management and marketing strategies. The 
accessibility and affordability of agricultural inputs, extension services, market services, post-harvest technologies, and financial services exhibited variations between the woredas. Despite challenges, women played pivotal roles in different 
stages of vegetable production. These insights are pivotal for informed decision-
making, facilitating targeted interventions to promote agricultural sustainability and gender equity in the region. Notably, farmers with access to SNV assistance showed significant improvements in various aspects of vegetable production compared to others.
Targeted Farmers: The project aimed to register over 5,000 farmers, focusing 
on women farmers, in the West Showa Zone, specifically in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. This implies a significant outreach effort to include a large portion of the farming community.

Input Procurement: The registered farmers could conveniently procure 
essential agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides through digital platforms. This can streamline the supply chain, making inputs more 
accessible and cost-effective.
Lersha Agents Training” was delivered at the Green Agro-Solution (GAS) 
office from September 25-26, 2023. The training aimed to refresh and enhance the information and skills of the potential Lersha agents in various areas, 
including agronomy, livestock production, Lersha application practice, and 
communication, entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, gender, and onboarding steps. The training was conducted for two consecutive days, with 12 potential Lersha agents, of which 4 are women from two woredas and the agricultural 
office focal from SNV retailers participating. On the second day, representatives 
from the Woreda agricultural offices and agro-dealers joined the training to encourage the onboarding process. To develop engagement and participation, the training was designed with various group activities, group work, and case studies in combination with PowerPoint slides and brochures. By organizing the 
agents into groups, we encouraged discussion, collaboration, and sharing of 
perspectives and experiences.

Colombo: IWMI Permanent link to cite or share this item https://hdl.handle.net/10568/132394 External link to download this item DOI Abstract/Description Meaningfully engaging women in accessing and controlling benefits from agriculture and the broader development agenda has largely remained a source of disillusionment within the development arena. More recently, there has been an increase in the use of Multistakeholder Platforms (MSP) by several actors within CGIAR and beyond. Multistakeholder dialogues aim to ensure that there is a discussion on challenges facing communities within the different landscapes and how solutions are crafted to address the challenges through practical development interventions. This paper, firstly, engages with literature on MSPs and how gender equality and social inclusion can be made intentional by including women and youths in the processes. Secondly, through the practical implementation of the Aquatic Foods Initiative in Zambia, the actual assessments and practical implementation are being monitored and critiqued through the process documentation of MSP implementation to ensure that women and youths are included. The documentation goes beyond inclusion to document the outcomes of women and youth inclusion. Thirdly, this paper situates MSPs within the CGIAR’s MSPs’ broader community of practice to draw further common threads across different contexts, different resources and across different scales. The early findings demonstrate that it is possible to engage women and youths in the designing, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the MSPs. Such engagement needs to be intentional and must invest time and resources in ensuring that participation goes beyond attendance to informing and influencing the priorities and even going further to ensure those priorities are implemented and reflected upon.

•Meaningfully engaging women in accessing and controlling benefits from 
agriculture – illusion – mirage – years required for equality.
•Multistakeholder Platforms aim to ensure that there is a discussion of challenges 
facing communities within the different landscapes and how solutions are crafted 
to address the challenges through practical development interventions.
•Multistakeholder Platforms - how gender equality and social inclusion can be 
made intentional by including women and youths in the processes .
•Monitored and critiqued through the process documentation of MSP 
implementation to ensure that women and youths are included
•The documentation goes beyond inclusion to document the processes and 
outcomes as a result of women and youth inclusion
•Situating MSPs within the broader CGIAR’s MSPs’ Community of Practice to draw 
further common threads across different contexts, different resources and across 
different scales.

•Multi-stakeholders' learning platforms will catalyze at the national and sub-
national levels the evidence to include integrated systems into project 
design and policies. 
•Water-Energy-Food-Environment nexus lens
•Holisticdevelopment
Page 6:
www.cgiar.orgPrinciples for implementation

www.cgiar.orgPreliminary Reflections
•Established a gender intentional functional Multi Stakeholder Platform for 
the Lower Kafue Basin – 3 October 2023 launched.
•Appropriate communication and coordination tools and channels are 
established among all the stakeholders. 
•Effective and meaningful engagement for all the key stakeholders in the 
Lower Kafue especially women, youths and the vulnerable.
•Lessons learnt from the Lower Kafue MSP implementation are being 
documented.
•Inclusive and sustainable MSP.
•Efficient conflict resolution mechanisms established.
•Increased basket of benefits being shared equitably in the Lower Kafue.
•A suite of development interventions identified, prioritized and funding 
opportunities explored.
Page 9:
www.cgiar.orgPreliminary Reflections (cont’d)
•It is possible to engage women, youths and vulnerable in the designing, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the MSPs. 
•Such engagement needs to be intentional and must invest time and 
resources in ensuring that participation goes beyond attendance to 
informing and influencing the priorities and even going further to ensure 
those priorities are implemented and reflected upon
•Dam operational rules and early warning system
•Upstream-Downstream linkages – PES
•CSR – dividends for development
•Gender specific interventions – aquaculture for women groups
Page 10:
www.cgiar.orgConclusion
•MSP participation is not absolute – it is fluid, created, challenged, modified, 
negotiated and re-configured - importance of facilitated stakeholder 
engagement.
•Arena where patriarchal norms are challenged and reconfigured.
•Move away from the stereotypes/binary powerful and less powerful (men –
women) – nuanced intersectional gradient.
•‘I participate. You participate. He participates. She participates . We 
participate. They control’ 
•MSP as a solution out of such a conundrum – translating research into 
impact

"9786","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Genomic regions involved in the control of 1,000-kernel weight in wild relative-derived populations of durum wheat Terminal drought is one of the most common and devastating climatic stress factors affecting durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) production worldwide. The wild relatives of this crop are deemed a vast potential source of useful alleles to adapt to this stress. A nested association mapping (NAM) panel was generated using as a recurrent parent the Moroccan variety ‘Nachit’ derived from Triticum dicoccoides and known for its large grain size. This was recombined to three top-performing lines derived from T. dicoccoides, T. araraticum, and Aegilops speltoides, for a total of 426 inbred progenies. This NAM was evaluated across eight environments (Syria, Lebanon, and Morocco) experiencing different degrees of terminal moisture stress over two crop seasons. Our results showed that drought stress caused on average 41% loss in yield and that 1,000-kernel weight (TKW) was the most important trait for adaptation to it. Genotyping with the 25K TraitGenetics array resulted in a consensus map of 1,678 polymorphic SNPs, spanning 1,723 cM aligned to the reference ‘Svevo’ genome assembly. Kinship distinguished the progenies in three clades matching the parent of origin. A total of 18 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified as controlling various traits but independent from flowering time. The most significant genomic regions were named Q.ICD.NAM-04, Q.ICD.NAM-14, and Q.ICD.NAM-16. Allelic investigation in a second germplasm panel confirmed that carrying the positive allele at all three loci produced an average TKW advantage of 25.6% when field-tested under drought conditions. The underlying SNPs were converted to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers and successfully validated in a third germplasm set, where they explained up to 19% of phenotypic variation for TKW under moisture stress. These findings confirm the identification of critical loci for drought adaptation derived from wild relatives that can now be readily exploited via molecular breeding.
