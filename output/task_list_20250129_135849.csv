Climate changemay favour pest and disease development and further exacerbate the vulnerability of smallholder farming systems to biotic constraints. Information on effects of climate change on pests and pathogens of banana is required by policy
makers and researchers in designing control strategies and adaptation plans. Since altitude is inversely related to temperature, this study used the occurrence of key banana pests and diseases along an altitude gradient as a proxy for the potential impact of changes in temperature associated with global warming on pests and diseases. We assessed the occurrence of banana pests and diseases in 93 banana fields across three altitude ranges in Burundi and 99 fields distributed in two altitude ranges in Rwanda watersheds. Incidence and prevalence of Banana Bunchy Top Disease (BBTD) and Fusarium wilt (FW) was significantly associated with temperature and altitude in Burundi, revealing that increasing temperatures may lead to upward movement of banana diseases. No significant associations with temperature and altitude were observed for weevils,
nematodes and Xanthomonas wilt of banana (BXW).

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o","Nutrition","Genomic regions involved in the control of 1,000-kernel weight in wild relative-derived populations of durum wheat Terminal drought is one of the most common and devastating climatic stress factors affecting durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) production worldwide. The wild relatives of this crop are deemed a vast potential source of useful alleles to adapt to this stress. A nested association mapping (NAM) panel was generated using as a recurrent parent the Moroccan variety ‘Nachit’ derived from Triticum dicoccoides and known for its large grain size. This was recombined to three top-performing lines derived from T. dicoccoides, T. araraticum, and Aegilops speltoides, for a total of 426 inbred progenies. This NAM was evaluated across eight environments (Syria, Lebanon, and Morocco) experiencing different degrees of terminal moisture stress over two crop seasons. Our results showed that drought stress caused on average 41% loss in yield and that 1,000-kernel weight (TKW) was the most important trait for adaptation to it. Genotyping with the 25K TraitGenetics array resulted in a consensus map of 1,678 polymorphic SNPs, spanning 1,723 cM aligned to the reference ‘Svevo’ genome assembly. Kinship distinguished the progenies in three clades matching the parent of origin. A total of 18 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified as controlling various traits but independent from flowering time. The most significant genomic regions were named Q.ICD.NAM-04, Q.ICD.NAM-14, and Q.ICD.NAM-16. Allelic investigation in a second germplasm panel confirmed that carrying the positive allele at all three loci produced an average TKW advantage of 25.6% when field-tested under drought conditions. The underlying SNPs were converted to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers and successfully validated in a third germplasm set, where they explained up to 19% of phenotypic variation for TKW under moisture stress. These findings confirm the identification of critical loci for drought adaptation derived from wild relatives that can now be readily exploited via molecular breeding.","1449"

A Comprehensive Review of Land Use, Food Systems, and Socio-Economic Drivers The drivers of deforestation and land use change in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes are complex and interconnected, shaped by various factors, including agricultural expansion, wood extraction, mining, infrastructure development, climate change, and socio-economic factors. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of these drivers and their impacts on the environment and local communities. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that accounts for both direct and underlying drivers and the unique context of each region. Effective management strategies must consider the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of these challenges. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving forest governance, empowering local communities, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders are crucial steps to protecting Peru’s natural resources. These measures can help balance economic development with environmental conservation, ensuring the sustainable use of land and resources. Equally important is addressing the underlying social and economic factors that drive land use change, including poverty, population growth, and migration. These factors often exacerbate environmental degradation and need to be integrated into broader development and conservation strategies.
A holistic approach that acknowledges the distinct challenges faced by the Amazon and Andean regions, can contribute to face deforestation as well as ensure the well-being of local communities, biodiversity conservation, and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. Such an approach requires coordinated efforts from government, non-governmental organizations, local communities, and international partners to create effective and sustainable solutions.","1295"

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o","Nutrition","'They think we are delaying their outputs' - The challenges of interdisciplinary research: understanding power dynamics between social and biophysical scientists in international crop breeding teams Public sector crop improvement for development programmes aims to produce varieties tailored to the needs of smallholder farmers and their environments. Understanding how social heterogeneity, including gender, drives trait preferences is essential to ensure that crop improvement objectives meet farmers’ and stakeholder demands. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating social science knowledge with crop breeding. Although the necessity of interdisciplinary research is recognised and promoted, it is impeded by a multitude of challenges including ontological and epistemological differences, institutional and global hierarchies, disciplinary power relations and struggles for scientific authority. The Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D) sector is marked by entrenched power differentials, including dominance of the biophysical sciences, a historical emphasis on technical solutions which ignores social contexts, and the underrepresentation of women scientists and farmers themselves. Nevertheless, there is limited theoretically informed analysis of power dynamics within AR4D settings. Drawing on qualitative, ethnographic observations of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement (ILCI), this article seeks to understand how power affects interdisciplinary research processes. Critical ethnography and power theory is used to analyse power within international crop breeding collaborations and the implications for inclusive knowledge production and research impact. The Powercube is used to examine how visible, hidden and invisible forms of power manifest within local, national, and international relationships across closed, invited and claimed spaces. Our findings suggest that these intersecting power dimensions, which include disciplinary, gendered, institutional and global hierarchies, constrain the contributions that individual researchers can make – particularly social scientists – thereby hindering disciplinary integration. The ILCI case study reveals the complex multi-dimensional dynamics that emerge within agricultural research teams and highlights structural limitations constraining efforts to build socially inclusive and gender-responsive crop improvement programmes. The article contributes to a small but growing literature studying the social construction of agricultural science, and provides insights that can enable interdisciplinary research strategies to more effectively meet the needs of farmers and other stakeholders.","1413"

The ILMP emphasizes the integration of social and ecological systems, local participation, and sustainable resource use and management within landscapes. It is a response to ‘top-down’ approaches to sustainable development, in which power and decision-making are in the hands of external development professionals. Instead, the ILMP is based on shared ownership of decision-making and the full participation of all stakeholders.
This ILMP is a product of a collaborative effort between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the AASWD, and local stakeholders from the Mankran micro-watershed of Ghana. The ILMP was developed through a participatory process that involved stakeholders from all sectors, including government, civil society, and the private sector. The process began with the creation of a narrative that served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management in the Mankran microwatershed. The research team then worked with local stakeholders to assess the current state of the landscape and identify key challenges and opportunities. Based on the assessment, the research team and stakeholders co-developed a set of management strategies and interventions that are designed to address the key challenges and achieve the desired outcomes. The ILMP was designed with a shared vision for the landscape: “To sustainably co-harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable manner to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano Southwest District. Based on the vision and identified challenges, stakeholders proposed various response strategies that included: Increased irrigation efficiency through adaptive and inclusive management; mechanisms to reduce postharvest losses; mechanism for profit or benefit sharing from mining and forestry; Enhanced gender and youth involvement in decision-making; Improved income and livelihood diversification opportunities; Improved adoption of sustainable land/forest/water management practices; Increased food safety through reduced contamination from pesticides and galamsey (illegal small-scale mining) the strengthening of local/traditional institutions for natural resources management. The ILMP also includes a monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress and ensure that the interventions are having the desired impact. It is critical to note that the ILMP is a living document that should be updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in the landscape and the needs of the stakeholders. It is hoped that the ILMP would serve as a blueprint for sustainable and inclusive landscape management in the AASWD and beyond.","1595"

Good quality feed year-round is limiting livestock productivity on-farm and resource use in farms of small to medium size. Feed production can amount to 50 to 70% of livestock production costs. Forages are a means to overcome the feed gap, and resilient forages responding to different abiotic and biotic stresses, including low soil fertility, drought / excess water, pest diseases, are essential, increasing livestock productivity by up to 15%. To scale such technologies, suitable entry points i.e., market-oriented livestock production particularly dairy are required. Enablers are animal generics and health technologies which capitalize on the improved feeding as well as capacity and dissemination channels such as cooperatives and functional seed supply systems. We are using a diversity of advanced forages which have a good availability of seed and/or planting material and demand pull through livestock production in Kenya; at the same time a pipeline for improved forages is being maintained.","1217"

The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a nutrition, health, and food security impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for nutrition, health, or food security.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering its impact on nutrition or food security.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on food availability, indirectly supporting food security.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing malnutrition in rural communities by improving access to nutritious foods.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Ending Hunger:** Enabling affordable, healthy diets for the 3 billion people who do not currently have access to safe and nutritious food.
- **Reducing Illness:** Decreasing cases of foodborne illness (600 million annually) and zoonotic diseases (1 billion annually) by one-third.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “malnutrition,” “food security,” or “public health.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, and food security.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If nutrition, health, or food security are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that nutrition, health, or food security objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

Conservation agriculture for regenerating soil health and climate change mitigation in smallholder systems of South Asia The increase in agriculture production to meet the food demand of growing human population from a limited availability of arable land with low environmental footprints and preserving natural resources (soil, water and air) simultaneously are major challenges in South Asia. The situation is further complicated by the climate change, which will further lower the food production, compounding the challenge of meeting food demand. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is solution to several challenges being faced in farming such as soil health, climate change, water scarcity, agricultural pollution, farm profitability, human health, etc. This exhaustive review examines the published literature from South Asia to assess the impact of CA on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the subsequent impacts on soil health (physical, chemical and biological properties), C sequestration and greenhouse gases emissions in major cropping systems. The results from several studies demonstrated that CA increased SOC and improved soil health parameters, mainly in the surface soil layer. The effects of CA on the changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity are small. The CA showed a remarkable positive impact on the nutrient availability in the soil. The CA system helped in both climate change mitigation and adaptation for sustainable crop production. The present gaps in our knowledge in soil health assessment and research agenda to fill the gaps are also included in this chapter. We hope this review of past accomplishments, current activities, and future opportunities will stimulate additional soil health research throughout the 21st century.","1299"

The objectives of this study were to develop a precision SPVD phenotyping protocol, to find new SPVD-resistant genotypes, and to standardize the first stages of screening for SPVD resistance. The first part of the protocol was based on ELISA results for sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and sweet potato virus C (SPVC) with adjustments to a negative control (uninfected clone 'Tanzania') and was performed on a pre-breeding population (VZ08) comprising 455 clones and 27 check clones graft-inoculated under screenhouse conditions. The second part included field studies with 52 selected clones for SPCSV resistance from VZ08 and eight checks. In screenhouse conditions, the resistant and susceptible check clones performed as expected, 63 clones from VZ08 exhibited lower relative absorbance values for SPCSV and SPVC than inoculated check Tanzania. Field experiments confirmed SPVD resistance of several clones selected by relative absorbance values (nine resistant clones in two locations, i.e. 17.3% of the screenhouse selection), supporting the reliability of our method for SPVD-resistance selection. Two clones were promising, exhibiting high storage root yields of 28.7-34.9 t ha-1 and SPVD resistance, based on the proposed selection procedure. This modified serological analysis for SPVD-resistance phenotyping might lead to more efficient development of resistant varieties by reducing costs and time at early stages, and provide solid data for marker assisted selection with a quantitative tool for classifying resistance.","1377"

The goal is to develop a high-resolution, targeted, and timely advisory package for livestock farmers through these platforms. The dataset comprises 319,569 records of text messages sent by farmers via the iShamba platform between 2015 and 2022. After data pre-processing, including filtering for livestock-specific messages and removing duplicate SMS messages, the final sample size is 72,062, with no missing data.

Recognizing the impact of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) on livestock productivity, the analysis employs the Structural Topic Model (STM) package in R. This tool explores the optimal number of topics for topic modeling, visualizes results, estimates relationships between metadata and topics, creates a Shiny application for STM results, and utilizes the Stupid Back-Off (SBO) package in R to build a predictive model for the next word(s).

The results reveal that simplifying THI and NDD stress level classes did not yield expected outcomes, especially when compared to the more intricate model of NDD. The intricate model successfully identified stress-related words and SMSs. The findings emphasize that extreme weather conditions, such as prolonged absence of rain for over 25 days in a month, trigger farmer concerns about crop health and the impact of pesticides. While the simplified model approach could have been advantageous, results may have been influenced by the specific time period during data collection","1320"

"11611","NUTRITION_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, and food security. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has set specific objectives to address global challenges in nutrition, health, and food security, aiming to improve the well-being of populations in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a nutrition, health, and food security impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research is unrelated to these areas, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for nutrition, health, or food security.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvement without considering its impact on nutrition or food security.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into these areas, but they are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that explores the impact of agricultural practices on food availability, indirectly supporting food security.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in nutrition, health, or food security.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop strategies for reducing malnutrition in rural communities by improving access to nutritious foods.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Ending Hunger:** Enabling affordable, healthy diets for the 3 billion people who do not currently have access to safe and nutritious food.
- **Reducing Illness:** Decreasing cases of foodborne illness (600 million annually) and zoonotic diseases (1 billion annually) by one-third.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “malnutrition,” “food security,” or “public health.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s objectives in these areas, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in nutrition, health, and food security.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in nutrition, health, or food security, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions these areas as important considerations but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If nutrition, health, or food security are the primary objectives of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that nutrition, health, or food security objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>""}


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a nutrition, health, and food security tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in these areas.**
