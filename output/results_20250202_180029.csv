It focuses on analyzing how various dietary scenarios in Bangladesh—ranging from the current, business-as-usual diet to diets aligned with national food-based dietary guidelines and the EAT-Lancet diet—affect diet quality and related socioeconomic and health indicators. The study’s use of foresight modeling and economic trade-off analysis is central to understanding how changes in diets may improve nutrition and public health. Moreover, the engagement with key national stakeholders (e.g., the Bangladesh National Nutrition Council) underscores that advancing healthier, more sustainable diets was a principal objective. This aligns directly with CGIAR’s Impact Area on Nutrition, Health and Food Security, justifying a score of 2 (Principal)."
