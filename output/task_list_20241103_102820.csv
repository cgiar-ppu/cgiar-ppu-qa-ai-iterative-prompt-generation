They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

By getting better at understanding what interventions work best at providing empowering opportunities, we can refine these interventions and in the long term, provide better empowering opportunities for women involved in livestock. Providing women farmers with opportunities for empowerment through livestock is important to both enhance household livelihoods and nutrition while also promoting progress on gender equity. In 2015, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), in collaboration with Emory University developed the WELI tool based on the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) developed earlier by IFPRI. The WELI measures women’s empowerment in livestock and crop agriculture and focuses specifically on key areas of livestock production, such as animal health, breeding and feeding; and on use of livestock products, such as animal-source-food processing and marketing.

The innovation highlights the platform's core purpose of supporting climate adaptation for smallholder cocoa producers in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire. By offering site-specific climate change risk assessments and tailored adaptation practices, Aclimatar serves as a vital tool in combating the effects of climate change. Its intuitive map interface allows users to select locations, providing them with essential climate data, impacts on specific crops, and prioritized adaptation strategies. This innovation is designed to enhance local projects, technicians, and organizations' understanding and response to climate variability, ensuring sustainable agricultural practices and resilience among smallholder communities.

The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT has extensive experience in using seasonal climate forecasts to improve the management of annual crops (e.g., variety selection, planting time, etc.), but there is limited experience with perennial cropping systems such as cocoa. To this end, we aim to understand which management decisions can benefit from seasonal climate forecasts, which climate variables would require good forecasting skills, and how forecasts need to be translated and communicated to end- users. To achieve this goal, the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT is applying human-centered design (HCD), a creative and participatory approach to problem-solving that allows for a deep understanding of the people for whom we design and the environments in which they live. Stakeholders are considered co-designers in the process of creating solutions or tools, whether digital or non-digital.

An integrated framework of global and country Agri-Food Market and Policy Analysis Models (AMPAM) is implemented to assess the potential for and trade-offs associated with scaling interventions and innovations that create jobs, boost incomes, and reduce environmental footprints along food value chains. A key component of AMPAM is the consistent and comparable set of indicators of degrees of policy support to agriculture and food sectors by type of support, food commodities, and countries. This set of policy indicators has been prepared in collaboration with the AgIncentives Consortium (FAO-IFPRI-IDB-OECD-World Bank). Together with the agrifood market database and the AMPAM modeling framework, the policy indicator dataset will be a critical ingredient for the scenario analysis the Initiative will undertake to support decision-makers in assessing the full potential, scalability, market opportunities, priorities for, and trade-offs associated with incentive schemes, and investments and innovations.
