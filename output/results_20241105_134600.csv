Furthermore, the allelic investigation in a secondary germplasm panel revealed significant phenotypic advantages under drought conditions, and the conversion of SNPs to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers, validated in a third germplasm set, demonstrates practical applicability. These accomplishments reflect thorough validation of the innovation under semi-controlled conditions, aligning with the 'Prototype' level of the Innovation Readiness Scale. The readiness to exploit the identified loci via molecular breeding indicates that the innovation is well-positioned for operational deployment, although full-scale uncontrolled testing and widespread implementation have yet to be achieved.

A nested association mapping (NAM) panel comprising 426 inbred progenies was evaluated across eight diverse environments over two crop seasons, establishing the significant impact of terminal moisture stress on yield and highlighting 1,000-kernel weight (TKW) as a key adaptive trait. Genotyping with the 25K TraitGenetics array produced a comprehensive consensus map with 1,678 polymorphic SNPs aligned to the reference 'Svevo' genome. Eighteen stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, with the most significant regions—Q.ICD.NAM-04, Q.ICD.NAM-14, and Q.ICD.NAM-16—validated in a second germplasm panel, demonstrating an average TKW advantage of 25.6% under drought conditions. Further, the conversion of SNPs to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers and their successful validation in a third germplasm set, where they accounted for up to 19% of phenotypic variation for TKW under moisture stress, underscores the practical applicability of the findings. The comprehensive field validations across multiple germplasm sets and environmental conditions indicate that the innovation is not only effective under controlled settings but also performs reliably under uncontrolled, real-world conditions. These achievements collectively demonstrate that the developed molecular breeding tools are ready for large-scale implementation, fulfilling the criteria for a proven innovation.

Throughout 2023, the collaboration between CIAT, the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA), and partners across 16 African countries successfully tested 272 lines from local breeding programs alongside CIAT. Additionally, seventeen Tanzanian bean varieties underwent rigorous testing with 1,682 farmers, ensuring that the innovations meet real-world agricultural demands and diverse market needs. This extensive field testing with a substantial number of stakeholders indicates that the innovations have moved beyond controlled environments and are being assessed in practical, semi-controlled settings. The iterative breeding cycle, which incorporates feedback from farmers, seed companies, and end-users, further underscores the project's commitment to refining and validating the varieties for broader adoption. While the innovations have not yet undergone testing in completely uncontrolled conditions, the current stage of validation under semi-controlled environments aligns with the criteria for a prototype readiness level.

The completed activities focused on conducting qualitative, ethnographic observations of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement (ILCI) to understand the power dynamics between social and biophysical scientists within international crop breeding teams. By employing critical ethnography and power theory, the research validated key concepts related to how disciplinary, gendered, institutional, and global hierarchies influence interdisciplinary collaboration and the inclusivity of crop improvement programs. The use of the Powercube framework further substantiated these concepts by examining visible, hidden, and invisible forms of power across various relational spaces. These efforts collectively provided evidence that the identified power dimensions constrain contributions from social scientists, thereby hindering the integration of disciplines. Although the project has not yet advanced to the stages of controlled or semi-controlled testing of interventions based on these insights, it has successfully validated the foundational concepts necessary to inform future innovation strategies.

This indicates that the innovation, bocashi fertilizer, has progressed beyond initial development and has been introduced to end-users in a real-world setting. The training suggests that the fertilizer has been refined to a prototype stage and is being validated under semi-controlled conditions, where real-world factors are taken into account but some level of oversight or structure remains. By engaging producers directly, the project demonstrates that the innovation has moved past controlled environments and is being tested for practical applicability and impact in actual farming conditions. This aligns with Innovation Readiness Level 7, which pertains to the validation of an innovation’s ability to achieve specific impacts under semi-controlled conditions. The initiative's emphasis on replacing chemical inputs with organic alternatives also highlights a strategic approach to scaling the innovation, further supporting the assignment of a Level 7 readiness.

Completed activities include conducting farmer surveys to inform the selection of non-rice crops, such as mung bean and watermelon, for crop diversification. The cultivation of these crops during specific seasons has been evaluated for their impact on ecosystem services and agricultural yield. Initial data analysis has yielded positive results, indicating improvements in the cost-benefit ratio, reduction in thrips damage, and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to non-diversified systems, while maintaining comparable grain yields.
