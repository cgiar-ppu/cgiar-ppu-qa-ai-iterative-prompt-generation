"37","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Bean breeding networks in Africa accelerate genetic gains for drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified varieties including bush and climbing beans, meeting farmer and seed company demands in diverse markets Common beans are an important staple food for more than 200 million Africans, providing an affordable source of proteins, complex carbohydrates and valuable micronutrients. They improve soil fertility and are a significant source of income. In collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) and farmers, CIAT and national bean breeding efforts seek to develop improved and marketable bush and climbing bean varieties, including biofortified varieties and niche market varieties. Past progress in resistance to bean diseases and tolerance to drought is being extended to edaphic constraints and adaptation to high temperatures.  Breeding is a cyclical process that adjusts to feedback from farmers, seed companies and end-users. Breeding cycle time at CIAT is between 12 and 24 months. During 2023, partners in 16 African countries tested 272 lines from local breeding programs and CIAT. Seventeen Tanzanian varieties were tested with 1682 farmers.

Small farms are responsible for 80% of world food production, making them key to addressing looming global food shortages (Lowder et al., 2016). Small farms in developing countries navigate a myriad of challenges, including access to information, quality inputs, capital, markets, and among others, land (FAO, 2014). These challenges can be exacerbated for women and other marginalized groups of people due to social normatives within their communities (Petesch, Badstue, & Prain, 2018; Polar et al., 2017; Rola‐Rubzen et al., 2020). Inclusive innovation to address agriculture productivity and loss gaps is tantamount to equitable global food security (FAO, 2014; FAO, 2011). However, many innovations still fail to help stimulate disruption in gender or social inequities, and some even do additional harm. Increasing use of an innovation, referred to as ‘scaling,' is critical to impact at a community or regional level, and is often seen as necessary to support Agriculture Research for Development (AR4D) outcomes (Sartas et al., 2020). Several scaling support tools and methodologies have been developed to assist researchers and practitioners in scaling processes. However, little practical attention has been given to the specific cross-section of gender and relevant diversity within scaling tools and methodologies. This narrative literature review begins to address this by answering: 1) What are unique gender considerations when scaling agricultural innovations?; and 2) What are appropriate methods and approaches for collecting data on these unique gender considerations? Our review finds six points of attention to reflect upon unique gender considerations when innovating and scaling innovation: i) Comprising research and project teams, ii) Designing agricultural innovations, iii) Communicating and extension of innovation, iv) Choosing scale models: entrepreneurship and business development, v) Reinventing and changing technology, and vi) Engaging with the political economy of innovation. Methods to collect necessary data to accurately reflect on these considerations and avoid unintended negative consequences for more gender responsible scaling are also presented. Finally, the literature review is situated in a perspective that more attention should be given to agricultural innovation and scaling support tools and methodologies to address gender or socially marginalized groups.

The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT has extensive experience in using seasonal climate forecasts to improve the management of annual crops (e.g., variety selection, planting time, etc.), but there is limited experience with perennial cropping systems such as cocoa. To this end, we aim to understand which management decisions can benefit from seasonal climate forecasts, which climate variables would require good forecasting skills, and how forecasts need to be translated and communicated to end- users. To achieve this goal, the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT is applying human-centered design (HCD), a creative and participatory approach to problem-solving that allows for a deep understanding of the people for whom we design and the environments in which they live. Stakeholders are considered co-designers in the process of creating solutions or tools, whether digital or non-digital.

3 CGIAR IPSR Innovation Portfolio Management | CGIAR Regional Integrated Initiative for Diversification in East and Southern Africa (Ukama Ustawi)INNOVATION TYPOLOGIES
CGIAR and partners work on a broad variety of innovations to achieve outcomes and impact. These include (1) 
technologies (e.g. germplasm; management practices; machines; data systems), (2) capacity development innovations 
(e.g. training programs; guidelines, e-learning courses), and (3) policy, organizational or institutional innovations 
(governance frameworks, business models, finance mechanisms).
The nature of the innovations and innovation processes may be different. Incremental innovations follow a steady 
process of gradual improvement. Radical innovations replace existing technologies, practices and institutions. 
Disruptive innovations trigger major system reconfiguration or transformation.
The below graphs provide an overview of the innovation type and nature in this portfolio.seal-question

1INNOVATION GEOFOCUSINNOVATION TYPOLOGIES
CGIAR and partners work on a broad variety of innovations to achieve outcomes and impact. These include (1) 
technologies (e.g. germplasm; management practices; machines; data systems), (2) capacity development innovations 
(e.g. training programs; guidelines, e-learning courses), and (3) policy, organizational or institutional innovations 
(governance frameworks, business models, finance mechanisms).
The nature of the innovations and innovation processes may be different. Incremental innovations follow a steady 
process of gradual improvement. Radical innovations replace existing technologies, practices and institutions. 
Disruptive innovations trigger major system reconfiguration or transformation.

"5365","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

 Introduction  
Background 
This report summarizes findings from the project “Agroecological transitions for building resilient and 
inclusive agricultural and food systems (TRANSITIONS)” which is funded by the European Commission 
through its Development of Smart Innovation through Research in Agriculture (DeSIRA) initiative and 
managed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Digital Tools regional work 
in Vietnam focused on research and engagement with digital tools for technical advice and performance 
assessment in sustainable rice production in the Mekong River Delta due to the high climate change 
impacts, climate change mitigation potentials and sustainability challenges.  
Methodology  
This report focused on the learnings from 2 field studies. The first conducted in September 2022 in Can 
Tho province in the Mekong Delta with 24 farmers and extension agents. The digital tool tested was a 
prototype created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for 
rice farmers. The second conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta on SRP farming 
practices and digital tool use. Data was collected in March 2023, through FGDs with 20 farmers and 5 
field agents. The digital tool tested was a prototype created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is 
designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of GHG emissions.   
The purpose of the FGDs was to: 
 Discuss the support that farmers receive in terms of sources of information/guidance and 
performance assessment in rice production. 
 Discuss how farmers use digital tools to improve, monitor, and evaluate their SRP farming practices.

Farmers’ agroecology practices and sources of technical advice/performance 
assessment 
Non-contracted farmers cultivate rice in three cropping seasons thus, they do not cultivate other crops 
besides rice. They want to decrease to two rice cropping seasons since there is limited profit. It will 
require local government support to convert from three cropping seasons to two cropping seasons. 
Some contracted farmers diversify to other crops besides rice in order to increase their income. They 
cultivate fruit trees like durian, jackfruit, and longan in Thoi Lai and Co Do districts.   
Farmers use a number of methods to improve input use efficiency. This includes the use of the Three 
Reductions, Three Gains (3R3G) approach and One Must Do, 5 Reductions (1M5R) which are both 
government programmes to decrease seed, fertilizer, and pesticide input use. Contracted farmers plant 
their rice based on the recommended schedule of the local government. They use sowing with drum 
seeders or mechanized transplanting, spraying is done by drone, and they use a combine harvester to 
harvest the crop. They also implement ecological engineering for pest management in rice crops such as 
planting nectar-rich flower plants on the bunds surrounding rice fields. They apply the alternate wetting 
and drying (AWD) technique for water management and monitor the water level using water tubes. The 
contracting companies require farmers to use high-quality certified seeds, reduce fertilizers and 
pesticides, refrain from pumping water into fields, and use pesticides 20 days before harvest. The 
application of new measures/technologies are done in agreement with the company and the company 
provides training for farmers. The contracted companies pay an additional 200 VND/kg for rice. 
Contracted farmers access information through training courses, demonstration models, field visits from 
extension staff, television, communications via Zalo, Facebook (i.e. to inform each other in case of pests 
or diseases), Agricultural forecast bulletin (CIAT), MobiAgri application, and previous experiences. 
Non-contracted farmers are beginning to use improved methodologies. They use a reduced seed rate 
with 10-15kg/1300m2 (around 80-120kg/ha). They also use certified seeds, reduce chemical fertilisers 
and increase use of organic fertilizers. They are also reducing the number of seasonal pesticide sprayings 
from 5-6 times to 2-3 times as well as not using pesticides during the first 40 days after sowing. They are 
influenced by market requirements, application of new technologies by neighbouring farmers, concerns 
Page 9:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 for environmental impacts, and their desire to reduce input costs. They receive most of the technical 
advice through demonstration models, training classes, television, and talking with other farmers. 
In general, farmers find local agricultural field agents and company field agents the most reliable sources 
of information, followed by experienced fellow farmers and rice buyers. The preferred methods of 
advisory include regular field visits and face-to-face meetings where field agents are able to observe the 
field and provide accurate responses. Farmers and field agents usually use instant messaging methods 
such as Zalo for exchanging of information. Official weekly reports are made in written form. 
Testing of Agritask mobile application 
The digital tool tested during the first field testing in Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta was a prototype 
created by Agritask. The tool is designed to support data collection and technical advice for rice farmers. 
The system is designed for use by both men and women. It is expected to improve efficiency in the data 
collection process whilst simplifying the process for farmers and reducing errors. With time, it is hoped 
that the tool will be used for SRP certification. The current business model is designed on the 
mechanism of paying farmers to use, since rice farmers do not display a strong desire to use digital tools 
to facilitate the data collection process. Farmers expect that this process should be facilitated by field 
agents as such, it will be important for Agritask to think about whether there is scalability in this 
approach. A more scalable approach would be to target field agents as the end users and as such 
developing a tool suitable for their needs. 
The farmers and field agents considered the Agritask application to be useful for the recording of 
farming practices and a more convenient approach than using pen and paper recording. The information 
is structured well and arranged logically. It is considered to have generally user-friendly interfaces. The 
pest and disease recommendations are useful and there are calculations of cost and profit, enabling 
comparison between seasons. 
Suggestions for improvement 
It was considered very important that farmers are able to extract and share the data that they have 
entered. There were a number of recommendations to reduce the rate of errors. It was recommended 
to allow farmers to edit data retrospectively in case of errors while recording. Allowing duplication of 
records where practices do not change over time can reduce errors for example, area or type and 
Page 10:
Use of digital tools in sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam 
 volume of pesticides. Duplication of some entry points can also save a significant amount of time. It was 
suggested that a reminder warning be included if a user forgets to input data (according to an 
established frequency such as daily or weekly or a few times per week) similarly pest/disease warning 
were considered to be useful. Award points could encourage farmers to use frequently. 
Some more specific recommendations are: 
 Use of digit separators (. ,) 
 Charts of farming results (cost, yield, revenue, profit, etc.) to compare with the same season across 
different years. 
 The app currently does not allow saving data for the current day. It only allows saving for dates up 
to the date before the current date. Sometimes farmers use lunar calendar for crop establishment, 
it would be good if the app can show both lunar and solar calendars. 
 Machinery cost should be broken down to specific items such as land preparation, tillage/ploughing, 
sowing, etc.  
 Allow users to add items not available in the pre-designed lists of fertilisers and pesticides (some 
common fertilisers such as urea, DAP, Kali NPK 16-16-8, NPK 20-20-15 are not in the list). Under pest 
management: mouse management is missing. 
 Labour cost can be VND/day and can sometimes be a lump sum cost (not determined by labour 
day), so the app should allow to record labour cost by area (i.e. ha or season). 
 The area unit varies between provinces. While farmers in one province are familiar with ha, those in 
other provinces are more familiar with “big cong” (equivalent to 1296m2). 
 Farmers are confused among units of fertilizer (the way of inputting is not friendly to them) and the 
units for pesticide were too limiting. Some people would prefer litres, while others prefer bottles or 
other units.  
 The app’s error alerts were confusing to farmers, sometimes the alerts were in English even though 
the device system language and the app language were both in Vietnamese.

SRP management 
Rikolto launched their SRP project in Dong Thap 2018 with implementation of the model commencing at 
the end of 2019. By 2020, the program had been scaled up to involve approximately 800 small holder 
farmers across eight cooperatives, covering a total of 2,000-3,000 hectares of land. 
Scoring occurs once per crop season, typically at the end of the season. Agents visit farmers weekly to 
monitor progress, assess the current situation, and take notes for a summary report. The process to 
input farming data for SRP monitoring and scoring takes approximately two hours per SRP farmer. At the 
time of survey, SRP scoring was done by technicians in the local areas who had been trained in SRP in 
cooperation with the cooperatives; most farmers who joined this program reached 80% and above. 
There was a plan that Rikolto would hire an independent body to perform the scoring in 2023 with the 
expectation of selling rice at a higher price. 
Agents maintain records of each SRP farmer's name, rice area, field address, and phone number on hard 
copy documents. The SRP project provides agents an Excel form for scoring. SRP farmers keep record of 
farming diaries using a notebook provided by the project. The rice management diary includes 
information on seed varieties, fertilizer usage, harvesting practices, labour costs, yields, prices, and 
productivity. At the end of the season, these diaries are collected by field agents to input into a digital 
format (normally Excel) for scoring.  
It was reported that production cost reduced up to 30% per season. Currently, there is no contract 
farming scheme for SRP rice under this project. Farmers sell rice either to companies under the 
cooperatives’ on-going contracts or to middlemen. SRP rice under this project is sold at prices that are 
100-200 VND/kg higher than market prices for regular rice; the difference comes from negotiation based 
on improved quality (i.e., use of certified seeds and reduced chemical use). Some farmers indicated that 
after completing the pilot project, they would continue to implement the SRP techniques due to the 
financial benefits from saving input costs and health benefits for farmers. Some farmers shared that 
they would continue the model if the rice is certified and sold at considerably higher prices.

 In general, all famers apply AWD. Even during the wet season (Autumn – Winter), sometimes water is 
pumped out of the field to prevent logging. Farms use certified pesticides and apply integrated pest 
management practices to control pesticide use. Straw is generally incorporated before wet seasons and 
collected and sold during dry seasons. Straw is sold for production of mushroom, ornamental plants and 
flowers or compost.

Challenges faced by field agents while using digital tools  
Data is collected by field agents in pen and paper form in the field. When the agents return to their 
office this data is transcribed on to Excel. The software does not have all the statistical functions 
needed, and agents must use additional software like SPSS for further analysis. Additionally, it takes 
time to enter information from the notebook to Excel while doing SRP scoring. 
Communication tools such as Zalo are commonly used by field agents to communicate with farmers. 
Google maps is sometimes used by field agents however, it doesn’t meet the resolution needs to meet 
the requirements of users/officers in monitoring rice growth stages and pest detection. 
Field agents expressed an interest in using an app and transferring the notebook/diary to manage online 
by an application to save time, ensure consistency, and provide convenience. There was the suggestion 
of integrating the scoring function into the app so that farmers can enter data themselves under the 
support of field agents.  
Testing of CropPal mobile application 
The second field testing conducted in the Dong Thap province in the Mekong Delta tested a prototype 
created by AgriG8 called CropPal. The tool is designed to support SRP certification and the calculation of 
Page 13:

 GHG emissions. They are still in the process of developing a sustainable business model. They are 
proposing the app be pay for use by farmers or supported by financial institutions. It will be important to 
develop a long term scalable business model. One approach could be to design the app for use by public 
sector and private sector field agents, who work directly with farmers for SRP certification.  
Field agents considered CropPal to be generally convenient, accessible, and suitable for users/farmers. 
They liked the ability of CropPal to retain information.  It was suggested that a reminder warning be 
included for incomplete information in each section and there be a function to review the history of 
entered information. It was requested that there be a function to export outputs to Excel. It was 
proposed the design of a season management section by year. 
Interface 
Farmers struggled to interpret the icons. It was suggested that changing the icons to text or 
photographic images that are familiar to farmers which would make the buttons more easily 
recognisable. Farmers also preferred to have each button in its own distinctive colour. Vietnamese 
needs to be used as the primary language throughout the app. 
Field agents had a preference for use of kg unit instead of “bag” unit. Field agents suggested changing 
from drop down options to a blank space which allows flexibility of answer. List all fertilizer categories 
and leave the corresponding quantity blank for users. They suggested changing the way to log in to 
CropPal, using the user's phone number to get the number code automatically, which is only required 
the first time using the app. The app could then be managed by the field agents using farmer code. 
Functions 
It was recommended that the application include more statistical functions on varieties e.g. variety type, 
quantity/area of sowing). They would like additional functions for productivity and information about 
expenses for fertilizers, and labour costs. The definition of the duration of each rice variety should be 
adjusted as follows: Short-term rice (85-90 days), medium-term rice (95 days), long-term rice (>110 
days). Pest detection time needs to be included (dd/mm)

Conservation agriculture for regenerating soil health and climate change mitigation in smallholder systems of South Asia The increase in agriculture production to meet the food demand of growing human population from a limited availability of arable land with low environmental footprints and preserving natural resources (soil, water and air) simultaneously are major challenges in South Asia. The situation is further complicated by the climate change, which will further lower the food production, compounding the challenge of meeting food demand. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is solution to several challenges being faced in farming such as soil health, climate change, water scarcity, agricultural pollution, farm profitability, human health, etc. This exhaustive review examines the published literature from South Asia to assess the impact of CA on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the subsequent impacts on soil health (physical, chemical and biological properties), C sequestration and greenhouse gases emissions in major cropping systems. The results from several studies demonstrated that CA increased SOC and improved soil health parameters, mainly in the surface soil layer. The effects of CA on the changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity are small. The CA showed a remarkable positive impact on the nutrient availability in the soil. The CA system helped in both climate change mitigation and adaptation for sustainable crop production. The present gaps in our knowledge in soil health assessment and research agenda to fill the gaps are also included in this chapter. We hope this review of past accomplishments, current activities, and future opportunities will stimulate additional soil health research throughout the 21st century. Chapter Three.

The objectives of this study were to develop a precision SPVD phenotyping protocol, to find new SPVD-resistant genotypes, and to standardize the first stages of screening for SPVD resistance. The first part of the protocol was based on ELISA results for sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and sweet potato virus C (SPVC) with adjustments to a negative control (uninfected clone 'Tanzania') and was performed on a pre-breeding population (VZ08) comprising 455 clones and 27 check clones graft-inoculated under screenhouse conditions. The second part included field studies with 52 selected clones for SPCSV resistance from VZ08 and eight checks. In screenhouse conditions, the resistant and susceptible check clones performed as expected, 63 clones from VZ08 exhibited lower relative absorbance values for SPCSV and SPVC than inoculated check Tanzania. Field experiments confirmed SPVD resistance of several clones selected by relative absorbance values (nine resistant clones in two locations, i.e. 17.3% of the screenhouse selection), supporting the reliability of our method for SPVD-resistance selection. Two clones were promising, exhibiting high storage root yields of 28.7-34.9 t ha-1 and SPVD resistance, based on the proposed selection procedure. This modified serological analysis for SPVD-resistance phenotyping might lead to more efficient development of resistant varieties by reducing costs and time at early stages, and provide solid data for marker assisted selection with a quantitative tool for classifying resistance.

The intervention included a variety of strategies designed to improve: (1) the affordability through a coupon system; (2) the acceptability through a promotional campaign about the importance of eating fruits and vegetables every day; and (3) a combination of both through a loyalty card system and improvements in point of sales, product display, marketing, delivery of nutritional information to consumers, food safety, and customer service practices. The bundled intervention was implemented over twelve months and led to a marginal increase in the proportion of females consuming fruits and vegetables during the intervention period in both countries.

Low fruit and vegetable (FV) intake in low- and middle-income countries, which is associated with noncommunicable diseases and micronutrient deficiencies, requires food system interventions addressing FV accessibility, affordability, and acceptability. Periodic FV intake monitoring during interventions informs progress toward achieving increased intakes and contributes to understanding the effectiveness of these interventions. Objectives
This study evaluates the trend in FV intake before, during, and after implementation of a set of nutrition-sensitive food system interventions addressing accessibility, affordability, and acceptability to increase FV consumption over a 1-y period in Vietnamese and Nigerian low-income urban and periurban females. Methods
We used the Diet Quality Questionnaire to assess FV food group consumption among 600 Vietnamese (Hanoi) and 610 Nigerian (Ibadan) females before, during, and after the interventions (Vietnam: July 2020–September 2021; Nigeria: November 2020–December 2021). A FV score was compared between exposure groups with (mixed) count modeling. The trend in consumption of individual FV groups was analyzed with mixed logistic regression. Results
The FV score was stable over time, and a small increase was observed after the intervention period especially in Nigeria and in urban Vietnam. A decrease in the total score was observed in periurban Vietnam. Fluctuations were detected in the probability of consumption of individual FV groups over time especially within the fruit groups, probably due to seasonal availability. The degree of exposure could not explain differences in FV intake. Conclusions
We found a marginal increase in the proportion of females consuming FV during the interventions in both countries. The FV score appeared to be a simple, quick, and easy-to-use indicator for monitoring diversity, variety, and consumption.

This project seeks to comprehend historical messaging patterns and their correlation with climate 
hazard data from livestock farmers' current interactions with agriculture service provider platforms 
like iShamba. The goal is to develop a high -resolution, targeted, and timely advisory package for 
livestock far mers through these platforms. The dataset comprises 319,569 records of text 
messages sent by farmers via the iShamba platform between 2015 and 2022. After data pre -
processing, including filtering for livestock -specific messages and removing duplicate SMS 
messages, the final sample size is 72,062, with no missing data.  
 
Recognizing the impact of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) on livestock 
productivity, the analysis employs the Structural Topic Model (STM) package in R. This tool 
explores the optimal number of topics for topic modeling, visualizes res ults, estimates relationships 
between metadata and topics, creates a Shiny application for STM results, and utilizes the Stupid

The results reveal that simplifying THI and NDD stress level classes did not yield expected 
outcomes, especially when compared to the more intricate model of NDD. The intricate model 
successfully identified stress -related words and SMSs. The findings empha size that extreme 
weather conditions, such as prolonged absence of rain for over 25 days in a month, trigger farmer 
concerns about crop health and the impact of pesticides. While the simplified model approach

 Introduction  
 
iShamba, part of MediaE company, is a call centre  staffed by agricultural professionals where 
farmers can SMS in their inquiries or phone in for immediate assistance. Along with the weather 
updates and market prices, iShamba offers Agri -tips on crops and livestock after a farmer signs up. 
Farmers can eit her sign up for free or choose a premium plan for a small fee per year.  
Overview  
 
The Climate Action team's Livestock and Climate Initiative project, led by Scientist Dharani Dhar 
Burra, is interested in understanding historical messaging patterns and their correlation with 
climate hazards data from livestock farmers' current interactio ns with agriculture service provider 
platforms like iShamba. This information will further help to develop a high resolution targeted/ 
timely advisory package for livestock farmers through the service provider platforms.  
Objectives  
 
This project will aim to:  
 
1. Understand current trends/patterns of historical interactions of farmers with the iShamba 
platform.  
2. Identify if there is a pattern between messaging from farmers and climate hazards.  
3. We can then estimate farmers information requirements much ahead of time based on the 
forecasted climate hazards.  
4. This pre -emption of information requirement will then help us build more targeted advisory 
packages for the livestock farmers.  
5. Assess the applicability of the targeted advisories sent to the farmers through surveys.  
Data  
 
This project aims to analyze unstructured data from the iShamba platform, specifically text 
messages sent by farmers between the years 2015 to 2022. The initial plan was to utilize two 
years of data, but after preliminary data processing, many cases were d ropped due to incomplete 
or one -word messages received from the farmers, leading to a significant drop in the number of 
observations.         
 
The dataset received from the iShamba platform for the specified years contains 319,569 records. 
However, after data pre -processing and filtering to include only livestock -specific messages, and 
manually deleting duplicate SMS messages, the final sample si ze for this study is 72,062, with no 
missing data in the dataset.   
 
The variables included in the dataset are Task ID, Customer ID, Date, Time, Description, 
SMS sent by farmers, Responses to SMS, Assignees, Priority, SMS Tags, County, Sub - 
County, Wards, and x and y location points. The analysis will focus on the following  
variables:  
 
Page 4:
 
Page. 4  
 • Date - a character variable recorded by the platform for every farmer's inquiry received. The 
year and month will be extracted to calculate climate hazards later in the analysis.  
• SMS sent by farmers - a character variable containing the text messages received by 
farmers on the iShamba platform.  
• Sub-county - a character variable that records the county location of the farmer.  
• Ward - a character variable that records the sub -county location of the farmer.  
 
The number of dry days (NDD) and heat stress livestock index (THI) are both recognized to reduce 
the productivity of livestock. However, the Agriculture Adaptation Atlas does not provide the mean 
number of NDD and THI for the years 2015 -2022. Therefore, bo th climate hazards were computed 
monthly for each year and ward using a projected climate hazards model. This will help to develop 
a relationship between the text messages received by farmers and both climate hazards. The 
overall goal of this relationship is to project future advisories that iShamba can send to livestock 
farmers regarding climate hazards at appropriate time in their location.  
 
Methodology  
 
I.Data Pre -Processing  
 
The data pre -processing for this project was conducted using R, due to the unstructured 
nature of the data. The initial step involved the removal of special characters, numbers, 
brackets, and quotes. This was followed by the separation of the time and date into new 
variables to extract the year and month for calculating the mean climate hazards in later 
analysis.  
 
The third step of the pre -processing included trimming the white spaces between text, 
selecting SMS messages that had a character count of 3 or above, and converting all text to 
lowercase. Additionally, some misspelled words in the SMS sent by farmers colu mn were 
corrected to enhance the accuracy of the subsequent analysis.  
 
A total of 140 wards were missing in the dataset, but their location points X and Y were 
available. To obtain the names of these wards, a join was performed with a Kenya shapefile 
dataset using the X and Y location points. This allowed for the extraction of the missing ward 
names, completing the dataset. Finally, records of counties that were not in Kenya and rows 
with ""NA"" across the county, sub -county, ward, and X and Y location points were dropped. The 
resulting p re-processed dataset had 252,759 observations.  
 
II.Filtering data to livestock  
 
To filter the dataset to focus only on livestock -related queries, a text analysis was performed 
using the ""Tm"" package in R to tokenize the SMS messages into words. A total of 264 words 
were removed, including non -English words and common words that were n ot relevant to the 
analysis. This resulted in a list of 81,114 unique words. The tokenized words list was then 
shared with iShamba to identify livestock -related words, which were flagged as ""high,"" while 
words that were not related to livestock were flagged as ""low."" This process yielded a list of 
Page 5:
 
Page. 5  
 5,956 unique words related to livestock. These words were used to filter the text messages to 
only include those that contained one or more words related to livestock.  
 
This filtering process resulted in a dataset of 78,169 observations. However, to eliminate 
duplicate SMS messages, a manual deletion process was conducted, resulting in a reduced 
dataset of 72,062 observations. A join operation was performed by creating a file containing 
unique IDs of sub -counties and wards, which was then merged with the filtered text data.  
 
To compute the monthly NDD and THI values for each ward, the same computation steps 
used for the development of the global adaptation atlas ( AdaptationAtlas - hazards ) were 
applied. The resulting data was aggregated to obtain average values for each month/year and 
ward. These average values were appended to the iShamba dataset, which contained the 
corresponding month, year, and ward for each SMS message.  
 
To facilitate analysis and interpretation, the NDD and THI values were transformed into new 
binary categorical variables as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl: a character variable defined as1: 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress"" = “yes”,  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”.  
 
• ndd_lvl: a character variable defined as:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress"" = “no”,  
• NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress"" = “yes”,  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress"" = “yes”.  
 
Consequently, the final dataset consists of 72,062 observations and includes six variables: 
SMS (actual) by farmers, month, year, ward, thi_lvl, and ndd_lvl. This filtered dataset was 
used for the subsequent analysis.  
 
III.Analysis  
 
Structural Topic Model (STM) provides a variety of statistical approaches for analyzing text 
data. The STM allows one to discover topics and estimate their relationship to document 
metadata. The  “stm” package in R provides tools to facilitate the workflow associated with 
analyzing textual data and users have a broad array of options to process raw text data, 
explore and analyze the data, and present findings using a variety of plotting tools.  
 
The steps involved in the STM topic prevalence model are as follows:  
 
1. Loading the data in R:  The ""stm"" package represents the text corpus in three parts:  
 
• A documents list containing word indices and their associated counts.  
 
1 The iShamba data has no THI “sever stress” cases.  
Page 6:
 
Page. 6  
 • A vocab character vector containing the words associated with the word indices.  
• A metadata matrix containing document covariates.  
 
2. Applying the ""textProcessor"" function:  This function is used to preprocess the data 
by removing punctuation, eliminating stop words, and stemming the words. It leverages 
the ""tm"" package and can be applied across multiple languages.  
 
3. Using the utility function ""prepDocuments"":  This function processes the loaded 
data to ensure it is in the correct format. It can also remove infrequent terms based on 
a user -set parameter called ""lower.thresh."" Additionally, ""prepDocuments""  will re -
index all metadata and document relationships if any changes occur during the 
processing. If a document is completely removed due to preprocessing (e.g., if it 
contained only rare words), the corresponding row in the metadata will be dropped. It i s 
important to inspect the document features and vocabulary list after reading and 
processing the text data to verify that the preprocessing steps have been applied 
correctly . 
 
These steps are crucial for preparing the data for the subsequent stages of the STM topic 
prevalence model. After the data import process in steps 2 and 3, the text corpus includes of 
71,105 documents and 16,467 tokens.  
 
4. Exploration of Topic Model s: Determining the optimal number of topics for a given 
corpus is not a straightforward task (Grimmer and Stewart 2013). To address this 
challenge, the ""searchK""  function employs a data -driven approach to select the 
appropriate number of topics. This function conducts various automated tests, such as 
calculating the held -out likelihood (Wallach et al. 2009) and performing residual 
analysis (Taddy 2012). By default , the ""Spectral""  initialization method is used due to 
its stability. Additionally, the ""searchK""  function computes several informative metrics, 
including average exclusivity and semantic coherence, to assist in the selection 
process.  
 
5. Estimating the structural topic model (STM):  After determining the optimal number 
of topics, the next crucial step is to estimate the STM. This process involves using 
various functions to assess, comprehend, and visualize the fitted model object. One 
key advantage of STM is its ability to incorporat e metadata into the topic modeling 
framework, enhancing the analysis in two ways:  
 
• topical prevalence:  Metadata covariates for topical prevalence enable the 
observed metadata to influence how frequently a topic is discussed.  
• topical content:  Covariates in topical content allow the observed metadata to 
affect the rate of word usage within a specific topic, shaping how that topic is 
discussed.  
 
When running the STM model, multiple arguments will be used, including the output from the 
prepDocuments  () function, which provides a documents column, a vocab column, and a meta 
column. The number of topics (K) identified using the ""searchK"" function will also be specified. 
Additionally, the ""init.type"" will be set to ""Spectral."" Lastly, the ""prevalence"" a rgument will be  
Page 7:
 
Page. 7  
 utilized to specify the metadata variables of interest as covariates, represented as an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and ""ndd_lvl.""  
 
6. Interpreting STM model results:  Once a suitable model has been chosen, the next 
crucial step involves interpreting the results. There are various methods to explore the 
output and gain insights from the STM model. The stm package provides several 
options to investigate and analyse the m odel's outcomes:  
 
• Displaying words associated with Topics : The “labelTopics”  function, along 
with the plot method for 'STM' objects (with the argument type = ""labels""), and the 
“sageLabels”  function (with the plot method for 'STM' objects, using the argument 
type = ""perspectives""), allow users to view the words closely associated with each 
topic. Additionally, the “findThoughts”  and “plotQuote”  functions are useful for 
identifying documents that have strong associations with specific topics.  
• Estimating relationships between Metadata and Topics:  The “estimateEffect”  
function can be employed to estimate the relationships between metadata 
variables and topics, as well as the topical content. This facilitates understanding 
how certain metadata covariates influence the prevalence and content of different 
topics.  
• Calculating Topic Correlations:  To measure the correlations between different 
topics, the “topicCorr”  function can be utilized, providing valuable insights into 
the relationships between various topics within the model.  
 
7. Shiny Application for inspecting STM results:  The “stminsights”  package in R 
enables interactive validation, interpretation, and visualization of one or several 
Structural Topic Models (STM).  
 
8. Stupid Back -off (SBO) model  – The “sbo” package in R will be used using the N -
gram model to build a predictive model that will take space -time stamp  and stress 
conditions to predict the next word(s).  
Results  
 
I.Determining the number of topics  
 
To identify the optimal number of topics for the analysis, the searchK function from the STM 
package in R will be utilized. This function takes several arguments, including the output from 
the prepDocuments() function. The number of topics (K) will be expl ored in the range of 30 to 
100. Additionally, the ""init.type"" parameter will be set to ""Spectral"" to improve the initialization 
process. Furthermore, the ""prevalence"" argument will be specified, allowing for the inclusion of 
metadata variables as covariate s, represented as an interaction between ""thi_lvl"" and 
""ndd_lvl."" This data -driven approach will help determine the most appropriate number of topics 
to be used by comparing the exclusivity and sematic scores between topics in the subsequent 
analysis.  
 
The results presented in Figure A showcase four key metrics used to assess the model 
quality: held -out likelihood, residual dispersion, topic semantic coherence, and the 
Page 8:
 
Page. 8  
 approximation to the lower -bound of the marginal likelihood. The objective is to maximize the 
held-out likelihood, semantic coherence, and lower -bound while minimizing the dispersion of 
residuals. These metrics collectively aid in determining the most reli able and robust model for 
the analysis.  
 
Figure A: Diagnostic Values for STM Model  (Sequence of Topics 30 -100) 
 
 
 
To evaluate the strength of the modelled topics and choose the appropriate number of topics 
for the analysis, we refer to Figure A.1, which displays a comparison of different STM models 
with varying numbers of topics. Models with K = 30 and K = 40 exhibit a narrower spread of 
topics towards the right side, and both models contain some topics that are considered 
outliers. On the other hand, models with K = 80 and K = 90 show a more favorable spread of 
topics towards the right, indicating a better distribution. Among these models, model 90 stands 
out, as it contains numerous topics with high exclusivity and semantic scores, making it the 
most suitable choice for further analysis.

II.Interpreting the STM by plotting and inspecting res ults 
 
After selecting the appropriate model with the desired number of topics, the next crucial step is 
to interpret the results of the STM model. The ""stm"" package offers several functions to 
explore the model's outcomes effectively. One such approach is to examine collections of 
words associated with each topic using the ""labelTopics"" function. Figure A.2 ill ustrates a 
sample output of the STM model, presenting four types of word weightings:  
 
• Highest Probability : This includes words within each topic with the highest probability, 
directly inferred from the topic -word distribution parameter β.  
• FREX:  Words are weighted based on their overall frequency and their exclusivity to the 
topic.  
• Lift: Words are weighted by dividing their frequency in the current topic by their 
frequency in other topics, giving higher weight to words that appear less frequently in 
other topics.  
• Score:  This weighting divides the log frequency of the word in the current topic by the 
log frequency of the word in other topics.  
 
It is advisable to prioritize using FREX words as they highlight words that carry significant 
weight and are unique to each topic. As evident in Figure A.2, Topic 22 is associated with 
farmers seeking information on grazing and breeds through the iShamba p latform, while Topic 
3 and Topic 47 both lack any coherent association with a specific topic. Additionally, Topic 68 
Page 10:
 
Page. 10  
 discusses harvest -related matters, and Topic 83 focuses on farmers seeking advice and 
assistance from the iShamba platform regarding farming activities.  
 
Figure A .2: Example of the output of STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
 
Another valuable approach is to estimate the relationships between metadata and topics using 
the ""estimateEffect""  function. These relationships play a crucial role in validating the topic 
model's effectiveness (Grimmer 2010; Grimmer and Stewart 2013). This function performs 
regression, treating documents as the units, the proportion of each document about a topic in 
an STM model as the outcome, and document metadata as covariates. The method of 
composition is used to incorporate measurement uncertainty from the STM model. The 
""estimateEffect""  function requires several arguments, including the formula representing an 
interaction between ""thi_lvl""  and "" ndd_lvl"",  the output of the STM model, and the metadata. 
The ""uncertainty""  parameter is set to ""Global""  by default, which considers the estimation 
uncertainty of topic proportions in the uncertainty estimates using the method of composition. 
Alternatively, users can choose ""None""  for uncertainty if they do not wish to propagate the full 
amount of uncertainty, which might result in narrower confidence intervals due to the exclusion 
of additional estimation uncertainty. When calling ""summary"" on the ""estimateEffect""  object, a 
regression table (Roberts, Margaret E., Brandon M. Stewart, and Dustin Tingley 2019) will be 
generated, providing valuable insights into the relationships between metadata and topics.  
 
The proportion of the data that is yes/no from 71,105 observations is as follows:  
 
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl  are both “yes” – 26,315 observations.  
• thi_lvl and ndd_lvl are both “no” – 4,265 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “yes” and ndd_lvl is “no” – 9,451 observations.  
• thi_lvl is “no” and ndd_lvl is “yes” – 31,074 observations.  
Page 11:
 
Page. 11  
  
Table 1 presents the outcomes derived from the ""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 3, 22, 47, 
68, and 83. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific topic, outlining associated terms, 
their respective estimates, standard errors, and p -values. The i ntercept in the table signifies 
instances where both THI and NDD stress levels are categorized as ""no stress."" Notably, this 
intercept remains statistically significant across all 90 topics.  
 
A broad interpretation of the model suggests that when comparing the intercept, symbolizing 
""no stress,"" to scenarios where THI and NDD indicate stress levels, the model tends to 
generate a list of more generic words and topics. This outcome is likely due to the climate 
conditions being categorized as ""no stress,"" indicating that farmers are less concerned about 
weather's impact on their agricultural activities.  
 
It's important to highlight that the model's output doesn't reveal any terms related to livestock 
or weather, indicating that the model is not performing as expected.  
 
 
      Signif . codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1  
            Intercept here is defined as THI and NDD = “no stress”  
 
To explore the depth of the relationship between SMSs and topics, the ""findThoughts""  function 
is employed. Figure A.3 presents the top five SMSs associated with Topics 3, 22, and 47. 
Observing Figure A.3, it becomes evident that the received SMSs pertain to various queries 
without specific relevance to livestock or livestock feed crops. I t can be inferred that this 
interaction model did not yield the anticipated outcomes, as the associated words with topics

 seemed random and lacked the specificity needed to discern the nature of livestock -related 
inquiries that farmers seek from the iShamba platform.  
 
 
 
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the types of queries sent by 
livestock farmers to the iShamba platform and to enhance the platform's advisory capabilities 
based on the findings from this analysis. The interaction regression model yielded words that 
were associated with the ""no stress"" category. This outcome can be attributed to the simplified 
model, where classes of THI and N DD were simplified, leading the model to recognize words 
related to the ""no stress"" scenario.  
 
Shifting the focus away from the interaction model between THI and NDD, we proceeded to 
conduct separate regression analyses for THI and NDD. To facilitate this, both covariates were 
reverted to their original categorical forms:  
 
• For “ thi”:2 
• THI_mean <= 72 categorized  as ""no stress""  
• THI_mean <= 78 categorized as ""mild stress""  
• THI_mean  <= 89 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
 
• For “ndd”:  
• NDD_mean < 15 categorized as ""no stress""

 • NDD_mean < 20 categorized as ""moderate stress""  
• NDD_mean < 25 categorized as ""severe stress""  
• NDD_mean >= 25 categorized as ""extreme stress""  
 
 
Upon a more in-depth analysis of the data, a significant pattern has emerged. SMSs flagged 
with ""mild"" and ""moderate"" stress levels for THI collectively constitute 50.27% of the dataset. 
In contrast, for NDD, SMSs indicated as having ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and ""extreme "" stress 
levels make up a substantial portion, accounting for a total of 80.77% of the data. Notably, THI 
shows no distinct disparity between ""no stress"" and stress levels. Additionally, it's important to 
highlight that the THI data lacks instances of ""sev ere"" stress.  
 
The probability of selecting an SMS labeled with ""no stress"" as compared to stress levels 
labeled ""mild"" or ""moderate"" for THI stands at 50%. Due to this equal distribution, it becomes 
challenging for the THI model to effectively discern stress -related key words.  
 
In contrast, the prevalence of stress levels, encompassing ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and 
""extreme,"" is notably higher with NDD. Stress levels make up 80.77% of the data, whereas ""no 
stress"" levels constitute only 19.23%. Consequently, the NDD model is anticipa ted to 
effectively identify stress -related words and topics. Therefore, the subsequent ""estimateEffect"" 
results concentrate on scenarios where NDD serves as the covariate.  
 
The same STM model logic was applied to the NDD model, but this time the model had only 
one covariate with the four classes of NDD mentioned above. The searchK function was 
executed to determine the appropriate number of topics, and it also yielded K = 90,  indicating 
a more favorable distribution of topics towards the right side. This distribution suggests a 
better overall topic coverage. Figure A.4 below displays the outcomes of the STM model for 
NDD. Notably, this model generated more words that are close ly related to livestock or 
livestock feed.  
 
For instance, the “labelTopics” plot below , Topic 43 delves into crops such as millet, cassava, 
and peas that could be used for feeding livestock. On the other hand, Topic 63 addresses 
pesticide control for crops, which affects the well -being of livestock . Furthermore, Topic 48 
touches upon financial aspects, indicating that farmers might seek loans for their farms or 
intend to purchase more livestock. Meanwhile, Topic 58 addresses farmers' concerns about 
climate change and the prevailing conditions that m ay impact their farming activities in the 
present and future.

 Figure A.4: Example of the output of NDD STM Model with 90 topics  
 
 
 
Table 2, presented below, displays the regression outcomes derived from the NDD 
""estimateEffect"" function for Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. The intercept within the table signifies 
the context where NDD stress level is classified as ""extreme stress."" Importantly, this intercept 
exhibits statistical significance across all 90 topics.  
 
Interpreting the model's outcomes reveals that for Topics 43 and 63, any incremental 
alteration in NDD stress levels classified as ""extreme stress"" elicits a shift in farmers' concerns 
towards crop -related issues and pesticide control. This alignment is ob servable in Figure A.4.  
 
As NDD conditions become more severe, observed through the significance of ""severe stress"" 
in Topic 58 at a 0.001 significance level, an increase of -0.0010 in NDD stress level appears to 
prompt farmers' apprehensions about climate conditions and their potential impact on farming 
activities. This prompts them to seek guidance from the iShamba platform before conditions 
escalate to the level of “extreme stress”.

To delve further into the intricacies of the relationship between SMSs and topics, Figure A.5 
showcases the top four SMSs associated with Topics 43, 48, 58, and 63. It can be observed 
that the SMSs from farmers exhibit a strong correlation with topics related to livestock, climate, 
pesticides, and crops. However, it's important to note that this mo del also generated topics 
with seemingly random and basic words that are not inherently connected to livestock. This 
might be attributed to the presence of noise within the dataset, introducing some level of 
uncertainty.

To explore deeper into the results of the Estimateeffect model, we specifically focused on 
topics where a distinct difference was evident between the intercept (extreme stress) and no 
stress. This analysis led to the identification of approximately 52 such  topics. For each of these 
topics, we utilized the findthoughts function to extract 100 SMSs, resulting in a total of 5200 
observations.  
 
From these 5200 SMSs, we associated them with the corresponding wards by referencing the 
original dataset. Astonishingly, only 83 unique wards were represented out of the total 1450 
wards in the complete dataset.  
 
Further filtering was applied to isolate SMSs inquiring about climate, rain, and weather. This 
refinement resulted in 277 observations. Among these, 82 unique wards were found to have 
sent climate -related queries to the iShamba platform.

The effective and efficient water resource conservation and management necessary to mitigate the crisis requires monitoring data, especially on water quality. This is recognized by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, particularly indicator 6.3.2., which requires all UN member states to measure and report the ‘proportion of water bodies with good ambient water quality’. However, gathering sufficient data on water quality is reliant on data collection at spatial and temporal scales that are generally outside the capacity of institutions using conventional methods. Digital technologies, such as wireless sensor networks and remote sensing, have come to the fore as promising avenues to increase the scope of data collection and reporting. Citizen science (which goes by many names, e.g., participatory science or community-based monitoring) has also been earmarked as a powerful mechanism to improve monitoring. However, both avenues have drawbacks and limitations. The synergy between the strengths of modern technologies and citizen science presents an opportunity to use the best features of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the other. This paper briefly synthesizes recent research illustrating how smartphones, sometimes in conjunction with other sensors, present a nexus point method for citizen scientists to engage with and use sophisticated modern technology for water quality monitoring. This paper also presents a brief, non-exhaustive research synthesis of some examples of current technological upgrades or innovations regarding smartphones in citizen science water quality monitoring in developing countries and how these can assist in objective, comprehensive, and improved data collection, management and reporting. While digital innovations are being rapidly developed worldwide, there remains a paucity of scientific and socioeconomic validation of their suitability and usefulness within citizen science. This perhaps contributes to the fact that the uptake and upscaling of smartphone-assisted citizen science continues to underperform compared to its potential within water resource management and SDG reporting. Ultimately, we recommend that more rigorous scientific research efforts be dedicated to exploring the suitability of digital innovations in citizen science in the context of developing countries and SDG reporting.

1. Background  
Natural  systems are  inherently  complex  webs  of interconnected 
components that encompass environment, ecosystems, and 
numerous earth system processes operating at scales. Human 
activities and their iterations with these systems make them 
more complex leading to several intended and unintended 
consequences with dynamic feedback loops. While these 
complexities have always existed, these have increased due to 
the recent  technological  explosion  (Sargut  and McGrath,  2011). 
As averred by Sargut and McGrath (2011), the complexity has 
gone from something found in large confined systems, such as 
factories  and cities, to remote environments  such as entire river 
basins. The non -linear effects and dynamic feedback loops  from the natural systems and their human interactions are 
making it harder to predict what will happen because they 
interact  in unexpected ways  and are difficult  to manage.  This is 
especially true where reliable data are not easily accessible.  
River basins are complex natural systems where human 
activities imparted profound influence on water, land, 
ecosystems, and climate patterns. There is no doubt that the 
management of the water resources of a basin is a complex 
issue due to the inherent interplay  of the changing environment 
(Bernhardt et al., 2006; Cosgrove and Loucks, 2015; Leb et  al., 
2018; Young and Harshadeep, 2020). River basin ecosystems 
provide  water  resources  for agriculture,  livestock,  and fisheries, 
industry and for domestic use, sustaining the livelihoods of

Figure  1 A simple  representation  of Digital  Twin  (Jones  et al., 2020)  
 
millions  of people  in the region.  Nonetheless,  these  river  basin 
ecosystems are also subject to hydroclimatic extremes, land 
degradation, poor water quality, urbanization and population 
growth. These environmental shifts not only pose a threat to 
the rich biodiversity in river basins but also weaken the 
resilience of local communities to climate change (Fazey et  
al., 2021; Carmen et al, 2022).  
To effectively manage these complex natural systems 
impacted by human activities, there is a need to leverage 
technological advancements such as high -performance 
computing,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  and real-time database 
management  systems.  The DT concept  is an advanced  version 
of traditional Decision Support Systems (DSS) used to 
manage water resources and environmental processes in river 
basin ecosystems. By utilizing new generation sensors, big 
data, cloud processing and AI, a digital representation of the 
river basin is created, providing a dynamic framework that 
offers comprehensive information for effective management.  
A DT is a rapidly emerging concept that digitally depicts an 
object, a process, or a system (Grieves, 2014; Ademenko et  
al., 2020 and references therein). Grieves and Vickers (2004) 
pioneered the work of DT and presented a DT framework as 
comprising three components, a physical object, a digital 
representation of that object, and the bi -directional data 
connections that feed data from the physical to the digital 
representation, and information and processes from  the digital 
representation  to the physical  (Figure  1). DT has the capability 
of accelerating innovation (e.g., improved modelling of  
system changes or optimized business supply chains) if 
coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT) or AI (Jones et al., 
2020).  
A review  of DT literature by  Jones  et al. (2020)  demonstrated 
increased interest in recent years across both academia and 
industry as seen in the growth in the number of related 
publications,  processes,  concepts,  and envisaged  benefits.  In a 
bid to determine if DT could be used in the Nature -based 
Solutions (NbS) for stormwater and transboundary water  security projects, the existing conceptual challenges and the 
DT definition as a framework were examined (Brasil et al., 
2022). They identified how the mathematical modelling 
reported in the literature could improve the DT development, 
and evaluated the potential benefits associated with the 
application of DT in NbS. Noting the sparse presence of DT 
applications in water resource management and in particular 
river basin management, the present review aims to a)  
establish the role of AI techniques such as machine learning, 
deep learning, and data analytics in enhancing the predictive 
and decision -making capabilities of digital twins, b) compile 
information about existing DT applications in developing 
countries,  c) assess  the DT infrastructure,  architecture  and data 
governance frameworks, and d) characterize the relevant DT 
use cases for river basin management. This review contributes 
towards developing a robust conceptual framework for an 
operational Limpopo River Basin DT.  
2. Literature  Review  
The era of digital technologies capable of transforming the 
livelihoods of developing country populace is now more 
obvious. Yet the inherent core pillars including the digital 
infrastructure, human capital and enabling environment, 
continue to act as impediments to these countries’ massive 
digital ecosystem potential that is hugely needed for socio - 
economic equitable growth (Union, 2020). Juxtaposing the 
role that water sensitive sectors  play in support  of advancing 
economic  growth,  socio - and gender  equity  and creating  jobs 
under changing climate, this underscores the value of  digital 
innovation ecosystem in the context of water resource

Figure 3 Trends of research themes. Upper -right quadrant are the motor themes (hot topics); themes appearing in the  upper -left quadrant are considered very spe - 
cialized  topics -niche  themes;  the lower  right  are termed basic  themes;  emerging  or declining  themes  are generally  weakly  developed,  have  low density,  low central - 
ity and are either emerging or disappearing.  
 
Fortunately,  our world  is abuzz  with disruptive  technologies 
that are transforming  the way  we respond to the  present  and 
future challenges. The digital transformation strategy for 
Africa (2020 -2030), avers that;  
“Africa presents a sea of economic opportunities in 
virtually every sector, and the continent’s youthful 
population structure is an enormous opportunity in 
this digital  era and hence  the need  for Africa  to make 
digitally  enabled  socio -economic  development  a high 
priority.”  
Against  the backdrop  of the digital  transformation  strategy  for 
Africa, there is need to ameliorate the unique challenges of 
adoption of digital technologies across Africa. There is no 
doubt that the new technologies and approaches for 
digitalizing and smartening water systems through Big Data, 
algorithm  development  and Artificial  Intelligence  (using  Deep  & Machine Learning) are increasingly being recognized 
globally. While Digital Agriculture & Digital Water 
Innovations (hereafter DA -DW-I) have a global footprint, 
arguments  for their impact  and developmental  implications  are 
generally subtle in the global South (e.g., Amankwa et al., 
2021).

Figure  4 Content  analysis  of Digital  Twin  scholarship  in Africa  (Source:  Authors)  
 
Peer-reviewed published literature on DT and river basin 
management in scientific databases (e.g., Scopus and Web of 
Science (WoS)), illustrates that the global DT scholarship on 
river basin management is generally a nascent research  
agenda. This evidence is illustrated by more than 12 years of 
publications given in Figure 2, wherein the majority of the 
scientific  articles  focusing  on DT only emerge  in the past three 
years. There were 41 peer -reviewed scientific publications on  
 
Table  2 Nature  of country  collaboration  on the DT publications  in Africa  DT with river basin references. In terms of the research 
interests across countries, the review analysis suggests that 
China  and South  African  researchers  are at the forefront,  albeit 
surprisingly lacking collaboration as most publications focus 
on single country (Table 1). In terms of emerging themes in  
the DT research domain, the review established that there are 
subtle hot topics (upper right), very specialized (upper left) as 
well as basic (lower right) and emerging (lower left) research 
themes as depicted in  Figure 3. The evolution of the research 
themes from a global perspective is expected to change as the 
direction of DT scholarship changes in future.  
In reviewing published literature on DT in Africa, few key 
words were used i.e., “Digital Twin” and “Africa” and the 
search kept to “within” abstracts only.  Only nineteen articles 
(17 from Scopus and 2 from WoS) were extracted that had 
some  content  on DT. A quick  analysis  of the trends,  and social

networks of the DT scholarship illustrated that the scientific 
discourse only emerged in databases considered from 2018 
(only one article) with most articles published in 2023 (7 
seven  articles).  Seven  peer reviewed  scientific  publications  on 
DT (where river basin management is also mentioned) were 
published between 2020 and 2022. The composition of the 
article types illustrated that most of the DT research has 
mostly  appeared  in scientific  conferences,  while  five, two, and 
four appeared in Journals, Book Chapters and Reviews 
respectively.  The nature of publication collaborations by 
country, Table 2, illustrates that DT scholars from South 
Africa and the United Kingdom exhibit both single and 
multiple country publications while France, Germany and 
Morocco have single country publications. To understand the 
research direction or applications of DT in Africa, Figure 4 
shows the content analysis of abstracts of the 17 reviewed 
articles. Though research on DT in the African continent is 
still at it’s infancy, content analysis results of the reviewed 
articles given in Figure 4 bring forth three main research 
directions,  i.e., methodology, applications  and use. It however 
important to note that these results are not exhaustive at this 
stage.  
Smart City  and Digital Twin City  are new novel methods of 
city management  being  implemented  worldwide,  in response 
to the expansion  of cities  and megacities  in the current  era of technology  disruption,  rapid  urbanization  and climate  change. 
For instance, in 2021, the University of Pretoria announced 
the creation of Hatfield Digital Twin City, a novel initiative  
that aims to boost service delivery with the help of smart 
technology (Figure 5).  
A literature  search  of smart  city applications  of DT in  the 
African continent resulted to only the following notable 
publications:  
a) Nigerian  Electricity  Supply  Industry  (NESI): Aliyu et  al. 
(2021)  analyzed  the NESI  framework  and concluded  that 
the system uses a novel framework that is premised on a 
SoS and digital twins.  
b) Broekman  and Steyn  (2022)  reported  on Digital  Twinning 
of Lap -based Marathon Infrastructure: the digitization of 
the marathon route using Real -Time Kinematic Global 
Navigation Satellite Systems (RTK GNSS) and high - 
density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensing 
capabilities to allow for the detailed geometry 
measurements and environmental analysis before and  
after such events. They concluded that the intersection of 
engineering and sports disciplines and technology 
illustrates the potential realization of smart cities and 
recreation in an evolutionary society.

South Africa.  
3. Digital  Twins  and Virtual  Reality  
In the rapidly advancing technological era we inhabit,  it is 
advantageous to critically evaluate the functionalities and 
applicability  of immersive and interactive digital technologies 
such as Virtual  Reality  (VR)  to sectors  which  impact  our well- 
being and quality of life in sectors such as agriculture and 
water management. Furthermore, it is important to explore 
how these  emergent  technologies  like VR can shape  and guide  decision making in water resources management, aid in risk 
management  and accelerate  technology  usage.  This will result 
in the generation of innovative technology -based solutions 
toward solving river basin challenges to ameliorate humanity 
and the sustainability of food and water resources.  
Gigante (1993) defines VR as being “characterized by the 
illusion of participation in a synthetic environment than 
external  observation  of such an environment.  It relies  on three - 
dimensional, stereoscopic, head -tracked displays, hand/body 
tracking, and binaural sound”. Additionally, VR may be 
delineated as an immersive, multisensory experience ( Holuša, 
et al., 2023; Azarby, & Rice, 2022). It is also referred to as 
providing virtual environments, virtual worlds, or 
microworlds. A journal titled, Development of a Digital Twin 
for smart farming: Irrigation management system for water  
Page 7:
WORKING  PAPER  
CGIAR  Initiative  on Digital  Innovation  | on.cgiar.org/digital  
7  
 saving  asserts  that the “digital  twin applied  to agriculture  is in 
its early stages of development”. It further defines a digital 
twin as an entity where “data flows automatically and in both 
directions between a physical object and a virtual  
object” (Alves, Maia & Lima, 2023). It is imperative to note 
that the adoption of these technologies is in an experimental 
phase and the consolidation of two or more technologies such 
as DT and VR is an even more recently employed practice. A 
literature  review  on the linkages  between  VR and DT revealed 
an interesting pattern of these two concepts. The concepts of 
VR and DT seems to have appeared only in the last two 
decades  (based  on the Scopus  and WoS  databases).  According 
to the two databases, 857 articles (comprising of largely 
journal articles -50%; and conference papers -25%). Most of  
the scholarship only emerged post -2018. In terms of the 
linkages between DT, VR and Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Figure  6 illustrates  detailed  interconnections  between  the three 
concepts and other antecedent terminologies. As shown in 
Figure 6, there are intrinsic interlinkages between these three 
concepts  and other  concepts  such as data analytics,  augmented 
reality, machine learning – all related to advanced 
computational techniques.  
There are a host of possibilities for the application of 
technologies such as DT and VR to actively address water 
management concerns specific to river basins in developing 
African  countries.  The unique  characteristics  DT and VR offer 
respectively  and when  combined provide  useful  real-time data 
to allow  for the continuous monitoring of river basins. Firstly, 
DT and VR offer accessible realistic digital visualizations 
which enable integrated river basin modelling. While DT 
establishes a real -time virtual representation of the river basin 
presenting water flow, dam operations, pollution sources and 
other environmental elements, VR allows for the visual 
navigation of the DT model and permits interactivity where 
users may directly impact the virtual environment they are 
visiting using their senses including sight, touch, smell and 
hearing to observe the real -time condition of river basins.  
River basins play a pivotal role in supplying fresh water and 
regulating water flow and quality. A DT and VR 
collaboratively  may be used to monitor the physical condition 
of the river basins. The DT will provide the data analytics 
required while VR will allow scientists and engineers to 
conduct virtual inspections and assessments eliminating the 
need for them to be physically present. Lastly, in the case of 
water  crises  such as droughts  or floods  the data extracted  from  the DT can  be analysed  to predict  heavy  rainfalls  that may 
cause  floods  or increased  evapotranspiration  and the over- 
extraction of ground water that may cause droughts.  
Concurrently,  VR can be employed  to pre-visualize  droughts 
and floods  before  they occur  to implement  prevention  tactics 
or mitigate the impact if inevitable.  
An exemplary  case study where DT and VR has been  utilized 
cooperatively  to combat  agricultural  related  challenges  can be 
seen through AgroIT, a company that provides technological 
solutions for the agricultural sector, particularly focusing on 
precision agriculture. AgroIT's platform uses Digital Twin 
technology to create a virtual representation of farmlands, 
incorporating data like soil conditions, weather, and crop 
health. On the VR front, they have explored its use for 
visualizing these digital farms. This combination allows 
farmers to virtually 'walk' through their fields, visualize 
potential problem areas, and make informed decisions about 
irrigation, fertilization and other operations1. 
The ambitions  of DT and VR for environmental  application in 
developing countries based on its previous uses are to aid in 
water resource management systems. This one day may be as 
advanced as integrated user interfaces. Virtual reality is also 
known as an ‘empathy machine’ because of its unique ability 
to immerse users in emotionally charged perspectives, 
experiences, and environments which may prompt positive 
actions  and behaviors  in real life. Through  the advancement  of 
brain -computer interfaces users might control DT simulations 
or navigate VR environments using their thoughts. This could 
lead to more intuitive user experiences and might even allow 
for emotion -driven simulations, where users can ""feel"" the 
impacts of different river management decisions. DT and VR 
technologies strategically locate themselves at the heart of 
digital innovation as solution -based methods that directly 
address the need for visual representations to accurately 
measure the state of water, food and land conditions within 
various  regions  susceptible to food and water wastage, natural 
disasters and shortages. Researchers and scientists look 
forward to the progression of these technologies and the 
problems they will solve in the water management sector. A 
consideration of the manner we orient and define DT and VR 
as their operations evolve and their capacity expands will be 
essential to the integration and assimilation of these ever - 
changing digital innovations.

4. Stakeholder  Needs  Assessment  
DT models are anchored on data from various life cycle 
phases that ought to be collected and analyzed to deliver 
services to a myriad of stakeholders. The utility of the DT 
services is dependent on the level of alignment with 
stakeholder needs. In order ensure uptake of the DT services, 
there  is need  to undertake  stakeholder  engagement  through  the 
development phases of the DT design and implementation.  
Stakeholders are defined as all groups and individuals who 
influence the aims of an organization, project or product and 
vice versa (Freeman and McVea, 2005). As part of  
stakeholder analysis, the stakeholders, their interests and their 
characteristics are identified. This is followed by clustering 
and prioritization  of the stakeholders.  After  analysis,  a strategy 
and recommended actions can be defined (Ramirez, 1999).  
From the DT design and implementation perspective, a 
stakeholder typology reported in Mitchael et al., (1997) as 
well as stakeholder identification based on the interest - 
influence matrix  reported in  e.g., Janssens  de Bisthoven  et al., 
(2022) should be considered. All the DT use cases relevant to 
river -based  management  presented  in Section  7.2, undertook  a 
well-designed iterative stakeholder engagement process  
during the design and implementation of the DT.  
5. 3D Representation  of a River  Basin  Digital 
Twin  
The emergence  of digital  twin technology  has revolutionized 
several fields,  from  manufacturing  to urban  planning  (Tao  et 
al., 2018).  The application  of this innovative  concept  to river basin management using the 3D Representation provides a 
compelling overview of the potential benefits and challenges 
faced.  A river  basin,  being  a complex  system  with a myriad of 
interrelated components such as water flow, sediment 
transport, vegetation, and human interventions, necessitates a 
robust modeling approach. The three -dimensional 
representation in the mentioned work provides a vivid and 
detailed visualization of these elements, making it an 
invaluable tool for stakeholders.  
6. Data  Infrastructure  Architecture  for a Digital 
Twin  
The envisioned  DT architecture  is often  characterized  by two 
main  typologies  - monitoring  and predictive  DT as  described 
in Figure 7. The monitoring typology  represents the past and 
present dynamics of the physical and social -economic 
properties and interactions with the hydroclimatic 
environment, where a virtual representation is created using 
this data. From the perspective of predictive typology, 
predictive models will use past and present data to create a 
plausible future rendition of the present state of the 
environment.  
As reported  in Brasil  et al. (2022)  and Dhulipala  (2021),  a DT 
conceptual framework comprises the components briefly 
described below (also see Figure 8):  
a) Data  source  layer:  to accurately  represent  the LRB  in a 
digital space, various data sets will be required. These 
data sets ought to represent not only the physical

Figure  8 The physical  environment,  data storage,  digital  environment  and applications  services  of the Digital  Twin  (Adapted  from  Brasil  et al., 2022)  
 
environment but also the biological and chemical 
conditions of the basin. Some of the data sources may 
include, remotely sensed data -from satellites and/or 
drones, hydrological process model data, ground 
observations (e.g., water quality/proxy measurements, 
weather  data,  mobile  app captured  data sets),  and thirty 
party datasets which are often analysis ready (e.g., 
climatic data from  the Digital Earth Africa platform  or 
non-climatic datasets  from  the National Department of 
Statistics).  
b) Data processing layer: One of the key functions of this 
layer is to pre -process and format the various data sets to 
ensure inter -operability among the various strands of the 
data. In addition, this layer executes a set of data 
modelling functions including hydrological process 
modelling, climate data downscaling and bias correction, 
satellite image classing to derive various product 
including  hydroclimatic  extremes  and irrigated  area maps.  
c) Data visualization and analytic layer: Based on the 
outputs  in b), this layer  comprises  GIS-enabled  analytic  tools embedded with dashboards to display various user 
selected features. Some of the key  outputs from  this layer 
would be the early warning messages that denote 
hydroclimatic  extremes,  risk areas  and the general  state of 
the river basin.  
d) Advisory and dissemination layer: this layer is a rule 
engine  embedded  decision  support  rule system  that helps 
provide intelligent management options suited for the 
present  and future  physical  state of the river  basin.  These 
decisions are often disseminated using channels such as 
SMS/USSD, web and mobile applications, and even 
tower broadcasts once the system is implemented.  
7. Digital  Twin Data  Governance Framework  
At the heart of the DT, is the data collection, curation, 
management, analysis as well as output of data (Figure 8). 
Since  DT information  can be viewed  as the high-end utility  of 
all the data sets, a strong  data foundation  is necessary.  To this 
end, a robust data foundation is underpinned by a strong data 
governance2 and data management3 strategy (see Plotkin,  
 
 
 
2 Data  governance  is the formal  oversight,  execution  and enforcement  of authority  over the management  of data. 
3 Data  management  is the effective  management  of data to achieve  goals  i.e. it ensures  that an organization  gets value  out of its data while  minimizing  operating  risk.

Figure  9 Data  domains  (Source:  Khatri  and Brown,  2010)  
 
2020;  Conarado,  2014).  In the context  of DT, the four decision 
domains of data governance reported in Khatri and Brown, 
(2010) are appropriate. Thus, a data governance framework 
could comprise; a) data principles (at the top) which are 
intended to establish the direction for all other decision 
domains, and set the boundary requirements for uses of data 
assets, thereby addressing standards for data quality; b) the 
data quality then determines how data are interpreted 
(metadata) as well as accessed (data access) by users; and c) 
the data life -cycle decision which defines the production, 
retention and retirement of data assets (Alhassan et al., 2016).  
The aim of the DT for river basin management could be seen 
as the exhaustive capture of all physical environment 
parameters which are often intrinsically linked to aspects of 
people's  lives, and intellectual property. Determining how  this 
information is shared between organizations and individuals 
will naturally require some data sharing policy (Jones et al., 
2020).  This even  more  so when  referring  to both physical  and 
virtual  entities - to what  extent  does DT data ownership  go? As 
a result, the question  of ownership encompasses who accesses 
the data and for what purpose. As reported in Jones et. al., 
(2020), there are social and cultural implications associated 
with the large -scale collection, storage, and sharing of data 
through the Digital Twin that need to be fully addressed 
through a data governance framework.  
While co -designed data governance framework could 
accelerate  access  and use of data and services  of the DT, the 
following key challenges ought to be overcome;  a) Cataloguing  for all the available  data collected  by 
separate  and distinct  scientists  and/or  institutions,  
b) Understanding  the data in the proper  context  and the need 
to link similar data sets together,  
c) Akin to many sectors such as financial services, retail, 
and healthcare companies, there may be a lack of 
resources  (e.g.,  data stewards)  to curate  and maintain  the 
quality of the data.  
 
8. Digital  Twin  for River  Basins Applications  
8.1. Digital  Twin  for decision  making  at the river  basin - 
level 
The utility  of DT applications  at basin  level  lies in the inherent 
adaptive capability wherein the near -real time river basin 
processes will be captured. As a result, any reactive measures 
(including  plausible  futures)  lead to improved  efficiency  of the 
basin operations, optimized uncertainty measures, early 
warning  detection  and generally  good  emergency  management 
(Pal et al., 2023). These salient features are supported by 
embedding AI algorithms with the DT architecture. The AI  
has the capability of providing additional insights beyond  
what the sensors provide t","10395"

2MILESTONES ACHIEVED
Project Launch:
The project officially began on July 1, 2023, with the signing of the funding 
agreement.
The second phase aimed to lay the groundwork for successful project 
implementation. The project’s scope and objectives were meticulously defined during this phase through extensive discussions.
Stakeholder Engagement: 
Key stakeholders, including local partners and relevant authorities, were identified and engaged in the planning process.
Project Scope & field assessment: 
The project was geographically focused on the West Showa Zone, specifically in the Wolmera and Ejere woredas, indicating a localized and targeted approach.
The HER+ Initiative involved an in-depth field assessment of various aspects 
of agriculture in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. The findings revealed the predominant cultivation of a variety of vegetables by women farmers, guided by well-documented cropping calendars and varied productivity. Agricultural practices encompassed soil preparation, seed selection, irrigation, and effective 
input utilization, as well as livestock management and marketing strategies. The 
accessibility and affordability of agricultural inputs, extension services, market services, post-harvest technologies, and financial services exhibited variations between the woredas. Despite challenges, women played pivotal roles in different 
stages of vegetable production. These insights are pivotal for informed decision-
making, facilitating targeted interventions to promote agricultural sustainability and gender equity in the region. Notably, farmers with access to SNV assistance showed significant improvements in various aspects of vegetable production compared to others.
Targeted Farmers: The project aimed to register over 5,000 farmers, focusing 
on women farmers, in the West Showa Zone, specifically in Wolmera and Ejere woredas. This implies a significant outreach effort to include a large portion of the farming community.

Input Procurement: The registered farmers could conveniently procure 
essential agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides through digital platforms. This can streamline the supply chain, making inputs more 
accessible and cost-effective.
Lersha Agents Training” was delivered at the Green Agro-Solution (GAS) 
office from September 25-26, 2023. The training aimed to refresh and enhance the information and skills of the potential Lersha agents in various areas, 
including agronomy, livestock production, Lersha application practice, and 
communication, entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, gender, and onboarding steps. The training was conducted for two consecutive days, with 12 potential Lersha agents, of which 4 are women from two woredas and the agricultural 
office focal from SNV retailers participating. On the second day, representatives 
from the Woreda agricultural offices and agro-dealers joined the training to encourage the onboarding process. To develop engagement and participation, the training was designed with various group activities, group work, and case studies in combination with PowerPoint slides and brochures. By organizing the 
agents into groups, we encouraged discussion, collaboration, and sharing of 
perspectives and experiences.

Colombo: IWMI Permanent link to cite or share this item https://hdl.handle.net/10568/132394 External link to download this item DOI Abstract/Description Meaningfully engaging women in accessing and controlling benefits from agriculture and the broader development agenda has largely remained a source of disillusionment within the development arena. More recently, there has been an increase in the use of Multistakeholder Platforms (MSP) by several actors within CGIAR and beyond. Multistakeholder dialogues aim to ensure that there is a discussion on challenges facing communities within the different landscapes and how solutions are crafted to address the challenges through practical development interventions. This paper, firstly, engages with literature on MSPs and how gender equality and social inclusion can be made intentional by including women and youths in the processes. Secondly, through the practical implementation of the Aquatic Foods Initiative in Zambia, the actual assessments and practical implementation are being monitored and critiqued through the process documentation of MSP implementation to ensure that women and youths are included. The documentation goes beyond inclusion to document the outcomes of women and youth inclusion. Thirdly, this paper situates MSPs within the CGIAR’s MSPs’ broader community of practice to draw further common threads across different contexts, different resources and across different scales. The early findings demonstrate that it is possible to engage women and youths in the designing, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the MSPs. Such engagement needs to be intentional and must invest time and resources in ensuring that participation goes beyond attendance to informing and influencing the priorities and even going further to ensure those priorities are implemented and reflected upon.

•Meaningfully engaging women in accessing and controlling benefits from 
agriculture – illusion – mirage – years required for equality.
•Multistakeholder Platforms aim to ensure that there is a discussion of challenges 
facing communities within the different landscapes and how solutions are crafted 
to address the challenges through practical development interventions.
•Multistakeholder Platforms - how gender equality and social inclusion can be 
made intentional by including women and youths in the processes .
•Monitored and critiqued through the process documentation of MSP 
implementation to ensure that women and youths are included
•The documentation goes beyond inclusion to document the processes and 
outcomes as a result of women and youth inclusion
•Situating MSPs within the broader CGIAR’s MSPs’ Community of Practice to draw 
further common threads across different contexts, different resources and across 
different scales.

www.cgiar.orgMSP Overview (cont’d)
•Multi-stakeholders' learning platforms will catalyze at the national and sub-
national levels the evidence to include integrated systems into project 
design and policies. 
•Water-Energy-Food-Environment nexus lens
•Holisticdevelopment
Page 6:
www.cgiar.orgPrinciples for implementation
•Co-ownership of development outcomes
•Forum for genuine dialogue (gendered power dynamics)
•Gendered knowledge exchange, 
•Co-creation of knowledge (IKS, men, women, youths)
•Joint learning – across different stakeholders
•Inclusiveness (GESI)
•Stronger together – Leave No Stakeholder Behind!

www.cgiar.orgPreliminary Reflections
•Established a gender intentional functional Multi Stakeholder Platform for 
the Lower Kafue Basin – 3 October 2023 launched.
•Appropriate communication and coordination tools and channels are 
established among all the stakeholders. 
•Effective and meaningful engagement for all the key stakeholders in the 
Lower Kafue especially women, youths and the vulnerable.
•Lessons learnt from the Lower Kafue MSP implementation are being 
documented.
•Inclusive and sustainable MSP.
•Efficient conflict resolution mechanisms established.
•Increased basket of benefits being shared equitably in the Lower Kafue.
•A suite of development interventions identified, prioritized and funding 
opportunities explored.
Page 9:
www.cgiar.orgPreliminary Reflections (cont’d)
•It is possible to engage women, youths and vulnerable in the designing, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the MSPs. 
•Such engagement needs to be intentional and must invest time and 
resources in ensuring that participation goes beyond attendance to 
informing and influencing the priorities and even going further to ensure 
those priorities are implemented and reflected upon
•Dam operational rules and early warning system
•Upstream-Downstream linkages – PES
•CSR – dividends for development
•Gender specific interventions – aquaculture for women groups
Page 10:
www.cgiar.orgConclusion
•MSP participation is not absolute – it is fluid, created, challenged, modified, 
negotiated and re-configured - importance of facilitated stakeholder 
engagement.
•Arena where patriarchal norms are challenged and reconfigured.
•Move away from the stereotypes/binary powerful and less powerful (men –
women) – nuanced intersectional gradient.
•‘I participate. You participate. He participates. She participates . We 
participate. They control’ 
•MSP as a solution out of such a conundrum – translating research into 
impact

"9786","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**

The wild relatives of this crop are deemed a vast potential source of useful alleles to adapt to this stress. A nested association mapping (NAM) panel was generated using as a recurrent parent the Moroccan variety ‘Nachit’ derived from Triticum dicoccoides and known for its large grain size. This was recombined to three top-performing lines derived from T. dicoccoides, T. araraticum, and Aegilops speltoides, for a total of 426 inbred progenies. This NAM was evaluated across eight environments (Syria, Lebanon, and Morocco) experiencing different degrees of terminal moisture stress over two crop seasons. Our results showed that drought stress caused on average 41% loss in yield and that 1,000-kernel weight (TKW) was the most important trait for adaptation to it. Genotyping with the 25K TraitGenetics array resulted in a consensus map of 1,678 polymorphic SNPs, spanning 1,723 cM aligned to the reference ‘Svevo’ genome assembly. Kinship distinguished the progenies in three clades matching the parent of origin. A total of 18 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified as controlling various traits but independent from flowering time.

 The Sustainable Intensification of Mixed Farming Systems Initiative  aims to provide 
equitable, transformative pathways for improved livelihoods of actors in mixed 
farming systems through sustainable intensification  within target agroecologies  and 
socio -economic settings.  
 
Through action research and development partnerships,  the Initiative  will improve 
smallholder farmers'  resilience to weather -induced shocks, provide a more stable 
income and significant benefits in welfare, and enhance social justice and inclusion 
for 13 million people by 2030.  
 
Activities will be implemented in six focus countries globally representing diverse 
mixed farming systems as follows: Ghana (cereal –root crop mixed), Ethiopia 
(highland mixed), Malawi: (maize mixed), Bangladesh (rice mixed), Nepal (highland 
mixed), and Lao People's Democratic Republic (upland intensive mixed/  highland 
extensive mixed).

 v Objectives  
 
➢ To introduce and demonstrate improved fodder varieties in the working areas 
so that farmers can select the best fodder varieties for them.  
➢ To improve livestock production by improving the livestock breed, feed 
management, and capacity development of farmers.

 1 Background  
After crop production, livestock is one of the most important income generation 
sources for the village people, and 84% of village households in Bangladesh are 
involve d with livestock production (animals or poultry or both). In Bangladesh, the 
livestock sector contributes about 2% of the national GDP. Despite the huge number 
of people involved with livestock production, the country suffers from an acute 
shortage of lives tock products such as milk, meat, and eggs. In Bangladesh, the 
present milk, meat, and e ggs production can meet only 50%, 87%, and 63% of the 
national demand.  
Livestock is one of the important components of MFS, and the SI -MFS initiative has 
identified some constraints on livestock production in the rural villages of 
Bangladesh these are shortage of improved fodder and feed, rearing the local breed, 
feed managem ent, poor cattle health, diseases, lack of knowledge on proper 
livestock management, and poor linkage of livestock product marketing, etc. To 
overcome some of these constraints SI -MFS initiative has been working in northern 
and southern Bangladesh on the i nnovation of Sustainable Intensification of 
livestock production.  
 
Page 7:
 2 Rationale  
Most household/livestock farmers are unaware of high -yielding fodder varieties and 
production technology. In addition, they don’t have knowledge of fodder 
management, processing, artificial insemination (AI), scheduled vaccination, etc. 
Farmers usually don ’t cultivate any fodder, and dry rice straw is the main feed source 
of livestock throughout the year. Livestock management in southern Bangladesh is 
even more challenging due to a shortage of grazing land and an acute feed crisis in 
the dry season.  
With the partnering of the Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI) and the 
Department of Livestock Services (DLS), the SI -MFS has been doing the following 
activities:   
➢ To introduce and demonstrate improved fodder varieties in the working areas.  
➢ To provide training on fodder production and feed management  
➢ Link BLRI, BRAC, DLS, and other private companies with livestock farmers for 
cattle breed improvement through AI.  
➢ Develop chopper machine entrepreneurship.  
➢ To link milk processing companies (PRAN, Arong, MILK vita, etc.) with farmers 
for milk selling at a good price.  
 
Achievement in the Rangpur regions in 2023  
➢ Established 16 demonstrations on improved fodders varieties (Packchong, 
Red Packchong, BLRI Hybrid Napier -3, and BLRI Napier -4) 
➢ Distributed >95 thousand improved fodders cutting among the 600 farm 
households.  
➢ For feed management, 7 Mini chopper machines were distributed to 7 female 
local Service providers (LSP). Fodder chopper LSPs are always providing 
fodder and rice straw chopping services to the villagers with minimum pay.  
➢ With the help of the Department of Livestock Services, conducted vaccination 
camps.  
➢ Provided two batches of hands -on training on livestock production and feed 
management (fodder cultivation, cereal feedstuffs, TMR, silage) to 60 farmers.

Integrated Agriculture-Aquaculture (IAA) systems are diversified farming systems where aquatic and terrestrial foods are grown together on the same plot using the resources from one to benefit the other. In Egypt, for example, the production of fish such as Nile tilapia, mullet, and African catfish creates nutrient-rich water that can then be used to irrigate crops such as date palm, olives, figs, pomegranates, guava, onions, sugar beets, and tomato. IAA includes a range of technologies and methods that can be put together and adapted to each farming situation as needed. IAA is one of the most promising and fastest-growing food production systems in Egypt since it enhances production diversity, land productivity, water efficiency and nutrient cycling on farms.

creating innovative solutions to implement these systems. During the next 10 years, IAA will become an
important approach for sustainable development. Recommended innovations include the following:
• Help stakeholders use information communication technology (ICT), smart sensing and the internet of
things (IOT) for optimal use of resources.
• Adopt hybrid water management in the fish farm component of IAA by using both the flow-through
system, partial recirculating aquaculture system (PRAS) and the recirculating aquaculture system (RAS)
based on the requirements for crop irrigation.
• Support product network marketing and establish IAA pilot farms as demonstration farms for private
farmers so that they can learn how to manage IAA systems.
• Help farmers learn how to adopt new techniques through applied research, training, interactions and
shared knowledge.

Diverse Cropping Patterns
Comparing diversified cropping 
patterns in Dinajpur, Bangladesh
ABOUT  THIS  BRIEF
This  research  brief  summarizes results  from a cropping  systems diversification  
experiment  after  the first complete  cropping  cycle . The trial has been  established by 
the Bangladesh Wheat  and Maize  Research  Institute  (BWMRI)  in collaboration  with  the 
Transforming  Agrifood  Systems  in South  Asia  (TAFSSA) Initiative  in Dinajpur,  
Bangladesh in August  2022.  
PRELIMINARY  FINDINGS
1.After the first full cropping cycle (three seasons within one year) we observed 
that all diversified cropping systems outperform the most common farmer 
practice in terms of rice equivalent yields (REY), sometimes up to up to 30% more.
2.Nutritional yields of vitamin A and vitamin C can be increased by adding leafy 
vegetables during the winter rabi  season as a replacement of fallows between 
two rice crops or as maize intercrops.
3.An added leafy vegetable crop between two rice crops is among the best 
performing cropping patterns from a monetary and a nutritional point of view. However, given the high amount of irrigation water needed for boro  (winter rice), 
the environmental impact of this cropping pattern remains questionable.
BACKGROUND
The average  cropping  intensity  in Bangladesh stands  at 200%, with  five out of the 316 
identified  cropping  patterns  primarily  centered  on rice,  constituting  51% of net copped 
area (Nasim  et al., 2018 ). While  this approach  may  contribute  to food  security,  
particularly with  regards  to the nation's  primary staple  crop,  it falls  short  in addressing  
the issue  of malnutrition . Progress  toward  achieving  global nutrition  targets  remains  
limited  (Global  Nutrition  Report,  2021 ). Moreover,  environmental  challenges,  such  as 
climate  change,  excessive  groundwater  depletion,  biodiversity  loss,  and environmental  
quality  concerns,  necessitates  a focused  commitment  to ensuring  agricultural  
sustainability . To address  these  complex  issues,  this research  trial seeks  to evaluate  
diversified  cropping  patterns,  considering  their  potential  for increased  production,  
nutritional  yields,  profitability,  and environmental  impact variables .Research Note 19 November 2023

source  of nutrient  contents  values  is the Food  Composition  Table  for Bangladesh,  published  in 
2013 . (2) Production  cost  includes  all measured  costs  for seed,  fertilizer,  irrigation,  pesticides  / 
insecticides  / herbicides  used  and labor for all operations . Not included  is land  rent,  which  
however  for farmers  can be substantial,  but is nonetheless  uniform  across  treatments .
2OBJECTIVES 
This  research  aims  to discern  strategies  
that can augment  farmers'  profits  and 
nutritional  yields,  while  concurrently  
preserving  resources  and safeguarding  
or enhancing  ecological  services . The 
diverse  crop  patterns  chosen for study  
were  identified  therough  participatory  
research  with  stakeholders  in the study  
area prioritizing  production  needs . 
Additionally,  this research  seeks  to 
address  the mitigation  of greenhouse  
gas emissions originating  from  farms  
and agricultural  landscapes . Preliminary  
results  from  the first year  of crop  
rotations  are described  in this research  
brief .
DATA AND METHODS
The trial follows  a randomized  complete  
block  design,  with  nine  treatments  
(Table  1) replicated three  times . Plot  sizes  
are 17 m x 11.5 m. Treatments  4 and 5 
include  split  plots  for different  leafy  
vegetables  (spinach,  red amaranth (lal 
shak ), coriander  and napa shak) . 
Agronomic  data,  all above  ground  
biomass  crop  production,  costs  of all 
inputs  including  labor  and the amount  
of irrigation  water  applied are among  
the data  collected  (for more  information  
see Cheesman et al., 2022) .To allow  yield  comparison  between  
different  crops,  rice equivalent  yield  
(REY)  was used  (eq. 1).Nutritional yield  
(NY),  as a measure  of nutritional  value  of 
the production,  is calculated  for 
nutrients  (protein,  fat, carbohydrates),  
iron  and zinc,  as well  as Vitamin  A and 
(Eq. 2). Profitability  is assessed  by 
calculating  net income  for each crop  
(Eq. 3). Data  have  been  computed for 
each of the three  main  cropping  seasons  
in Bangladesh (Kharif -2, Rabi , Kharif -1) 
and combined  to represent  the entire  
crop  rotation .

Aman  refers to rice grown in the monsoon Kharif -2 season; while boro  refers to rice grown in the winter Rabi  season.
* In the first Kharif -2 season, established in August 2022, each replicate was split lengthwise into two strips (8.5 m x 110 
m) and two biofortified rice varieties (BINA dhan  20 and BRRI dhan  72) were grown; BINA dhan  20 yield is reported in 
blue  while BRRI dhan  72 yield shown in red. Similarly, in the “total” column the two colors indicate the sum across the 
seasons considering the yields of BINA dhan  20 (blue )and BRRI dhan  72 (red), respectively .
** T9 was summer monsoon transplanted aman  rice in this first season and not Soybean.

PELIMINARY  RESULTS
Comparing  the traditional  rice-fallow -
rice cropping  pattern  (T1) to a slightly  
diversified  rice-leafy  vegetables -rice (T4) 
rotation,  we observe  an increase  in 
nutritional  yield,  especially  for vitamins  
and iron  (Figure  1). However,  REY  
increases  were  variable  (Table  1. 
Profitability  was is heavily  dependent on 
which leafy  vegetables  are grown   
(Figure  2), and are based on an assumed  
readily  available  market  for these  
otherwise  rapidly  perishable  products . 
Importantly,  labor  requirements  were  
only  slightly  increased  when adding  a 
leafy  vegetable  between  the two rice 
seasons  (Figure  2).
The second  most  common  cropping  
pattern  in the study  area,   rice -maize -
fallow  (T2), can be intensified  by adding  
a leafy  vegetable  intercrop  during  the 
maize  growing  phase  as well  as 
replacing  the fallow  period  with  a fodder  
crop,  in this case  sorghum  (T5). This  
improved  nutritional  yield,  largely  a 
consequence  of the additional  vegetable  
crop  (Figure  1). However,  maize  yields  
appear  to be negatively  affected  by the 
intercrop  (Table  1) and labor  needs  are 
strongly  increased  in T5 compared  to T2 
(Figure  2). Additional  calculations  are however  needed  to examine  maize  
yields  using  land  equivalency  ratios,  
which will be reported  on in the next  
research  note . Profitability  is heavily  
dependent on which  leafy  vegetable  is 
grown ; a maize  napa shak intercrop  
results  in higher  net income  compared  
to sole  maize  but the other  three  leafy  
vegetables  tested  as maize  intercrops  
initially  decrease net income  (Figure  2). 
During  Kharif -1, growing  sweetcorn  (T3) 
or groundnut  (T6) instead  of maize  (T7 or 
T9) increases  REY  (Table  1). This  is  
because  of higher  prices  for sweetcorn  
and groundnut . However,  further  
research  and market  development  will 
be needed  if these  crops  are to be widely  
grown  in the region . Similarly,  T7 (Aman -
Carrot -Maize) appears  to be more  
profitable  than  the common  farmers’  
practice  rotations  (T1 and T2). T7 did not 
require  more  labour  (Figure  2), though  
farmers’  feedback  in focus  groups  
highlighted  the need  to address  
marketing  challenges  for carrot . Lastly,  
net income  was calculated  using  local  
market  prices ; however  in reality  prices  
of vegetable  crops  may  be variable  even  
within  cropping  seasons . This  variability  
will be factored -in in future  calculations  
to obtain  more  accurate  profitability  
assessments.

•For treatment description refer to Table 1.
•Kharif -2 values are based on BINA dhan  20 yield (an 
average across the entire trial area was used as in the first

no plot distinctions were made until after this first season 
(also see note at the bottom of Table 1).What  is nutritional yield : The nutritional  yield  of a specific  nutrient  refers  to the 
number  of adults  equivalents  who  can fulfil 100% of their  recommended  dietary  
refence intake  of that  nutrient  for an entire year  from the produce  of one 
hectare land  (DeFries  et al., 2015 ).

RECOMMENDATION
The findings  presented  in this research  
brief  are derived  from  one full cropping  
cycle  conducted over  the course  of a 
year . These  initial  results  indicate  
differences  in productivity,  nutritional  
yields,  and profitability  among  the 
various  cropping  patterns . Nevertheless, 
it is premature  to formulate  definitive  
conclusions  at this stage . A more  
comprehensive  dataset spanning  
multiple  years  is requisite  for a more  
comprehensive  analysis  and results . 
Furthermore,  the assessment  of the 
environmental  footprint  associated  with  
each cropping  pattern  is yet to be 
finalized  and must  be factored in before  
making  recommendations  regarding  
the optimal  cropping  patterns .

CGIAR IPSR Innovation Profile | Sustainable rangeland management toolkit for resilient pastoral systems
Sustainable rangeland management toolkit for 
resilient pastoral systems
Sustainable rangeland management toolkit with a holistic and multidisciplinary approach 
for addressing the biophysical and sociocultural aspects under changing climate and land 
use leading towards more resilient pastoral systems.
The sustainable rangeland management (SRM) toolkit advocates for a holistic and participatory multi-stakeholder 
approach that emphasizes the important role played by governance of rangelands using bottom-up landscape 
restoration. It emphasizes the need to ensure that decisions are based on both indigenous knowledge and modern 
science to address site-specific challenges. The goal of the toolkit is to assist and prepare practitioners working closely 
with local communities perform proper diagnostic, plan, and implement specific interventions and continuously 
monitor and evaluate rehabilitation or restoration efforts. Users have access to a collection of validated SRM practices 
aimed at achieving a neutral level of degradation (LDN) and offering a strong potential to rehabilitate and restore 
degraded rangeland ecosystems. The case studies demonstrate step by step how the toolkit is used to identify 
practical solutions that are integrated and socially accepted leading towards more resilient livestock and pastoral 
systems.

"10333","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

The framework for the LL4P is used by the target countries to establish a space for co-production and innovation development for low-emission food system in each of the LL4P locations. For example, in Kenya, an agreement has been signed with Kaimosi Agricultural Training Centre to establish the LL4P and set up a governing board. In China, Qinghan Village has been selected by the government as a 'Low carbon future village,' and the LL4P is using the already established frameworks to understand the pathways to low emission food system in Qingshan. In Vietnam and Colombia, participatory processes are being used to engage the stakeholders to identify needs and develop a vision for the LL4P before the establishment of the LL4P.

In other words, barriers to progress are typically viewed as issues of technology adoption, not as part of the innovation process itself. This study contributes to changing the paradigm by proposing a living lab approach, which considers innovation as an adaptive process where stakeholders co-produce knowledge and collaborate based on inclusivity and empowerment. Our specific concept for this approach is called a Living Lab for People (LL4P). This conceptual paper outlines a framework to guide the development of a LL4P that remains flexible to be adapted for specific sites. While we seek to identify common denominators, we recognize the necessity for such a framework to remain open enough to be adaptable for varied contexts. Consequently, the framework draws on the living lab literature but tailors existing approaches for sustainable food system transformation and puts people (men, women, and marginalized groups among key food system actors) at the center of innovation processes with a clear intention to address power and social inequity. We draw on specific cases in China, Colombia, Kenya and Vietnam as learning grounds for formulating LL4Ps through locally led innovation processes. Based on our learnings and consultations, we define a LL4P as an inclusive and diverse space for people to advance their socio-technical innovation processes and associated modes of governance within a facilitated organizational structure. The principles of LL4Ps include co-production, gender equality and social inclusion, governance and institutional sustainability to advance existing and novel innovation processes. The practical experiences from applying this framework in the four case studies indicate alternative pathways for transforming the food system toward a sustainable and socially equitable trajectory through the establishment of a LL4P.

With this in mind, IFPRI and the Hayel Saeed Anam (HSA) Group organized a joint workshop examining existing public, private, and third sector collaboration, exploring opportunities for stronger partnerships to build resilient food systems, and resulting in concrete plans for a joint initiative. Partnership between HSA, Tetra Pak, the Ministry of Education, and the World Food Programme improved service delivery by introducing daily milk provisions alongside fortified biscuits to schoolchildren in Southern Yemen. In turn, IFPRI is undertaking an HSA-FCM co-funded impact evaluation on schoolchildren’s diet, health, nutrition and education outcomes amid humanitarian crisis. This public-private sector partnership provides ground-breaking, evidence-based action to improve the lives of schoolchildren while simultaneously generating evidence for improved policy and programs.

• Yemen is experiencing one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises resulting from prolonged conflict, with about half the population suffering from food insecurity.
• Food availability and affordability in Yemen is extremely vulnerable to external shocks because of the fragility of the national food system and its heavy dependence on food imports by the private sector and international humanitarian agencies.
• A recent workshop jointly organized by IFPRI and HSA Group reviewed the state of collaboration between key actors in Yemen’s food system and discussed avenues to building strong cross-sector partnerships for ending the current food crisis and strengthening food system resilience.
• Limited collaboration among the public, private, and third sectors (for example, in the form of collective action, multistakeholder partnerships) contributes to inefficiencies in food supply chains and food aid delivery.
• Currently, collaborations are often ad hoc, limited to peer-to-peer partnerships, and constrained by a siloed mentality.
• With a potential peace agreement, new opportunities for cross sector collaboration and strategic partnerships between food system actors are emerging.
• Enhanced communication among the public, private, and third sectors is an important first step toward improving mutual understanding, building trust, exchanging critical information and ideas, and realizing opportunities for effective collective action.

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","They think we are delaying their outputs' - The challenges of interdisciplinary research: understanding power dynamics between social and biophysical scientists in international crop breeding teams Public sector crop improvement for development programmes aims to produce varieties tailored to the needs of smallholder farmers and their environments. Understanding how social heterogeneity, including gender, drives trait preferences is essential to ensure that crop improvement objectives meet farmers’ and stakeholder demands. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating social science knowledge with crop breeding. Although the necessity of interdisciplinary research is recognised and promoted, it is impeded by a multitude of challenges including ontological and epistemological differences, institutional and global hierarchies, disciplinary power relations and struggles for scientific authority. The Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D) sector is marked by entrenched power differentials, including dominance of the biophysical sciences, a historical emphasis on technical solutions which ignores social contexts, and the underrepresentation of women scientists and farmers themselves. Nevertheless, there is limited theoretically informed analysis of power dynamics within AR4D settings. Drawing on qualitative, ethnographic observations of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement (ILCI), this article seeks to understand how power affects interdisciplinary research processes. Critical ethnography and power theory is used to analyse power within international crop breeding collaborations and the implications for inclusive knowledge production and research impact. The Powercube is used to examine how visible, hidden and invisible forms of power manifest within local, national, and international relationships across closed, invited and claimed spaces. Our findings suggest that these intersecting power dimensions, which include disciplinary, gendered, institutional and global hierarchies, constrain the contributions that individual researchers can make – particularly social scientists – thereby hindering disciplinary integration. The ILCI case study reveals the complex multi-dimensional dynamics that emerge within agricultural research teams and highlights structural limitations constraining efforts to build socially inclusive and gender-responsive crop improvement programmes. The article contributes to a small but growing literature studying the social construction of agricultural science, and provides insights that can enable interdisciplinary research strategies to more effectively meet the needs of farmers and other stakeholders.

user research process that fed the first two phases of the design cycle —scope and explore —and the input received 
from farmers and technicians in the department of El Paraíso and institutions such as InfoAgro and the Dirección de 
Ciencia y Tecnología Agropecuaria  (DICTA) of the Honduran  Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería  (SAG). So far, the 
information generated has made it possible to create a  user typology , or persona , for farmers. The next steps will be 
the generation of personas  for technicians and decision -makers, as well as the first prototypes of agroclimatic 
bulletins (for farmers and technicians) and reports (for decision -makers). These will be refined through a pilot 
exercise to be implemented in the first half of 2024.

Honduras  3 
 Introducción  
Adopción e inclusión. ¿ Cómo alcanzarlas cuando se trata de herramientas y soluciones para los actores del sistema 
agroalimentario centroamericano? El enfoque —o metodología como también se conoce — de Diseño Centrado en 
el Humano (DCH) ha demostrado ser eficaz no solo en áreas rel acionadas con la generación y consumo de 
productos digitales, sino también para generar soluciones que mejoran las condiciones de vida de las personas 
más vulnerables de la sociedad. IDEO.org , por ejemplo, ha sido demostrado tener impacto positivo mediante la 
aplicación del enfoque DCH para producir soluciones que impactan la vida de personas en diferentes lugares del 
planeta.  
En ese sentido, La Alianza Bioversity -CIAT ha decidido adoptar el enfoque de DCH para garantizar que el desarrollo 
de nuevas herramientas —y la revisión y ajuste de las existentes — sea guiado por principios más cercanos a las 
necesidades y condiciones habi litantes de las personas para las que se hace investigación. De ahí que se haya 
defini do este enfoque como un proceso de cinco fases, que se basan en la i) identificación de un problema o desafío 
de diseño ( scope  o alcance), ii) la colección de información  de los usuarios ( explore  o exploración), iii) el diseño de 
prototipos ( create  o creación), iv) la evaluación de los prototipos en pilotos con usuarios y grupos de interés ( validate  
o validación) y, finalmente, v) la reanudación el ciclo de diseño a partir de una evaluación constante que tienen lugar 
durante la fase de escalamiento de la herramienta ( scale  o escalamiento) ( Figura 1). Como se puede observar, en 
cada una de las fases hay momentos divergencia (generación de ideas de manera profusa) y convergencia 
(concreción de esas ideas en temas y oportunidades de diseño) ( Figura 1). Esta dinámica es propia del ciclo de 
diseño, el cual es iterativo y siempre susceptible a mejorar.

Los resultados obtenidos hasta el momento son alentadores, en parte, por la unidad de visión que comparten 
nuestros socios con la Alianza , pues se reconoc e que el DCH ha permitido  —y permitirá a futuro — identificar con 
mayor claridad las necesidades de los usuarios.  
A continuación, se presenta el reporte  compuesto por tres secciones que describen cada una de las fases del ciclo 
de diseño  abarcadas a  la fecha (i.e., alcance  y exploración) ( Figura 1), y otra sección dedicada a las  reflexiones  
finales .

 Fases de alcance y exploración  
Fase 1: Alcance  
A partir de las consultas  sostenidas en mayo de 2023 con el equipo de la Alianza en Honduras y 
algunos de sus socios como InfoAgro , de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería (SAG) , y el Centro 
de Estudios Atmosféricos, Oceanográficos y S ísmicos (CENAOS)  de la Secretaría de Gestión de 
Riesgo y Contingencias Nacionales  s se identificó el desafío de diseño —o problemática a afrontar —
: Producir boletines y reportes agroclimáticos mejor adaptados a las necesidades de  
diferentes tipos de usuarios, e.g.,  agricultores/as, técnicos/as y tomadores de decisiones  de 
los socios de la  Alianza .  
 
Como parte de las actividades de la fase “Alcance”, en mayo también se realizó el taller denominado 
«Diseño centrado en el humano y perspectiva de género» cuyo objetivo fue sensibilizar a los profesionales de la 
Alianza que participan en proyectos de AgriLAC en Honduras , con el enfoque y su relación con la perspectiva de 
Género e Inclusión Social  (GIS) ; dos abordajes estrechamente relacionados. Los objetivos de esta actividad eran i) 
ayudar a entender el marco conceptual del enfoque de DCH —y relación intrínseca con GIS — para visualizar su 
potencial en el aumento de la adopción e inclusión de las herram ientas desarrolladas y, con base en esto, ii) alentar 
la aplicación del enfoque en los diferentes proyectos que se están desarrollando en el marco de AgriLAC.  En el 
taller s e presentaron elementos conceptuales sobre DCH y GIS , y se realizaron ejercicios sobre cómo identificar un 
desafío de diseño, transformar desafíos en oportunidades  y analizar el uso de herramientas a partir de un mapa de 
experiencia.

Se contó con la participación  de 11 personas provenientes de Honduras, México y Colombia , y co n distintas 
formaciones académicas: agronomía, antropología, biología y estadística  (Figura 2). En las reflexiones  finales  del 
taller se mencionó que,  para desarrollar herramientas con  mayor adopción e inclusión , es necesario entender que 
la perspectiva de GIS va más allá de un número  específico de  mujeres y hombre s participando en talleres; más bien, 
se trata de la posibilidad de ser  lo suficientemente  incluyentes para entender mejor las diferentes perspectivas que 
tienen mujeres y hombres sobre la activid ad agropecuaria y las dinámicas del clima de los lugares donde viven y 
desarrollan sus actividades económicas . También se resaltó que , dada la experiencia  que se está generando en la

 Alianza alrede dor del enfoque de DCH , la institución  se encuentra en una posición única para orientar a donantes, 
otros centros de investigación  y socios  sobre las posibilidades que abre el DCH para aumentar l a adopción de los 
servicios climáticos existentes y lo s que se producirán en el futuro . 
El taller dio un impulso importante a los profesionales de la Alianza  en Honduras  para que adoptaran el enfoque  
DCH y lo implementaran en dos acciones específic as; i) la generación de un boletín agroclimático para agricultores 
y ii) un reporte agroclimático para técnicos y tomadores/as de decisiones de I NFOAGRO  y CENAOS. Esto se logró 
hacer de manera sistemática  gracias al desarrollo de un documento denominado plan de investigación de 
usuario ; hoja de ruta para hacer frente al desafío de diseño . En él se consignaron objetivos  y fases de investigación  
(Tabla 1).

Los objetivos de la investigación de usuario  fueron: i) conocer las percepciones de agricultores/as, técnicos/as y 
tomadores /as de decisiones frente a los boletines climáticos y agroclimáticos producidos por CENAOS, I NFOAGRO  
y las Mesas Técnicas Agroclimáticas (MTA); ii) generar tipologías de usuarios que acceden a la información 
agroclimática (creación de personas ); y iii) definir los canales de difusión de información agroclimática más 
adecuada según tipología de usuario.  A la fecha , se ha avanzado  en los dos primeros objetivo s. 
Fase 2: Explorar  
Para entender mejor a las personas con las que se co -diseña, es necesario conocer su contexto , y 
entrevistarlos para entender  sus necesidades, objetivos, capacidades, etc . Se realizaron 15 
entrevistas ; cinco a agricultores; cinco a técnicos y cinco a tomadores  de decisiones  (Figura 3). En 
el Anexo  1 se pueden consultar el instrumento (entrevista) aplicado . Adicionalmente, l a Figura 4 
describe  las actividades desarrolladas en fase “Explorar” ; i) actividades  exploración  para definir el 
desafío de diseño , ii) investigación de usuario (trabajo de campo), iii) sistematización de entrevistas , 
y iv) creación de personas. Todos ellas, insumos necesario s para crear las tipologías de usuario, o 
personas , en el departamento de El Paraíso. De momento,  la primera persona  generada es un 
agricultor del valle de Jamastrán  (Figura 5) al que  le dimos el nombre “Augusto” .  
 
Con el concepto personas  se hace referencia a un perfil de usuario idealizado que representa los deseos y 
necesidades de un subgrupo de una población objetivo . En ese sentido, l as personas  son el resultado de un análisis 
en profundidad de los actuales o futuros usuarios potenciales de su servicio  o herramienta, en este caso, de un 
boletín agroclimático . Además, r epresentan  objetivos, actitudes y patrones de comportamiento más que 
identificadores demográficos como la edad  o el género —que pueden formar parte de  la persona , pero no  son 
considerados como factores diferenciadores para crearl as—.

 Reflexiones finales  
El enfoque de DCH es una apuesta interesante para llevar a cabo investigación interdisciplinaria entre modeladores 
de clima, agrónomos, científicos sociales (e.  g., geógrafos, antropólogos, etc.), diseñadores industriales, ingenieros 
de sistemas y, por supuesto, agricultoras, agricultores, técnicas , técnicos  y socios . La experiencia generada hasta el 
momento indica que existe un gran interés en mejorar la forma en que se genera, comparte e interpreta la 
información agroclimática.  En este sentido, v ale la pena resaltar la importancia de avanzar paralelamente  en dos 
dimensiones; i) el diseño de herramientas intuitivas y de amplia d ifusión —camino en el que se está  avanzando de 
manera rápida — y ii) la generación de información agroclimática localizada y cada vez más precisa —entendiendo 
las dificultades que implica la generación de pronósticos climáticos —.  
Tras esta primera experiencia, que se basa principalmente en el desarrollo de las dos primeras fases del enfoque 
DCH (i.e., alcance  y exploración) (Figura 1), durante el 2024 se espera  continuar con la generación de personas  para 
técnicos/cas y tomadores/as de decisiones  y, posteriormente , con la preparación de prototipos  de boletines  y 
reportes agroclimáticos . Cuando se definan las versiones finales de los boletines y reportes, se harán pilotajes  para  
evaluar el nivel de adopción en los grupos poblacionales  que lo s implementen. En 2024 también se espera reportar 
los hallazgos de este proceso .

ABSTRACT  
Page 5:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  4 
 Peru is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its unique geographical location and 
socioeconomic conditions (Oliver -Smith, 2014) . The country is particularly susceptible to climate change effects, 
such as increased frequency of extreme weather events, enhanced glacier retreat, loss of biodiversity, increased soil 
erosion risk, among others (Correa et al., 2016; Heikkinen, 2017; Zevallos and Lavado -Casimiro, 2022) . Smallholder 
farmers face significant challenges adapting to these changes, as their livelihoods are closely tied to natural 
resources (Heikkinen, 2017; Lennox, 2015) . Moreover, socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, food insecurity, poor 
health, and marginalization, exacerbate these vulnerabilities and make it difficult for communities to adapt 
(Heikkinen, 2021; Oliver -Smith, 2014) . 
In Peru, climate change has intensified hydrometeorological hazards, such as torrential rainfalls, floods, and glacier 
retreat, leading to migration within the country (Bergmann et al., 2021) . The country's geographic, economic, 
developmental, social, demographic, and environmental characteristics vary between its regions, making them 
vulnerable to different levels of climate change impacts (Hoffman and Grigera, 2013) . 
The climate hazards are exacerbated in the Peruvian Andes and Amazon because of the high levels of poverty and 
inequality, with major deficiencies in basic services and threats related to environmental degradation, climate 
change, and pressure on water sou rces in the coastal and Andean areas, resulting in social tension and violence 
centered on the environmental impacts of extractive industries and large infrastructure projects. Also, melting 
glaciers are shrinking dry -season water supplies, disrupting rura l highland society, and sparking migration (Hoffman 
and Grigera, 2013) . 
Climate hazards among other factors have push migration from the Andes highlands to the Amazon, together with 
aspiration of access new land (Ichikawa et al., 2014) . Immigrants from the Andes often move to the Amazon for better 
opportunities and resource access, contributing to deforestation and environmental degradation in the region 
(Menton and Cronkleton, 2019) . 
In turn, deforestation affects the carbon stock by releasing carbon stored in trees and soils, contributing to 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (Achard et al., 2014) . Loss of forest cover also reduces the capacity 
of forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. According to the IPCC Special 
Report on Climate Change and Land 2019 (IPCC, 2019a) , the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sector is the 
second largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, second only to burning fossil fuels. During 2007 -
2016, land use and land -use change are estimated to have generated net CO2 emissio ns of 5.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr -1 
(IPCC, 2019b) . Deforestation was the main cause of net CO2 emissions, as well as soil cultivation and oxidation of 
wood products, among others. In the western Amazon, specifically in the Madre de Dios region, forest loss was at 
an annual rate of -0.21% between 1999 and  2018 (Alarcón et al., 2021) . In addition, Asner et al. (2010)  reported that 
over 4.3 million ha of the Peruvian Amazon between 1999 and 2009, emissions from land use totaled 1.1% of the 
standing carbon and forest degradation increased regional carbon emissions by 47% over deforestation alone, 
while secondary regrowt h provided an 18% offset against total gross emissions.  
Peru is among the nations that have ratified the Paris Agreement. Through its Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), Peru has committed to reducing its annual GHG emissions by 30% in 2030 compared to a business -as-usual 
scenario. An established target  in these NDCs is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the 
forestry sector and land -use changes (LUCs) by 43.1 MtCO2eq by 2030, which represents more than the 50% of the 
total reduction committed by that year (MINAM, 2019) . In contrast, deforestation rates increased by 58% in 2009 -
2016 compared to 2001 -2008 (MINAM, 2016; Vázquez -Rowe et al., 2019) . In this sense, identifying and addressing 
the direct and underlying drivers of deforestation and land use change is essential for effective national strategies. 
This study aims to analyze these main drivers, particularly focusing on the interconnected re gions of the Andes and 
the Amazon.  
Some studies have been done to predict deforestation across the Peruvian Amazon, such as applying machine 
learning algorithms or other related tools. Using such methods could help improve strategies for reducing future 1 INTRODUCTION

 deforestation and preserving carbon stocks in Peru and other forest regions (Rojas et al., 2021) . Additionally, high 
spatial resolution monitoring of aboveground carbon density (ACD) and emissions (ACE) in Peru revealed a total of 
7.138 Pg C estimated for the country, with an annual ACE of 20.08 Tg C between the third quarters of 2017 and 
2018 (Csillik and Asner, 2020a) . This finding underscores the need for enhanced forest carbon management at scale 
to mitigate climate change.  
Understanding the impact of land management practices on soil carbon dynamics in Peruvian ecosystems is 
essential for implementing effective conservation and restoration policies. Oliver et al. (2017)  found that grazing and 
burning increased soil CO2 fluxes and decomposition rates in Peruvian montane grasslands. Still, long -term carbon 
storage in occluded light fractions and heavy fractions was not negatively impacted. This is useful for designing 
appropriate land -use management strategies that do not compromise the carbon storage capacity of these 
ecosystems.  
This document focuses on the Andes and Amazon conditions where climate hazards affect a large number of 
smallholders and produce the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. The insights gained from 
this study are crucial for informing po licy decisions and conservation efforts, not only in Peru but also in other regions 
facing similar challenges.  
2.1 NATURAL CAPITAL AND CLIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DEFORESTATION IN THE 
AMAZON AND ANDES  
The Amazon rainforest, a vital ecosystem for global carbon regulation and a significant reservoir of natural capital, 
is critical in mitigating climate change and preserving biodiversity (Azevedo et al., 2020; Gatti et al., 2021) . The 
interplay between the Andean and Amazonian ecosystems is crucial for regional climate regulation, underscoring 
the need for integrated conservation strategies that consider the dynamics of both regions. Coe et al. (2017)  noted 
that tropical forests play a direct role in maintaining low surface temperatures and high precipitation. Indigenous 
and local communities play a vital role in preserving the natural capital of these regions. Recognizing and integrating 
their traditi onal knowledge and practices is essential for effective and sustainable management of these ecosystems.  
On the other hand, forest degradation from selective logging and understory fires contributes to carbon emissions, 
potentially accounting for up to 40% of carbon loss in the region (Berenguer et al., 2014) . In this sense, some authors 
point out that addressing deforestation and degradation requires implementing policies that consider aspects such 
as reducing forest fires and increasing the area of secondary forests while avoiding further removal of primary forests 
(Arag ão et al., 2014; Azevedo et al., 2020) . Incentives for better forest management and integrating local, regional, 
national, and international policies are also noted as necessary to adapt to and mitigate climate change (Azevedo 
et al., 2020) . For instance, a study by Barua et al. (2012)  found that carbon payments could effectively reduce forest 
clearing and pointed out that an effective policy to combat tropical deforestation should jointly consider the forestry 
and cash -crop sectors. Some authors point out that policies and programs lik e Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) should support existing efforts towards forest sustainability and 
balance economic development with the protection of natural capital to ensure the long -term viability of these 
critical  ecosystems (Bottazzi et al., 2014; Galford et al., 2011) .  
In 2016, Aguiar et al. noted a decrease in deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, stabilizing around 6,000 km2 
yr−1 in the previous five years of their study. They stated that while a combination of factors contributed to the 
decreased deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, including creating protected areas, effective monitoring 
systems, and credit restriction m echanisms, several threats remained, such as rapidly expanding global markets for 
agricultural commodities, large -scale transportation and energy infrastructure projects, and weak institutions 
(Aguiar et al., 2016) . In contrast, Murugasan et al. (2019) , modeling deforestation scenarios, concluded that the 2 CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND VULNERABILITY IN 
THE ANDES AND AMAZON

 Amazon Basin is at risk of significant deforestation, with the forested area predicted to be reduced by about half by 
2050 under the Business -as-Usual scenario and if the current rate of deforestation continues, the world´s forests 
could dissolve within th e next 100 years.  
On the other hand, the high Andes region is home to diverse ecosystems crucial in carbon sequestration and climate 
regulation, such as paramo grasslands, montane cloud forests, and high -altitude wetlands (Peña et al., 2011) . Andean 
forests act as strong sinks for aboveground carbon and have a high potential to serve as future carbon refuges 
(Duque et al., 2021) . As climate change continues to impact these regions, adaptive management strategies that 
can respond to evolving environmental conditions are crucial for the sustainability of these ecosystems and the 
communities that depend on them. For instance, montan e cloud forests in the high Andes, such as those in Manu 
National Park, Peru, are also significant carbon stores. Improved management of these ecosystems can generate 
additional income for rural communities by commercializing carbon credits (Gibbon et al., 2010) . Also, Andean 
peatlands are essential for carbon and nitrogen accumulation. Understanding the factors affecting the accumulation 
of these elements in peatlands is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change on these ecosystems (León and 
Oliván, 2014) . In addition, the Andean plateau contains significant soil organic carbon (SOC) reservoirs, which are 
vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic activities, such as changes in land use and water management 
(Muñoz et al., 2015) . 
The region faces numerous challenges, including land use change, deforestation, and climate change, which affect 
carbon storage and the livelihoods of local communities (Barrera et al., 2012) . Although several projects have been 
implemented to promote environmentally friendly farming practices and soil and water conservation techniques, 
economic development in the Andean region is often hampered by extreme poverty, low agricultural productivit y, 
and limited off -farm opportunities. Exploring sustainable economic opportunities, such as ecotourism and 
sustainable harvesting of non -timber forest products, could provide alternative income sources for local 
communities while contributing to conservat ion efforts.  
Deforestation and land -use change have been significant sources of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in South 
America, with pasture expansion, commercial cropland, and infrastructure development often noted as some of the 
main drivers (De Sy et al., 2015) . While there are policies in place aimed at protecting these ecosystems, challenges 
in implementation and enforcement remain significant. Strengthening governance and institutional capacities is 
crucial for the effective management of these regions. In th e Andean community countries, there is a bidirectional 
relationship between economic growth, consumption of energy, and CO 2 emissions (Koengkan et al., 2018) . To 
ensure the sustainable development and protection of these ecosystems, it is essential to implement effective land 
use policies, promote environmentally friendly practices, and address the economic and social challenges local 
communities face.  
2.1.1  Amazon ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The Amazon is a critical carbon sink in the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation. Its ecosystems, 
including the rainforest, peatlands, mangroves, and transitional forests, store substantial carbon. These ecosystems 
are essential for optimizing  conservation efforts and maintaining global climate stability.  
The Amazon rainforest has been a long -term net biomass sink, although the rate of carbon accumulation has 
decreased over recent decades (Brienen et al., 2015) . Rödig et al. (2018)  found that the Amazon rainforest gains 
0.56 GtC per year, driven by a mean gross primary productivity (GPP) of 25.1 tC ha-1 a-1 and a mean woody 
aboveground net primary productivity (wANPP) of 4.2 tC ha-1 a-1. The study also found that forest structure and 
successional states are essential factors in the relationship between productivity and biomass, highlighting the need 
for forest management strategies that consider these aspects.  
Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, but human disturbances, such as selective logging, 
understory fires, and habitat fragmentation, affect carbon stocks and emissions. Disturbed forests store 40% less 
aboveground carbon on average compar ed to undisturbed forests and are structurally similar to secondary forests. 
Carbon emissions from these disturbances are significant and could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from 
deforestation in the Amazon (Berenguer et al., 2014) . 
Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests in the tropics, contributing disproportionately to the 
carbon sequestration (Alongi, 2014) . The Brazilian Amazon has one of the largest areas of mangroves in the world, 
Page 8:
December 23  | Deforestation Dynamics in Peru  7 
 storing substantial amounts of carbon. The mean ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves east of the Amazon River 
ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha-1, with the Amazon mangroves storing over twice the amount of carbon than upland 
evergreen forests and almost ten times the amount found in tropical dry forests (Kauffman et al., 2018) . However, 
potential carbon losses due to deforestation are of immediate concern, with rates greater than these ecosystems' 
carbon storage (Alongi, 2014) . 
The dry transitional forests in southern Amazonia have received less attention but represent important carbon -
cycling ecosystems (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . These forests exhibit higher leaf photosynthesis and total GPP 
due to drier soil conditions favoring dry deciduous tree species. Carbon allocation patterns are similar to those in 
wetter humid forests, with the dry forests of southern Amazonia acting as a scaled -down version of their humid 
counterparts (Araujo -Murakami et al., 2013) . 
Amazonian peatlands store significant amounts of carbon, with tropical peatlands accounting for about half of the 
global peatland emitted carbon (Ribeiro et al., 2021) . For instance, the Amazon's Pastaza -Marañón Foreland Basin 
(PMFB) is among the largest known intact tropical peatland landscapes globally and is considered highly threatened 
due to human activities such as deforestation and agricultural expansion (Roucoux et al., 2017) . Peatlands in 
Amazonian Peru cover 35,600 ± 2133 km2 and contain 3.14 (0.44 -8.15) Pg C. Peatland pole forests, in particular, are 
identified as the most carbon -dense ecosystem in Amazonia (1391 ± 710 Mg C ha-1) (Draper et al., 2014) . Swindles 
(2018)  reported that the Aucayacu peatland in the PMFB is the oldest peatland in Amazonia, accumulating peat up 
to 7.5 meters deep in approximately 8,900 years.  
These ecosystems face various threats, including deforestation, agricultural expansion, and climate change. The 
preservation of these ecosystems is not only crucial for carbon sequestration but also for maintaining biodiversity 
and supporting local communi ties. It is crucial to protect these ecosystems and support their role as carbon sinks to 
maintain global climate stability and ensure the success of the Paris Climate Agreement (Walker et al., 2020) . 
Peruvian amazon has several concrete examples of ecosystems that play a key role in mitigating climate change by 
acting as carbon sinks such as palm swamp peatlands and high -altitude grasslands. Understanding their carbon 
storage and dynamics is essential for developing effective conservation and restoration policies (Guerrero -Palomino 
et al., 2022; Hastie et al., 2022; Mu ñoz et al., 2015) . 
Amazon palm swamp peatlands are major carbon sinks and reservoirs, storing significant amounts of carbon 
alongside Andean forests with a strong carbon sink capacity (0.67 ± 0.08 Mg C ha−1 y−1)  (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque 
et al., 2021) . However, these ecosystems are threatened due to deforestation and land -use changes, with the 
Peruvian Amazon losing around 190,000 hectares of forest in 2020 alone (Dourojeanni, 2022) . The ongoing 
degradation of these ecosystems can potentially disrupt peat accretion and reduce carbon stocks, emphasizing the 
need for sustainable management and protection (Dezzeo et al., 2021; Duque et al., 2021) . 
2.1.2  Andean ecosystems with a high accumulation of carbon  
The High Andean ecosystems, such as wetlands, forests, grasslands, and the paramo, puna, and southern Andean 
steppe habitats, are characterized by unique environmental conditions and diverse flora and fauna that contribute 
to various ecosystem services, in cluding carbon accumulation and sequestration (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; 
Arroyo and Cavieres, 2013) . These ecosystems play a critical role in mitigating climate change by storing significant 
amounts of carbon in aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and organic soil (Gibbon et al., 2010; Segnini 
et al., 2011) .  
High Andean wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other habitats are known for their substantial carbon storage 
capacity due to their low decomposition rates, which result from flooded soils, low temperatures, and low soil pH 
(Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Mu ñoz et al., 2015; Oliveras et al., 2014) . Research has shown that these ecosystems store 
significant amounts of carbon in aboveground and belowground biomass, as well as in organic soil, with the latter 
accounting for the highest carbon storage (Alvis -Ccoropuna et al., 2021; Girardin et al., 2014; V ásquez et al., 2014) . In a 
study centered on the cloud forest -grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru, Gibbon et al. 
(2010)  found that the puna grasslands stored 7.5 ± 0.7 Mg C ha-1 in aboveground biomass, while the forest near the 
treeline contained 63.4 ± 5.2 Mg C ha-1 aboveground and an additional 13.9 ± 2.8 Mg C ha-1 in the coarse roots.

 The unique environmental conditions of the High Andean ecosystems, such as cold and wet climate, low 
atmospheric pressure, and low soil pH, contribute to the accumulation of organic matter and carbon storage (Muñoz 
et al., 2015, 2013) . Organic matter decomposes very slowly in these conditions, and its content increases with altitude. 
Approximately 40 -60% of the soil organic carbon (OC) exists within the top 20 -cm layer, with a high C/N ratio in the 
Andean highlands indicating intense h umification (Muñoz et al., 2015) . Segnini et al . (2011)  determined carbon 
contents and carbon stocks in five Peruvian agroecologies along a 1,000 km transect and found that soils in the 
tropical highland rainforest site had the highest carbon contents (134 g kg -1 [13.4%]) and that diversified production 
systems with crops and livestock were more stable for carbon stocks.  
Human activities, such as grazing, burning, and land use changes, can negatively impact the carbon storage capacity 
of high Andean ecosystems and their biodiversity (Muñoz et al., 2013; Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . These 
disturbances can reduce the net primary productivity (NPP) of the puna grasslands and result in the loss of grasslands 
and montane forests due to agriculture and other land use changes (Oliveras et al., 2014; Tovar et al., 2013) . 
Consequently, it is essential to implement strategies to protect these ecosystems and their essential functions, 
including their roles as stable carbon reservoirs and habitats for threatened species.  
The tropical montane forest ecosystems of the Peruvian Andes are under threat from climate change, which is 
expected to have a high potential impact on 58% of all montane forests, particularly in the elevation range between 
800 and 1200 m.a.s.l (Bax et al., 2021) . Moreover, about 64% of montane forests in protected areas will be exposed 
to high potential impact. Enhancing the adaptive capacity of these ecosystems through restorative and preventive 
conservation measures, such as improving forest functions and mitig ating deforestation and forest degradation 
pressures, is crucial for their survival (Bax et al., 2021) . 
Andean peatlands, particularly those formed by cushion plants, and high -altitude grasslands in the Andean plateau, 
such as the puna, are vital carbon sinks in Peru. These peatlands and grasslands are influenced by climate change 
and human activities, such as grazing, ditching, and unsuitable water management, which alter hydrologic 
conditions and degrade these essential carbon reservoirs (Muñoz et al., 2015; Planas -Clarke et al., 2020) . Hydrologic 
restoration, such as rewetting of moderately drained peatlands, could help moderate climate change's impacts on 
Andean peatlands and increase their ability to store carbon (Planas -Clarke et al., 2020)  
2.2 Vulnerability to climate change in Peru  
Climate change poses significant risks to Peru, making the country highly vulnerable to food insecurity, floods, 
landslides, water scarcity, vector -borne diseases, coastal risks, and systemic failures due to cascading impacts of 
hazards and epidemics, amon g others (Hagen et al., 2022) . Inequities in water governance and changes in the 
hydrology of Peru due to glacial retreat are magnifying vulnerabilities in communities, food producers, and poor 
urban neighbourhoods  (Lynch, 2012) . These challenges underscore the need for comprehensive and inclusive 
approaches to water management and climate adaptation strategies. Various adaptation measures have been 
identified to address these risks, but the low adaptive capacity and climate chan ge may limit their effectiveness 
(Hagen et al., 2022) . Furthermore, there is a need for increased investment in building adaptive capacities at local 
and national levels to enhance resilience against climate change. Additionally, adaptation strategies have limited 
attention, which is insufficient for the cou ntry (Takahashi and Meisner, 2012) . 
Climate change affects the food systems in Peru, with implications for agricultural production, food security, and the 
livelihoods of smallholder farmers (Lozano -Povis et al., 2021; Tito et al., 2018) . The Andean region is highly 
vulnerable to climate change, with increased rainfall intensity, soil erosion, retreat of glaciers, and loss of vegetation 
cover, all impacting crop dynamics. Innovative agricultural practices and technologies, such as climate -smart 
agriculture, are essential to adapt to these changing conditions.  In this regard, Peru's food production and crop 
yields are also negatively affected, especially for crops such as quinoa, potatoes, and tarwi (Lozano -Povis et al., 
2021) . 
One of the primary challenges to Peru's food systems is ensuring adequate food production and security in the face 
of climate change. Rising temperatures can lead to declining crop yields, forcing farmers to change cultivation 
practices or relocate their c rops to higher elevations. However, such changes may also result in the introduction of 
novel pests and a decline in crop quality and value, leading to severe economic losses for local farmers and food 
insecurity (Tito et al., 2018) .

 2.2.1  Climate -related hazard for the Andes and Amazon  
The climate -related hazards in Peru pose significant threats to the diverse environments, ranging from coastal 
deserts to high Andean mountains and humid Amazon lowlands (Young and Le ón, 2009) . Population growth and urban 
expansion increase the vulnerability of communities to these hazards, which include floods, landslides, glacial 
retreat, and extreme weather events (Oliver -Smith, 2014; Vil ímek et al., 2005) . 
El Niño events are one of the primary climate -related hazards in Peru, causing intense rainfall, ponding water, flash 
floods, and landslides, leading to significant damage to society (Brill et al., 2020) . Damage modelling  based on data -
mining methods and remote sensing products, are some tools used in risk assessments. The integration of these 
advanced technologies with traditional knowledge systems can enhance the accuracy and relevance of risk 
assessments. Also, the topo graphic wetness index and the slope length and steepness factor are crucial features in 
classifying damage from compound natural hazards like El Niño events (Brill et al., 2020) . 
On the other hand, glacier retreat in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range has led to the formation of glacial lakes, 
posing a risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) (Vilímek et al., 2014) . GLOFs are closely connected with dynamic 
slope movements, such as ice - and rock -falls and landslides of steep moraine slopes, accounting for around 80% of 
GLOFs in the region. These outburst floods can lead to highly hazardous debris and mudflows, signif icantly 
impacting the high mountainous environment (Vilímek et al., 2014) . Despite efforts by a Peruvian glaciology and lakes 
security office, glacier disasters killed nearly 30,000 people in five glacier -related disasters in Peru´s Cordillera 
Blanca from 1941 to 1970 (Carey, 2005) . A lack of trust between local communities and government officials has 
exacerbated the problem, where many residents live in hazard zones.  
Andean populations are vulnerable to climate change and disasters due to poverty, food insecurity, poor health, 
and marginalization. According to Oliver -Smith (2014) , to address these vulnerabilities, adaptation policies must 
integrate measures to reduce specific hazards with programs aimed at reducing systemic vulnerabilities and societal 
inequality. This approach should include empowering local communities and ensur ing their active participation in 
decision -making processes.  
Addressing climate -related hazards in Peru requires a better understanding and integration of scientific knowledge 
and local expertise (Salzmann et al., 2009) . For example, physically -based numerical models can help simulate

Report 2023 & Outlook 2024
In India, the CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive Solutions works in remote parts of 
Western India’s Maharashtra State. NATURE+ and its partners selected several sites 
(called clusters) for their high potential for implementing nature-positive activities to 
improve nutrition, climate resilience, food security and to conserve nature. People in 
these tribal areas also have rich traditional knowledge that is key to natural solutions. Nature-Positive Solutions Initiative Country Overview
Page 2:
What is NATURE+?
The CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive Solutions 
aims to re-imagine, collaboratively create and 
implement nature-positive solutions for agri-
food systems that equitably support food and 
livelihoods and ensure that agriculture is a net-
positive contributor to biodiversity and nature.
The challenges
There are several challenges to a nature-positive 
transition in India. There is limited local-level data on 
available resources and their utilization for nature-
positive land use. There is a general lack of awareness 
on the efficient use of resources. There is little to no 
market for sustainable circular economy business 
models. Financing for nature-based solutions at the 
individual or farm level remains low.
The NATURE+ approach
The Initiative works in collaboration with highly capable 
partner organizations that specialize in activities related 
to agricultural management and production. In addition, 
NATURE+ collaborates with relevant on-the-ground 
stakeholders to assess, develop, implement, and sustain 
nature-positive solutions in agri-food systems to ensure 
income generation, improve biodiversity, and deliver 
a net-positive impact of agriculture on nature. The 
Initiative creates opportunities to access the broader 
food basket through more nutrient-rich crop varieties to 
help develop more resilient and adaptable farming and 
seed systems. The opportunities
To provide strong institutional support in India for a 
transition to nature-based solutions, NATURE+ works to 
enhance income opportunities (particularly for women, 
youth and indigenous peoples) through value chains 
related to seeds, crops, fruit trees, waste, payment for 
ecosystem services, and public procurement. Improved 
restoration and soil management efforts, as well as 
improved recycling value chains, will create highly valued 
carbon sinks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Where NATURE+ works 
In India, the CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive 
Solutions   works in two clusters, Akole and Nandurbar, 
Maharashtra.
NATURE+ study areas in India (represented in terms of 
administrative boundaries).
Outlook 2024
• Development of Nature-Positive Solutions 
Composite Index: A framework or set of indicators 
for land, soil, water (including water quality) and 
agrobiodiversity to measure and assess nature-
positive interventions. Socioeconomic indicators will 
also be included. 
• Launch of NATURE+ Integrated Farming Systems 
(IFS) model farms with research including farm-
level monitoring, data collection, and comparative 
assessments between farms.

RESTORE to date
NATURE+ completed a community-led planting drive on 
communal land, which included local species selected 
by the community. Some 35 hectares and 4,000 saplings 
were planted. NATURE+ built a priority species list of 
237 tree species ideal for restoration and full trait and 
suitability modeling was completed for 177.
RESTORE 2024
The 237 priority tree species will be fully added to the 
Diversity for Restoration tool, and forest restoration 
activities will continue in the clusters. NATURE+ 
and partners will complete a comparative study on 
biodiversity and ecosystem services under grazed and RECYCLE to date
A circular bio-economy innovation hub was launched 
with an accompanying website and the first meeting of 
the hub was conducted with new stakeholders in India. 
Agricultural and livestock waste was identified in micro-
watersheds to explore potential for circular bioeconomy 
activities. The Initiative conducted capacity building on 
agri-livestock waste management in local languages 
and farmers; 80 farmers were trained on management 
strategies.
RECYCLE 2024
The Initiative will continue the development of the 
circular bioeconomy innovation hub and develop a 
technical brief on the hub, along with a training manual 
for biogas. NATURE+ will continue the identification 
of potential stakeholders for the hub. In the selected 
sites, researchers will identify the gaps in the existing 
bioeconomy interventions and will help address these 
gaps through appropriate business models.
ENGAGE to date
NATURE+ collected cross-cutting data for all work 
packages and conducted 1,227 quantitative household 
surveys related to crop area, livestock, income source, 
food, energy, fuel and waste management, along with 
27 community surveys for land use and other services. 
Furthermore, qualitative data collection were collected 
using 20 key informant interviews and 20 focus group 
discussions with men and women farmers and results 
were reported to the NATURE+ Pause and Reflect 
meeting at the end of the year. Natural resource 
mapping for nature-positive solutions was completed.
ENGAGE 2024
The Initiative will complete a preliminary analysis of the 
survey data and a technical report on the quantitative 
results will be prepared. Qualitative results will be 
reported in a discussion paper and journal article 
focused on gender and nature-positive solutions. A 
journal article has been prepared based on mapping 
above-ground carbon storage and sequestration using 
the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and 
Tradeoffs model in a separate watershed that will have 
implications for the NATURE+ sites. CONSERVE and MANAGE 2024
NATURE+ model farms will be created using the 
integrated farming system approach at selected sites. 
The Initiative will develop a composite index to study 
nature-positive indicators for land, soil, water, and 
agrobiodiversity. Support for an existing seed bank in 
Akole cluster will continue, and a new seed bank will be 
developed. The Initiative will support the establishment 
of an on-farm conservation center for Rabi (or “winter” 
crops, which include wheat). Research trials will assess 
drought-tolerant microorganisms, biochar,   and  hydrogel 
impact on the growth and yield of gram (chickpea) under 
drought stress on research plots. The Initiative will do 
measurements of hydro-meteorological parameters 
and installation of equipment at clusters for climate-
smart watershed strategies. Furthermore, 50,000 cactus 
cladodes (cactus shoots) will be planted. CONSERVE and MANAGE to date
NATURE+ established 14 on-farm conservation centers 
focused on Kharif (“autumn”) crops, which include 
dozens of varieties ranging from staple cereals (corn 
and rice) to a plethora of fruits, vegetables, and 
legumes. The Initiative established community-level 
seed production and seed banks for many of these 
crops to reduce dependency on expensive seeds. To 
address water scarcity issues, NATURE+ identified 
and studied three micro-sheds per cluster for soil 
and water conservation research and interventions. 
Management trials on Kharif rice were completed for 
60 demonstration plots. A 100-hectare watershed was 
selected for the implementation of climate-smart and 
nature-positive watershed management strategies.Initiative activities include work on the conservation, 
management, and restoration of traditional and local 
plant species (through sustainable agricultural systems 
called WADIs that integrate agriculture, horticulture 
and forestry) for improved livelihoods and optimal 
use of local resources. Research training, capacity 
building, and assessment of interventions are also key 
to strengthening stakeholder engagement and capacity 
development, focused on nature-positive interventions. 
The Initiative has five work packages: CONSERVE, 
MANAGE, RESTORE, RECYCLE, and ENGAGE.
December 2023 | NATURE+ in India Report 2023 & Outlook 2024How NATURE+  
works in Indianon-grazed forests. Researchers will assess restoration 
impacts on ecosystem services and livelihoods. 
Additionally, the impact of a biogas unit – which 
supplants tree-based energy – on forest conservation 
will be assessed and reported. A national restoration 
workshop will discuss current restoration initiatives and 
gaps with scientists, practitioners, and stakeholders.

"10856","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”

 Executive summary  
Sustainable resource management and biodiversity conservation have become a priority in agricultural 
production. A cross -sectional survey was conducted on 174 households  who were members  of Diet Health 
Clubs ( DHCs) and Value Chain Groups ( VCGs ) using both quantitative and qualitative methods. 
Quantitative data w as collected using the Kobo Toolbox application and analyzed using Stata v15.2 
software, while qualitative info was  recorded in MS Word and analyzed using MS Excel.  
The results showed that the majority of the participants in DHCs and VCGs were female (86%) and former 
members of the NWO project (76.4%). Most of them (over 80%) had attended at least three training 
sessions in the previous time . Over 50% of households experienced land erosion, and the percentage of 
households with good soil quality was very low (upland: 14.5%, lowland: 27.9%, and home garden: 32%). 
On average, each household cultivated approximately 17 different  staple crops  and 10 vegetable ones 
and H'mo ng grew the fewest (14  and 10 respectively ). Households in Mai S on, H'mong, and DHCs grew 
vegetables for sale and applied nature positive solutions ( NPS) fewer than  those in Sa Pa, Dao/Th ai, and 
VCGs.  
Regarding production over the past three months, Mai Son, Thai, and VCG exhibited larger vegetable 
production areas compared to other groups. The majority of households cultivate vegetables in their 
home gardens (86%) and predominantly utilize indigenous vegetable v arieties (almost 78%). While the 
primary focus for farmers is self -consumption, 44% of households still engage in vegetable sales, with a 
concentration in the Dao and VCG groups. On average, each household cultivates nearly 10 types of 
vegetables, includin g three types of DGLV and four other types of vegetables. The Thai group tends to 
cultivate a higher number of DGLV types (4), and the Dao group cultivates more diverse types of other 
vegetables (5) compared to other groups. A majority of households (76%) rely on self -saved vegetable 
seeds for cultivation, but nearly 30% of households face challenges with seed germination. Approximately 
77% of vegetables are used similarly in the last season for sowing purposes in the upcoming plan (82.6%).  
On Nature Positive Solutions  (NPS), many households adopt practices such as nutritional arrangement, 
intercropping, and reducing/eliminating the use of chemical pesticides and disease prevention spraying 
(67.8%, 67.7%, 67.2%, 61.5%), particularly in Sa Pa (92.7%, 89%, 87.8%, 85.4%) a nd the Dao group (90.8%, 
90.8%, 90.8%, 90.8%). Meanwhile, Mai Son (96.7%) and the Thai group (94.8%) have the highest 
percentage of farmers using fertilizers.  
In terms of food consumption, the average diversity food group  score  among  ethnic households was 5, 
the NCD -Protect score was 3, and the NCD -Risk score was 2. Households in Sa Pa and among the H’mo ng 
and Dao ethnic groups had lower diversity and NCD -Protect scores than those of  other groups. 
Additionally, very few households (17%) consumed all five recommended food groups, with this 
percentage being particularly low in the Sa Pa, H'mong, and Dao groups. On the other hand, households 
in Mai S on, Thai , and DH Cs consumed vegetables  fewer  than the community average (73%), but these 
groups had a higher consumption of salty or fried snacks. Conversely, households in Sa Pa and the Dao 
group consumed more sweet foods.  Men played a central role in  decision on  agricultural production, 
purchasing asset, economic development loans, or income utilization.  
In-depth interviews with VCGs revealed that the Van Phuc cooperative had a larger scale and higher 
production costs for commercial vegetable cultivation compared to the Can Ho group, which primarily 
focused on seed production. Both groups faced challenges related to accessing high -quality seeds, harsh 
weather conditions, low prices, land degradation, seed wastage, weak marketing activities, and  limited 
management capacity.  Regarding seed us e, the Van Phuc cooperative relied on sources from companies 
Page 7:
 
 
vii 
 and markets, while the Can Ho group could produce their own seeds for future seasons. Both groups had 
production and marketing plans for their crops but encountered difficulties related to weather, prices, 
and access to input materials, leading to deviatio ns from their plans. Therefore, there is a need to enhance 
the capacity of DHC and VCG members in applying NPSs in production and consuming healthy food groups 
(vegetables, fruits, legumes). In addition, gender equality education for DHC members, expanding  nursery 
production scale, developing local vegetable brands, and strengthening the capacity of VCG management 
should also be prioritized.

 1. Introductio n 
The OneCGIAR  initiative on Nature -positive Solutions for Shifting Agrifood Systems to More Resilient and 
Sustainable Pathways (Nature+) aims to re -imagine, co -create, and implement nature -positive solutions -
based agrifood systems that equitably support food and liveli hoods on the ground, while simultaneously 
ensuring that agriculture is a net positive contributor to nature. Working with stakeholders across 
agriculture, economic, environment, and natural resource management sectors at farm - and community -
level, the init iative will work to meet food demands of growing populations by stewarding biodiversity 
and improving soil and water management with integrated nature -positive solutions. This will include  to 
i) Boost critical ecosystem services and enhance social and economic benefits, including equality. ii) Tackle 
the root economic and political causes of environmental degradation from agricultural production. iii) 
Harness the power of nature -based solution s and ecosystem services alongside advances in digital 
agricultur e and agronomy to reverse negative trends around natural assets, including climate, 
biodiversity, land, and water.  
WP2  will contribute to working with smallholder communities to ensure the sustainable, nature -positive 
management of biodiversity and other natural resources and improve production systems through 
nature -positive innovations, learning, and technologies. This w ill mainly be achieved through i) 
Participatory evaluation of the production and agrobiodiversity and capacity building of farmer groups in 
order to develop the farming systems towards sustainability and diversification and ii) Strengthen ing 
sustainable ve getable value chains to improve quality of produce and farmer household income . 
Understanding the use and potential of nature positive solution s is a possible  entry point for improving 
diversity, sustainability in both pro duction and consumption patterns.  The activities of WP2 in Vietnam 
build on the work by the NWO vegetable seed systems project  with seed/vegetable value chains  groups  
and the diet health clubs, which  align with Nature+. The strong focus on nutrition, market access, and 
women inclusion in the NWO project can be further strengthened, while paying more attention to 
(agro)biodiversity and environmentally friendly principles and practices .  
2. Survey objective s 
The baseline survey was a part of WP2  of Nature+ initiative in Vietnam . Specific objectives of the baseline 
were: 
- Identify  nature positive practice s among ethnic minority households  
- Examine crop diversity in production and dietary diversity in consumption  
3. Methodology  
3.1.  Study design  
This was a cross -sectional descriptive study, combined with qualitative research methods. The qualitative 
research component was conducted simultaneously with the quantitative component, to supplement 
information regarding the advantages and challenges rel ated to the organi zation  and marketing in the 
value chain groups . 
3.2.  Survey respondents and sites  
Quantit ative survey : All p articipants were ethnic household who are members of Diet Health Clubs ( DHCs ) 
and Value Chain Groups ( VCGs ) in Co Noi and Chieng Chan communes (Mai Son district, Son La province) 
and Ngu Chi Son commune (Sa Pa township, Lao Cai province).

 Qualitative s urvey : Management board of  directors of the 02 VCGs:  Van Phuc cooperative  in Co Noi 
commune (Mai Son district, Son La province) and Can Ho seed production group  in Ngu Chi Son commune 
(Sa Pa township, Lao Cai province).  
DHCs were  instituted  and centered around the core of the village women's union —a socio -political 
organization that represents the women's class. These entities play a constructive role in advancing the 
agricultural development process and the establishment of new rural areas. The objective of the DHCs 
was to provide a  platform for capacity building and knowledge and skill exchange on seeds, production, 
and nutrition to enhance utilization and demand  for groups of women at village level. On the other hand, 
VCG s comprise both female  and male farmers engaged in the cultivation and marketing of vegetables and 
vegetable seeds. In the context of the NWO project, VCG aims to augment business revenue derived from 
agricultural products.  
3.3. Survey sample size  
In terms of sample, the baseline survey was conducted with 174 members  from 3 ethnic groups: Thai , 
H’mong , and Dao . The sampled groups were  pre-selected for Nature+ WP2 activities. The detailed sample 
size collected is shown in the table 3.1 below

3.4. Data collection  
Data was collected in July 2023. For recruitment into the survey , FAVRI staff communicated with DHC s 
and VCG s leaders to inform them  about the purpose and interview plan in each village. A list of eligible 
respondents was developed based on the result of group identification (task 1 in WP2). The list included 
group member’s names, their gender, household’s headers, village,  and phone numbers.  
Enumerators  in two study sites were identified  and involved in a 1 day -training course including theory 
and pr actice, on how to administer  the quantitative and qualitative tools . ""The survey tools  were  tested 
in Lech village, C o Noi commune (Mai S on district), and Ta Van Mong village, M uong Hoa commune (Sa 
Pa town), two locations with similar settings to the target ones but not within the survey sites . After the 
pre-test, the questionnaire was linguistically adjusted for appropriateness and logical consistency across  
the questions.  
Page 10:
 
 
3 
 Enumerators reached  out to  the participants for interviews based on the prepared  list. They introduced 
the objectives and content of the survey and  obtained informed  consent before conducting the 
interviews . All quantitative data was collected through the Kobo Toolbox application that was installed on 
the tablets .  
Meanwhile, key-informant -interviews  with the management board of directors of the VCGs were 
conducted by two enumerators  using a semi -structured questionnaire on paper.  
3.5. Data analysis  
For quantitative data , once all data collection was completed , quantitative data  is converted to a Stata  
file for analysis. The analysis was conducted by a researcher of FAVRI  using Stata v15.2 software. T he data 
was fully analyzed to address the research questions/baseline survey objectives. Descriptive statistical 
results are presented in terms of frequencies, proportions, mean values, and standard deviations.  
For qualitative  data , information from the qualitative portion was transcribed and stored as Word files. 
The content of the KIIs was coded and  group ed based on themes, using Excel 201 9. Several important 
details of the subject were extracted to demonstrate the results of the s urvey .

"10965","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

TAFSSA’s district agrifood systems assessment aimed to interview three respondents per household: a female 
adult (aged 20+ years), a male adult (aged 20+ years), and an adolescent (aged 10 -19 years). Information on the 
household and respondent sampling strategy is provided at the end of this data note. 
In this data note, you will first find information on background characteristics of the households and individuals 
who were interviewed. This is followed by information on what  people are eating, which was captured using 
several measurement methods. Respondents were asked about the foods they ate the day before the interview 
(24-hour recall) and about how often they ate certain foods in the past week (food frequency questionnaire). 
The 24 -hour recall was conducted using the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) application, which also captured 
when (at what eating occasion such as breakfast, a snack between lunch and dinner, etc.) people ate each food 
item. 
In addition to what people eat, you will find information in this data note on where  they get their food and, if 
they buy it, what types of markets or shops they buy it from. 
Finally, you will learn why  people choose to eat certain healthy and unhealthy foods. Respondents were asked 
about availability, accessibility, taste, and other factors that may influence their decisions to consume certain 
foods. More details about the measurement methods are found on the following pages.

Fig 3A. Level of household food insecurityFig 3B. Individual FIES items Measuring household food insecurity
Household food insecurity was measured 
using the Food and Agriculture Organization’s 
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). 
Respondents were asked 8 questions about 
their household’s experiences with food in the 
past 30 days. Categories of food security 
(none, mild, moderate, severe) were 
generated based on the number of questions 
with a positive response.

Diet quality scores
Fig 4A. Minimum dietary diversity MEASURING WHAT PEOPLE EAT
Diets were measured by asking people about 
everything they ate or drank on the previous day, 
from the time they woke up until the time they went 
to bed and didn’t eat or drink anything more. This 
includes all snacks and foods and drinks consumed at 
home and outside the home. 
To capture this information, we used the Global Diet 
Quality Score (GDQS) application ( Bromage  et al. 
2021). The GDQS allows us to understand diet quality, 
which is associated with the risk of disease. We report 
the percentage of individuals with at least minimum 
dietary diversity (FAO and FHI 360, 2016) ( Figure 4A ), 
that is those who consume at least 5 of the following 
10 food groups daily: 1) grains, white roots and tubers, 
and plantains, 2) pulses (beans, peas, and lentils), 3) 
nuts and seeds, 4) dairy, 5) meat, poultry, and fish, 6) 
eggs, 7) dark green leafy vegetables, 8) other vitamin 
A-rich fruits and vegetables, 9) other vegetables, and 
10) other fruits. 
We also computed metrics that indicate how healthy 
or unhealthy diets are ( Figure 4B ). Higher GDQS - and 
GDQS+ scores indicate better diet quality. We then 
grouped GDQS scores into 3 categories to indicate 
diet related noncommunicable disease risk ( Figure 
4C).
On the  following pages, we show the percentage of 
individuals who consume various food groups ( Figure 
5), the consumption quantity by food group ( Figure 
6), the most commonly consumed foods ( Figure 7 ), 
how many times per day people eat ( Figure 8 ), who 
eats at various eating occasions ( Figure 9 ).31%

FINDINGS
✓Few individuals consumed “high” quantities of healthy foods except liquid oils; in contrast, few 
individuals consumed “low/none” quantities of unhealthy foods.
✓To reduce the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases, consumption of healthy foods such as

SENTINEL FOODS | In addition to the 
GDQS, which provided information about all foods 
consumed in the previous 24 hours, we selected a set 
of 25 “sentinel foods” to better understand how 
frequently these foods are consumed, food sources, 
where people buy food, and their perceptions about 
food. 
Respondents were asked how frequently they 
consumed these foods in the past 7 days ( Figure 10 ). 
They were also asked about where their household 
gets each food (purchased from outside, own 
production, received from others, received from 
government, gather/forage) ( Figure 11 ). If they said 
their household purchases the food, we asked them 
where it is purchased ( haat , retail shop, farm, 
government ration shop, or other market type) 
(Figure 12 ).
For a few foods, we dug deeper to understand 
people’s food perceptions, or what they think about 
the foods. This included whether they know of a 
vendor who sells the food, if the food is safe to eat, 
easy to acquire near where they spend most of their 
time, is not too expensive, is fast and easy to prepare, 
tastes good, fills their stomach, is nutritious, and if 
their family enjoys eating it ( Figure 13 ). 
Understanding these perceptions provides insights 
into drivers or barriers of consumption of healthy and 
unhealthy foods. Sentinel food list

KEY TAKEAWAYS
1. There is room for improvement in diet quality.
• Consumption of healthy food groups such as whole grains, nuts & seeds, animal -source foods, fruits, 
and deep orange vegetables is low.
• Consumption of  unhealthy food groups such as refined grains/baked goods, biscuits, sweets, and 
sugary tea/coffee is high. 
• Consumption of starchy foods with low nutrient density (rice, potatoes) is high.
• Compared to adults, adolescents are more likely to be at “high” diet related NCD risk.
2. Most households purchase food from markets rather than producing it themselves, though many 
households produce rice.
3. Food purchases are typically from haats , followed by retail shops.
KEY QUESTIONS FOR ACTION
1. What are the key barriers to improving diet quality in the district? 
2. What are a few potential solutions to overcome these barriers? What is needed from decision -makers 
and from program teams to implement these solutions? 
3. How can understanding eating patterns throughout the day and perceptions about healthy and 
unhealthy foods help inform strategies to influence consumption of these foods?
4. What additional information is needed to facilitate actions to improve diets in the district?

SURVEY METHODOLOGY
Village and household sampling
We selected 25 villages in the district with a probability proportional to the number of households that reside in 
each village. Within each village, we conducted a household listing to identify eligible households, that is, those 
with adolescents (10 -19 years old). From the households with adolescents, we randomly invited 20 households to 
participate in the survey. If a household refused, we replaced that household with another randomly selected 
eligible  household, to retain a total of 1,000 households in the district. Thus, the findings reported in this data 
note are representative of rural households from this district that include an adolescent.
Respondent selection
Within households, one adult female aged 20+ years, one adult male aged 20+ years, and one adolescent aged 
10-19 years were selected as the respondents for the survey. When multiple adolescents were living in a 
household, the oldest adolescent was selected. In some households, an adult male was not available (often due 
to migration for work). In such households, the female was the only adult respondent (see Table 1 for 
respondent sample sizes). At the beginning of the interview, the adult in the household primarily involved in 
agriculture (either male or female) and the adult primarily responsible for food purchasing (either male or 
female) were identified as the primary respondents. 
INDICATOR DEFINITIONS
Indicator Definition
GDQS+ The Global Diet Quality Score positive sub -metric is composed of the summed score of the 16 
healthy food groups and ranges from 0 -32 points, with a higher score indicating higher diet 
quality.
GDQS - The Global Diet Quality Score negative sub -metric is composed of the summed score of the 
7 unhealthy food groups and the 2 food groups that are unhealthy when consumed in 
excess amounts (high -fat dairy and red meat), with a higher score indicating lower diet 
quality. The GDQS negative score has a possible range of 0 -17.

"11100","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.

"11154","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

It is a response to ‘top -down’ approaches to sustainable development,  in which power and decision -making 
are in the hands of external development professionals. Instead, the ILMP is based on shared ownership 
of decision -making and the full participation of all stakeholders.  
This ILMP is a product of a collaborative effort between the International Water Management Institute 
(IWMI), the AASWD, and local stakeholders from the Mankran micro -watershed of Ghana. The ILMP 
was developed through a participatory process that involved stakeholders from all sectors, including 
government, civil society, and the private sector. The process began with the creation of a narrative that 
served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management in the Mankran micro -
watershed. The research team then worked with local stakeholders to assess the current state of the 
landscape and identify key challenges and opportunities.   Based on the assessment, the research team and 
stakeholders co -developed a set of management strategies and interventions that are designed to address 
the key challenges and achieve the desired outcomes. The ILMP was designed with a shared vision for the 
landscape : “To sustainably co -harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable manner 
to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano Southwest  District . Based 
on the vision and identified challenges, stakeholders proposed various  response strategies  that included :

 1.0 Introduction  
Landscape management in West and Central Africa faces increasing pressure from deforestation, land 
degradation, poor water management, unsustainable mining, wildlife poaching, and climate change. The 
upsurge in unsustainable land use practices has resulted in ongoing environmental degradation , with 
implication s for the growing demand for food in terms of both quantity and quality, competition for 
productive land, urban expansion, demand for forest resources, demand for water resources, wildfires, soil 
health (indicated by lower nutrient status and organic content), fores t ecosystems, and water resources. 
Coupled with the mounting impacts o f anthropogenic climate change, this trend is projected to exacerbate 
exposure and vulnerability of production and livelihoods in this agrifood system, threatening its resilience.  
 
The above context justifies the urgent need for a sustainable and inclusive approach to landscape 
management. Inclusive landscape management plans (ILMP) emphasize the integration of social and 
ecological systems, local participation, and sustainable resou rce use and management within landscapes 
(Albert et al. 2014). The approach focuses on ensuring the inclusivity of decision -making processes, 
valuing diverse perspectives, and addressing power imbalances among stakeholders . The inclusive 
approach is based on shared ownership of decision -making. It is a response to ‘top -down’ approaches to 
sustainable development, in which power and decision -making is in the hands of external development 
professionals. Participation is key in advancing sustainable developmen t and considering the social 
context. Sustainable development allows for the improvement of everyone's quality of life while preserving 
and developing the natural resources on which life depends. Because problems involving unsustainable 
resource use are of ten complex and frequently need compromises and trade -offs, processes that involve 
full participation from all stakeholders typically yield the best and most lasting results. Consequently, 
success stories of inclusive landscape management depict large -scale initiatives co mprising stakeholders 
implementing coordinated interventions across a variety of land uses for a desired effect and impact.  
 
This ILMP seeks to provide a framework for the inclusive participation of stakeholders in the sustainable 
management and development of landscape s in the Ahafo Ano Southwest  District (AASWD) for socio -
economic and environmental benefits  (See Figure 1 for map of AASWD) . By prioritizing inclusivity, this 
landscape management plan aims to create a more harmonious and sustainable relationship between 
communities, ecosystems, and development, fostering resilience and equitable benefits for all. This 
strategic plan defines a broader shared vision, objectives , and a road map that would aid all stakeholders 
and institutions to contribute to the effective and sustainable management of natural resources in the 
AASWD. This would also guide the AASWD to prepare their own investment action plans towards 
achieving the overall vision. The landscape management strategy would also provide a strategic framework 
that Medium Term Development Plans  (MTDPs) of the district could link up to achieve their climate 
change and environmental/natural resources management obligations as provided by the National 
Development Planning Commission Guidelines for the preparation of MTDP.  There is also the Ghana 
Cocoa Forest REDD+  Programme (GCFRP) , which represents an innovative, unique, and highly ambitious 
programme  to reduce deforestation  and degradation in a sub -national landscape of approximately 5.9 
million ha  in Ghana.  Given that the AASWD landscape falls within the area earmarked for the 
implementation of this programme , this ILMP  also explores opportunities for building synergies and 
model s the target  landscape around the Hotspot Intervention Area (HIA) concept to benefit from the 
programme. The shared land scape vision and the elements of th is ILMP are also in line with Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) , which are the global blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future 
for all.

2.0 Methodology  
The IL MP for AASWD prescribe s an inclusive, action -oriented , and collaborative process targeted at 
delivering on the aspiration of stakeholders towards a future of social and economic progress under a 
robust natural resource management system. These principles also reflect  in the Medium -Term  
Development Plans (MTDPs) of the AASWD , Ghana’s Land degradation Neutrality  (LDN)  targets , and 
national  sustainable development priorities and targets. The key elements of this ILMP  include:  
• Shared or agreed management objectives that encompass multiple benefits from the landscape  
• Field, farm , and forest practices designed to contribute to multiple objectives, including human 
well-being, food production, climate change mitigation, and conservation of biodiversity and 
ecosystem services . 
• Ecological, social, and economic interactions among various  parts of the landscape are managed 
to realize positive synergies among interests and actors or to mitigate negative trade -offs 
• Collaborative, community -engaged processes for dialogue, planning, negotiating and monitoring 
decisions are in place . 
• Markets and public policies are contextualized  to achieve the diverse set of landscape objectives 
and institutional requirements . 
The ILMP  development  followed  the iterative  and non-linear  inclusive  planning  framework  (See Tilahun  
et al. 2023;  Atampugre  et al. 2023)  that involves  the following  key components  (See Figure  2 for a 
simplified  illustration ):  
• Definition  of goals  and objectives . 
Page 9:

 • Stakeholders  mapping  and identification  of key challenges  and demand  driven  intervention

Step 1: Narrative development  
The initial step of co -developing the Inclusive Landscape Management Plan (ILMP) was to create a 
narrative that served as a broad objective for promoting inclusive landscape management to enhance the 
current landscape state. A research team from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) 
together with identified regional and local stakeholder s evaluated the social ecological sustainability of the 
social ecological landscape and envisioned future strategies. To initiate this process, a suitable micro -
watershed for action was identified and this involved local stakeholders in areas facing socio -ecological 
challenges. This local involvement was essential for addressing issues related to land and water resource 
management, aiming to improve food security, income, and nutrition. The AASWD played a crucial role 
in integrating these efforts into their  plans, so their involvement in this first step was fundamental. Key 
stakeholders collaborated to define a target landscape that aligns with the narrative's goals. Accordingly, 
a micro -watershed in the Mankran watershed was co -identified  (Figure 3) .

Step 2: Resource unit assessment  
Once the Mankran micro -watershed was identified, the next step was to map competing resource units and 
establish local expert groups to represent these resource systems. The research team guided the local 
experts in co -creating inventories of critical elem ents related to land use and ecosystem services within the 
landscape. They also co -identified site -specific indicators for landscape situational analysis ( See 
Atampugre et al. 2022 a) and the assessments of future landscape performance. Citizen scientists w ere 
employed to conduct hydrological and water quality assessments different land use categories , i.e., f orest, 
agriculture,  and degraded  areas  (See Figure 4).

Step 3: Co -design , visualization , and documentation of ILMP  
The third step of the process was to develop a mid -term ILMP for the AASWD. This involved three 
workshops with the regional and community expert groups  (involving 67 participants , See Figure 5), 
focusing on  landscape challenges and vision, with emphasis on  management strategies, resource 
allocation, assigning responsibilities, and financial considerations. The workshops began with a briefing 
on the current landscape challenges  in plenary . The FGDs were organised based on gender to ensure equal 
participation and promote freedom of expression (considering the cultural setup in communities). I ssues

 related to GESI were duly considered to  enhance inclusivity.  Resource users and other stakeholders then 
co-defined a common landscape vision and specific objectives with associated strategies. The final plan 
was generated by integrating various stakeholders' perspectives  (Appendix  A and B  for detailed workshop 
plan).

Considering that this is a living ILMP, there will several follow -up activities involving piloting and testing 
of certain  technology  and innovation bundles  that were identified during the co -design phase (Step 3) . As 
part of this will be an  extensive co -validation process to evaluate the suitability and efficacy of the 
strategies . There will also be activities related to impact evaluation of ILMP interventions using the SI 
framework to measure improvements in social -ecological landscape objectives /goals . This is to facilitate 
ongoing learning and communication among stakeholders involved in landscape management.  It is also 
expected that there will be an effort to scaling out ILMP  process and its interventions  to Greater Ahafo 
Ano area . The goal is to create an inclusive and sustainable development plan that ensures the ongoing 
maintenance of landscapes and provides guidance for accommodating recent  changes driven by social, 
economic, and environmental processes. The scaling out strategies include , but not limited to, the 
following  key elements:  
• Involving Local Government: Engaging the local government as a facilitator right from the 
beginning of the process.  
• Continuous Stakeholder Engagement: Maintaining ongoing engagement with key stakeholders.  
• Presentation at Local and National Levels: Sharing the co -design process at both local and national 
levels to gain broader support.  
To scale any intervention bundles from the plan, various existing approaches may be  used:  participatory 
innovation platforms, adaptive scaling strategi es, multi -sectoral platforms, and  food system accelerator 
challenge. These strate gies must be  tailored to specific intervention s being scaled to ensure their successful 
integration into the broader  productive  landscape.

 3.0 Landscape Situational Analysis  in Ahafo Ano Southwest  District  
Using the DPSIR -SEL framework  (See Atampugre et al. 2022 b), a mix of methods, and the micro -
watershed in the Mankran watershed in the Ahafo Ano Southwest  District (AASWD) as a case, the 
research team conducted landscap e situational analysis (LSA) . The LSA aimed at giving an overview of 
how drivers and pressures combine to delineate the Social Ecological Landscape (SEL) state and impacts, 
highlighting the institutional responses. The driving forces behind the pressures that define the state of and 
impacts on the landscape are local, albeit a few national and global  drivers (Figure 6 for a summary of the 
LSA findings). The LSA showed that unregulated small -scale mining, large -scale wood exploitation, and 
the conversion of forest ecosystems into farms and plantations are growing threats to the health and 
function of the landscape (Figure 5). These activities are driven by  poverty, limited livelihood alternatives, 
and high demand for ecological resources. The impacts of these activities include food insecurity, 
biodiversity loss, livelihood destruction, and ecosystem de gradation.  The research found that human 
activities are destroying the landscape and livelihoods, and this is leading to poverty, food insecurity, and 
environmental degradation. People are increasingly dependent on outside sources of food and water, and 
wild foods are  becoming scarce. The river is polluted,  and the forest is fragmented.

     Source:  Atampugre et al. (2022 a) 
The study also showed that most of the governance/management responses in the AASWD operate at 
multiple scales and are led by multiple actors and stakeholders. Scales of operation are at district, regional, 
and national levels, with few management platforms at the community lev el. Actors in this context include 
local people at the community level, unit committees, non -governmental organizations (NGOs), local 
governments (district assembly), national government agencies and departments, and international 
agencies. Predominant sta keholders within the AASWD (and, by extension, the Offin sub -basin SEL) were 
local people (resource users) represented by unit committees, local go vernment authorities (AAWSDA  and 
its departments and units) and government ministries and agencies (water resources commission, forestry 
commission, Community water and sanitation, etc.). NGOs and international institutions/agencies had a  
Page 13:
 13 
 limited presence in the area. The analysis showed  that there is extremely  limited coordination 
between/among these actors, resulting in counter -productive management initiatives. Production sectors 
in the district operate in isolation, which  inhibits integrated management of production systems and the 
natural resources that underpin ecosystem services needed for all the sectors. The results also showed that 
low institutional capacity, including inadequate human and financial capacity, limited  access to 
information about natural resources/ecosystem services for proper planning, and the lack of tools and 
approaches for mapping, assessing, monitoring, and practically integrating ecosystem services (ES) to 
support planning, tend to hinder integrated landscape ma nagement in the AASWD.  
4.0 Shared  landscape vision,  co-defined objectives,  and strategies  
From the situational analysis, as presented above, the AASWD needs a common vision on Inclusive 
landscape management, which they currently lack. There are several  institutions such as Governmental, 
Traditional Authorities, Farmers, Civil Society Organizations, including Development Partners and the 
Private Sector, who can play various roles in achieving  a common vision. There are also existing strategies, 
policies and regulations that could guide effective landscape management if well implemented through 
effective coordination by the local government authorities. Th us, a common landscape vision was 
discussed after members were presented with what they considered as the existing landscape situation in 
the district. After careful and lengthy deliberations, the stakeholders agreed to have the following as a 
common landscap e vision:  
""To sustainably co -harness landscape resources in a transparent and accountable 
manner to engender resilient communities and healthy ecosystems in the Ahafo Ano 
South West  District .” 
Five domains were conceptualized to aid in achieving the common vision. These domains were production, 
socio -economic, human,  and crosscutting , environment , and institutional. Based on these domains, 
stakeholders were asked to prioritize two to six specific objectives in the context of co -identified landscape 
challenges (Table 1). These served as a guide i n co-developing these inclusive landscape management 
strategies  (See Section 5.0 and Appendix  A). Under Section 5.0  below , the se specific strategies are 
categorized into sustainable agricultural interventions; sustainable forestry management strategies; 
sustainable water resources management strategies; susta inable mining strategies; transformational 
decision -making and governance; empowerment and livelihood enhancement strategies; collaborative 
partnerships and resource mobilization; crosscutting  issues; and communication and awareness creation.

4.1 Mapping shared landscape vision and strategies  
As part of developing the inclusive landscape management plan for Ahafo Ano South west District 
(AASWD), stakeholders, including chiefs, heads of district assembly departments and units, community 
members and experts from FORIG, WRC, Forestry Department, CSIR -SRI, CSIR -CRI, KNUST, UCC, 
were mixed up and put into five groups for participa tory mapping exercises. The participatory mapping 
exercises were in  two phases . The initial participatory mapping exercise began with participants mapping 
the district's curr ent state using a legend they co -developed. They were provided with a base map of the

"8581","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Reference Diet Deprivation (ReDD) index: a tool to measure diet quality and explore how policies are driving dietary change The Reference Diet Deprivation (ReDD) index is estimated from household consumption survey data and measures the incidence, breadth, and depth of diet deprivation (the voluntary or involuntary shortfall in consumption) across multiple food groups. It can be used to compare diet quality across households or populations or track changes in diet quality over time. The advantage of the ReDD index is that it can be integrated into an economic model to examine changes in diet quality under different food and agriculture policy scenarios or external shocks. More recently, the ReDD index has been used as part of the underlying data for the Food Security Simulator, a tool for assessing the potential short-term impacts of food price or household income shocks on food security and people’s diets. It is showing to be a useful tool for researchers and decisionmakers to assess diet quality and examine the drivers of dietary change.  URL: https://hdl.handle.net/10568/130616

Existing indicators emphasize the cost and affordability of healthy diets but have not attempted to measure how far households are from ideal diets or how policies may nudge them closer to them. We propose a new Reference Diet Deprivation (ReDD) index, estimated from household consumption survey data, that measures the incidence, breadth, and depth of diet deprivation across multiple food groups. While informative as a standalone measure, we demonstrate how the ReDD index can be integrated into an economic model to examine changes in diet quality under different policy or external shocks. Our Nigerian case study shows that productivity growth in the dairy, pulse & nut, fruit, and red meat value chains have more potential than staple crops to reduce diet deprivation. While these findings have implications for food and agricultural policy prioritization in Nigeria, the study more importantly demonstrates the usefulness of the ReDD index for assessing diet quality and examining the drivers of dietary change when used in conjunction with a simulation model.

We first assess the likely impacts of COVID-19 shocks in Bangladesh and Myanmar on poverty and food and nutrient consumption gaps. We then analyze the estimated mitigating effects of five hypothetical social protection interventions of a typical monetary value: (1) cash transfers; (2) in-kind transfers of common rice; (3) in-kind transfers of fortified rice enriched with multiple essential micronutrients; (4) vouchers for a diversified basket of rice and non-staple foods; and (5) food vouchers with fortified rice instead of common rice. The simulation results suggest modest effectiveness of the cash transfers for mitigating poverty increases and little effectiveness of all five transfers for preventing increasing food and nutrient consumption gaps among the poorest 40%. Rice fortification is, however, effective at closing key micronutrient consumption gaps and could be a suitable policy instrument for averting hidden hunger during economic crises.

Most Kenyans simply cannot afford a healthy diet. Accelerated poverty reduction will have important nutritional benefits. Second, there are large differences between the costs of meeting dietary guidelines for highly nutritious foods and the costs of obtaining adequate amounts of calorie-dense staple foods. These cost gaps have a strong effect on household diets because the food choices of many Kenyan households are primarily driven by a need to satisfy calorie requirements. This points to a problem of relative food prices, which interacts with the poverty problem. It is most apparent for animal-source protein foods and, to a lesser degree, for vegetables. Thus, policy interventions and technological innovations that address this relative food price problem are needed to narrow the consumption gaps for nutritious food groups, particularly animal-source foods and vegetables. Third, the food preferences of Kenyans show that the poor-quality diets consumed by many households are not solely due to insufficient purchasing power and high prices for nutritious foods. This is most obvious for plant-based protein foods  pulses and nuts  which have low prices per calorie, but which few households consume in sufficient amounts to meet the recommended healthy intake. This weak consumer preference for such foods suggests a lack of knowledge of their nutritional value and their importance for healthy diets. Nutrition education may aid in changing consumer behavior to increase the consumption of pulses and nuts, as well as other nutritious foods that are now underconsumed relative to the healthy reference diet. Kenyans can consume more healthy diets with their current incomes. While healthy diets are costly for many Kenyan households, changes can be made in the current typical diet to achieve better and more balanced nutrient intake at the same cost. Finally, policies aimed at promoting food systems transformation in Kenya should factor in the dietary needs of Kenyans. As agriculture is the dominant sector in Kenyas food systems, a balance must be found between traditional objectives including productivity growth, export stimulation, and farmer support, on the one hand, and the new responsibility of improving the availability of nutrient-dense foods for better nutrition and health for all Kenyans, on the other.

A HEALTHY DIET IS COSTLY,   BUT EVEN WITH LIMITED   INCOME KENYANS CAN   EAT BETTER  Olivier Ecker, Andrew R. Comstock,   andKarlPauw    
G lobally, poor-quality diets are the leading cause of all forms of malnutrition. The drivers of malnutrition have become more complex in recent decades with the simultaneous occurrence of both under- and overconsumption of food and nutri- ents within the same populations and even within the same households. Kenya is no exception  19 percent of children under five years of age are stunted in their growth while simultaneously about one-third of women aged 15 to 49 are overweight or obese (UNICEF et al. 2021; KNBS et al. 2015). Malnutrition causes lifelong health challenges for those directly affected and is associated with high social and eco- nomic costs for households, communities, and societies (Popkin et al. 2006; Victora et al. 2008).
However, the food preferences of Kenyans and how their food choices change when food prices or their incomes change also determine whether their diets are as healthy as they could be. These drivers of diet quality can be targeted by various policy instruments and technological innovations to shift food choices toward nutritious foods that, if consumed more, would result in diets that improve the health and qual- ity of life of many Kenyans.
DIETARY PATTERNS AND QUALITY
In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission proposed a global reference diet that meets nutritional require- ments and reduces the incidence of diet-related disease and mortality (Willet et al. 2019). This healthy reference diet provides guidelines on optimal food intake in both grams and calories for multiple food groups. The reference calorie intakes are not strict caloric thresholds that individual consumers must achieve, but rather provide benchmarks for the make-up of a diverse and balanced diet that would provide adequate amounts of essential macro- and micronutrients for most people. We use these
We examine the nutritional quality of Kenyan diets, the affordability of healthy diets in Kenya, and Kenyan food preferences.1 Understanding current dietary patterns and the gaps between actual food con- sumption levels and healthy levels is an important starting point for identifying how those diets can be improved. For the poor across Kenya, the relatively high cost of a diverse and nutritionally adequate food basket prevents them from consuming healthy diets.
1 Our analysis uses data from the nationally representative 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS). Over 12,300 rural, 2,500 peri-urban, and 5,300 urban households make up the analytical sample. The food groups examined are constructed from 196 food items that survey households reported consuming at home.

IFPRI POLICY BRIEF | JUNE 2023

Figure 1. Mean daily calorie consumption amounts per adult equivalent in Kenya by area of residence and major food group, compared to the healthy reference diet
optimal, food-group-specific calorie intakes as the reference intakes for our dietary analysis.
For purposes of comparison, we use the major food groups of the EAT-Lancet reference diet but com- bine two groups (grains and starchy roots/tubers) into starchy staples. The other groups are vege- tables; fruits; plant-based proteins (i.e., pulses and nuts); animal-source proteins (i.e., meat, fish, and eggs); dairy foods; added fats and oils; and added sugars. We also added a discretionary foods group that includes snacks, sweets, and beverages, which is not part of the reference diet. These foods are nutri- tionally non-essential and possibly unhealthy. The reference diet is scaled for a total daily intake of 2,500 kilocalories (kcal)  the healthy intake of a moder- ately active, average-sized adult. Household food consumption in our analysis is therefore based on cal- ories per adult equivalents in the household.

The average calorie consumption of Kenyans from each food group is presented in Figure 1, disaggre- gated by rural, peri-urban, and urban residence. The graph also shows the recommended consumption lev- els for each food group as specified in the EAT-Lancet healthy reference diet. Overall the differences in the average dietary patterns across rural, peri-urban, and urban groups are small. On average, Kenyans do not consume enough calories in total. Moreover, the calo- ries they consume primarily come from starchy staples, with far smaller contributions from other food groups. As a result, the share of calories in the average Kenyan diet coming from each food group differs significantly from the healthy reference diet, suggesting their diets are unbalanced and of poor quality overall. Specifically, Kenyan diets are lacking vegetables, fruits, plant-based proteins, and animal-source proteins, in both relative and absolute quantities. However, the consumption of added sugars exceeds the guideline amount of the healthy reference diet by about one-third.

The average gaps in calorie consumption amounts for the major nutritious food groups relative to the healthy reference diet are graphed in Figure 2. The two pro- tein food groups show the largest gaps. However, the gaps are also relatively large for fruits, vegetables, and dairy.

of households have intakes of plant-based and ani- mal-source protein foods, vegetables, and fruit that fall short of the reference intakes of the healthy reference diet.2 Moreover, poor diet quality is common every- where in Kenya  when examined by rural, peri-urban, and urban residence, almost all households in each area consume less than the reference intakes for at least one of these six nutritious food groups.
At the 2015/16 price levels shown in Figure 3, the median daily cost of the healthy reference diet is about KES 110 in rural areas, KES 123 in peri-urban areas, KES 141 in urban areas, and KES 120 nationally. These costs are considerably higher than the official food poverty lines for rural (KES 69 per adult equiva- lent per day) and peri-urban and urban (KES 84) areas (KNBS et al. 2018). Official estimates suggest almost one-third of Kenyans have total food expenditures below the respective food poverty lines; given the difference, it is unsurprising that many more Kenyan households cannot afford the healthy reference diet  three-quarters of both rural and peri-urban households and 65 percent of urban households reported total food expenditures below the median cost of the healthy reference diet for their area of residence (Headey et al. 2023). Healthy diets are very costly for many consumers in Kenya, as well as throughout sub-Saharan Africa (Hirvonen et al. 2020).
DIET COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
Large consumption gaps for nutritious foods in Kenya reflect the high costs of a healthy diet relative to house- hold incomes. The median prices for the major food groups of the healthy reference diet in Kenya, expressed in Kenyan shillings (KES) per 100 kcal, are graphed in Figure 3. Animal-source proteins are by far the most expensive food group  about 13 times the price of starchy staples and 10 times the price of plant-based proteins. While the calories provided by animal-source proteins are only a small part of the nutritional value of these foods, this price comparison demonstrates the problem of food affordability when satisfying caloric needs is the primary concern guiding the food choices of most households. Similarly, vegetables are micro- nutrient-dense, but generally not calorie-dense, so food-insecure households do not consume as much of these foods as is required for a healthy diet.
FOOD PREFERENCES AND CONSUMPTION RESPONSES
High prices for nutritious foods are one of the princi- pal constraints to poor Kenyan households improving their diets, particularly when their calorie require- ments are often unmet (Headey and Alderman 2019; Headey et al. 2023). However, many Kenyans
2 For the food groups that show significant gaps in average consumption relative to the healthy reference diet, many households reported zero consumption over the surveys seven-day food consumption recall period.

because of differing food environments between rural and urban areas. In contrast, the price elasticities are closer between rural and urban households for most food groups, which implies responses to food price changes will be similar across the two areas.
overconsume total calories, particularly empty calo- ries from sugary products. Plant-based proteins such as pulses and nuts are relatively cheap sources of pro- teins and micronutrients, as well as calories. Yet, these foods are vastly underconsumed, especially in urban areas, reflecting weak consumer preferences for these foods relative to other food groups.
Several insights can be drawn from the patterns of income elasticities across food groups and between rural and urban households, including on household preferences for consuming calorie-dense staples and consuming meat rather than pulses and nuts for pro- tein intake.
While consumer preferences cannot be observed directly, they can be inferred from how consum- ers change their consumption of specific foods in response to changes in incomes or prices  that is, their income and price elasticities of food consump- tion (demand). Higher incomes tend to result in increased food consumption, while higher prices tend to result in lower consumption. Estimated income and price elasticities of demand by food group are pre- sented in Table 1. Differences are seen in the income elasticities between rural and urban households
 For rural households, income elasticities for pulses and nuts are above the income elasticity of total food demand. With higher incomes, consumption of these plant-based protein foods can be expected to increase faster than the consumption of other food groups.

applied to the price of these foods to reduce house- hold consumption.
 Urban income elasticity estimates suggest that urban income growth will increase the consumption of meat and fruits faster than total food consump- tion. Slower increases will be seen for pulses and nuts  evidence of a weak preference for such foods among urban consumers.
 Nutritious food groups for which consumption is price-sensitive include dark green leafy vegeta- bles, fruit, and pulses and nuts. Public investments to support stable prices for these foods throughout the year would help bring their consumption closer to recommended healthy intake levels.
 In urban households, maize is the food group with the smallest income elasticity. This reflects Bennetts Law  as per capita incomes rise, the share of calories from staple foods declines. However, in rural areas, the income elasticity for maize is similar to that for total food demand. This pattern confirms that assuring adequate calorie consumption is a central driver of rural consumers food choices.
CONCLUSIONS
Four important implications for policy to promote and guide a transformation toward healthy diets for all Kenyans can be drawn from this research:
Price elasticity patterns across the food groups are less clear than for the income elasticities  for most food groups, the price elasticity estimate is close to that for the total food average. Nevertheless, there are some patterns of note.
First, Kenyas diet problem  the underconsumption of nutritious foods and increasingly high consumption of calorie-rich but micronutrient-sparse foods  is pri- marily a poverty problem. Most Kenyans simply cannot afford a healthy diet. Accelerated poverty reduction will have important nutritional benefits.
 The consumption of beverages and sugar is sen- sitive to price changes. Hence, taxation of these non-essential foods may be a way to curb their over- consumption. However, because their prices per calorie are low, significant taxes would need to be
Second, there are large differences between the costs of meeting dietary guidelines for highly nutritious foods and the costs of obtaining adequate amounts of calorie-dense staple foods. These cost gaps have

a strong effect on household diets because the food choices of many Kenyan households are primarily driven by a need to satisfy calorie requirements. This points to a problem of relative food prices, which interacts with the poverty problem. It is most appar- ent for animal-source protein foods and, to a lesser degree, for vegetables. Thus, policy interventions and technological innovations that address this relative food price problem are needed to narrow the con- sumption gaps for nutritious food groups, particularly animal-source foods and vegetables.
knowledge of their nutritional value and their impor- tance for healthy diets. Nutrition education may aid in changing consumer behavior to increase the consumption of pulses and nuts, as well as other nutritious foods that are now underconsumed relative to the healthy reference diet. Kenyans can consume more healthy diets with their current incomes. While healthy diets are costly for many Kenyan households, changes can be made in the current typical diet to achieve better and more balanced nutrient intake at the same cost.
Finally, policies aimed at promoting food systems transformation in Kenya should factor in the dietary needs of Kenyans. As agriculture is the dominant sec- tor in Kenyas food systems, a balance must be found between traditional objectives including productiv- ity growth, export stimulation, and farmer support, on the one hand, and the new responsibility of improv- ing the availability of nutrient-dense foods for better nutrition and health for all Kenyans, on the other.
Third, the food preferences of Kenyans show that the poor-quality diets consumed by many households are not solely due to insufficient purchasing power and high prices for nutritious foods. This is most obvi- ous for plant-based protein foods  pulses and nuts  which have low prices per calorie, but which few households consume in sufficient amounts to meet the recommended healthy intake. This weak con- sumer preference for such foods suggests a lack of

Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2).

Introduction
The intensity and frequency of drought has been increasing in Ethiopia with welfare-harming impacts for millions of people. For example, the 2015 drought, which was associated with an El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event aected 9.7 million people in the central and northern parts of the country. The drought impacted pre-existing fragile Ethiopian communities that were already relatively lower ranked in key welfare indicators compared to other regions, further exacerbating existing socio-economic inequities. Overall, the eects of the drought on the national economy were modest, with a dip in national GDP by 1.6 percent and agricultural GDP by 3.6 percent according to Koo et al. (2019), partly because the relative spatial concentration of the drought was skewed to traditionally lower productivity areas (Warner and Mann, 2018).
The spatial distribution of the drought masked its severity for the approximately 10 million people who were subjected to its adverse impacts and did not have the ability to withstand a drought that was reported to be the worst in ve decades (Sohnesen, 2020). The eect of the 2015 drought has not been widely studied, except for Hirvonen, Sohnesen, and Bundervoet (2020) who analyzed its eect on nutritional status of children, Sohnesen (2020) on consumption, and Koo et al. (2019) on national and agricultural GDP. The current study contributes to our understanding of the eect of the 2015 drought on net crop income, cultivated area, average daily food expenditure, household dietary diversity, and market participation. The study also explores whether access to irrigation has helped farmers withstand the adverse eects of drought.
Using nationally representative panel data collected in 2012 and 2016 from households that were and were not aected by the drought, we estimate a dierence-in-dierences (DID) regression to explore the eects of the drought and its heterogeneous eects by irrigation status. The study used recent developments in the DID literature to estimate doubly robust DID that allows the parallel trend assumption to be conditioned on selected baseline characteristics that can determine the evolution of the outcome variables with bootstrap procedures that allow for asymptotically valid inference (SantAnna and Zhao, 2020; Callaway and SantAnna, 2021).
As expected, the results show that the 2015 drought particularly aected rainfed farmers. The net crop income of rainfed farmers declined by 37 percent (4,250 Ethiopian Birr in real 2012 prices
2
or US$2391), the size of land they cultivate decreased by 0.12 hectares, their household dietary
diversity score dropped by 0.17, and the share of crop harvest sold to the market dropped by 10 percent. On the other hand, irrigating farmers, that were in drought aected areas, managed to increase their daily expenditure on food by 72 percent (an increase of 23 Ethiopian Birr in real 2012 prices or US$ 1.3), maintain their net crop income, size of cultivated land, household dietary diversity, and share of harvest sold to market. In other words, while rainfed agricultural producers suered sharp declines in welfare, those farmers with access to irrigation maintained, their economic status. The results provide quantitative evidence concerning the role of irrigation as an important climate smart agricultural intervention to improve the resilience of farming households in the face of major shocks such as the 2015 ENSO drought.
2 Drought, Irrigation, and Resilience
Drought is an insidious natural hazard that is caused by signicant reduced amounts of precipitation than what is generally considered normal for the area. The interdependence between climatic, hydrologic, geomorphic, ecological, and societal variables makes it dicult to adopt a denition that completely describes the drought phenomenon and associated impacts (Zeleke et al., 2017). Because of this, drought has several denitions; the central element is the decit compared to the normal, or mean, amount of precipitation over an extended period such as a season, a year, or several years. Meteorological drought is characterized by a shortage of precipitation and represents a departure of precipitation from its climatological value calculated over a reference period.
Rainfall in the Horn of Africa is inuenced by weather systems that develop in the Pacic Ocean, especially the central and east-central parts of the Pacic around the Equator. One of the main factors driving these systems is the temperature of the Pacics surface, which aects the air pressure above the sea, and related wind and rainfall patterns across large areas of the tropics and sub-tropics. Relatively large changes in the seas temperature create unusual weather patterns, such as drought or excessive rainfall and storms (Catley, Cullis, and Abebe, 2016).
While some research has been done concerning drought in Ethiopia, much of the work has focused on the meteorological predictive aspects, or macroeconomic impacts, rather than specic

household impacts. Some of those studies determine specic causes of drought (Camberlin, 1997;
Diro, Grimes, and Black, 2011) and others provide predictive algorithms for drought (Gissila et al., 2004). According to Camberlin (1997), monsoon activity over India is a major trigger for JulySeptember rainfall variability in the East African highlands. A strong monsoon, depicted by low sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies in Bombay, corresponds to an increase in rainfall in the East African highlands, while weak monsoon conditions correspond to below-normal rainfall. Diro, Grimes, and Black (2011) investigate the relationship between global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and rainfall in Ethiopia. Their nding shows that Ethiopian rainfall is negatively associated with both the Indian Ocean and Eastern Pacic SST. According to Diro, Grimes, and Black (2011), summer rainfall over the Ethiopian highlands is positively correlated with the equatorial East Pacic sea-level pressure and the southern oscillation index and negatively correlated with sea surface temperature (SST)2 over the tropical eastern Pacic Ocean. High-positive SST (El Nio)3 anomalies during the summer are associated with high drought probability over most of the agriculturally productive land and major water reservoir areas of Ethiopia (Degefu, 1987). All of this research indicates that excess rainfall tends to occur when there is a La Nina, and rain decits occur when there is an El-Nino. Research by Gissila et al. (2004), focus on the development of a seasonal forecasting model for the Ethiopian summer rains using SST data for March, April and May in the Indian and Pacic Oceans. The research indicates that Ethiopian rainfall is highly variable, both temporally and spatially, and should be analyzed in clusters rather than as a whole. Incorporating Indian and Pacic SSTs in the March, April and May leading to the June, July, August, September (JJAS) rainy season can be used to develop a skillful forecast for part of Ethiopia. While improved rainfall predictions are critical for forecasting, developing drought indexes are also important for
measuring relative deviations from expected precipitation.
Many denitions and related mathematical tools have been developed to measure drought. The most widely used mathematical tools developed are the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) (Palmer, 1965) and standardized precipitation index (SPI) (McKee et al., 1993). The PDSI is a soil moisture algorithm that includes terms for water storage and evaporation, whereas the SPI is a probability index based only on precipitation.
2Sea surface temperature (SST) is dened as the temperature of the sea close to its surface. 3El Nio  a warming of the central Pacic Ocean leading to high-pressure weather systems.

The SPI, often called the Z-score (Khan, Gabriel, and Rana, 2008), is the number of standard deviations from the rainfall mean collected over a designated time period. For precipitation, high positive values correspond to wet periods and high negative values correspond to rain deciency periods. McKee et al. (1993) used SPI as a classication system to dene drought intensities. A drought event occurs any time the SPI is continuously negative and reaches an intensity of -1.0 or less. The event ends when the SPI turns positive.
Wu et al. (2001) did an evaluation of the standard precipitation index (SPI), the China Z- Index (CZI), and the statistical Z-score. The result indicates that the Z-score can provide results that are statistically similar to SPI for all time scales. This is advantageous because the Z-score is relatively easier to compute. According to Wu et al. (2001), the Z-score does not require tting the data to either the Gamma or Pearson Type III distributions and we therefore adopt the z-score methodology for our purposes. WMO (2012) provided a categorization of drought based Z-scores of rainfall as shown in Table 1. In order to construct appropriate drought indexes, we rst determine typical seasonal rainfall patterns for appropriate seasonal aggregations.
Table 1: Categorization of drought based on Z-score (SPI) values
Z-score (SPI) values 2.0+ extremely wet 1.5 to 1.99 very wet 1.0 to 1.49 moderately wet -.99 to .99 Near normal -1.0 to -1.49 Moderately dry -1.5 to -1.99 Severely dry -2 and less Extremely dry

Ethiopia has two major rainy seasons. The Belg season generally lasts from February to May and provides rainfall for agriculture in central Ethiopia. About 10 percent of the Ethiopian population depend on the Belg rainy season (Degefu, 1987). The kiremt or Meher rains are more reliable and run from June to mid-September, providing conditions suitable for agriculture for most regions of the country. The Meher rains support 92 percent of total area cultivated and 97 percent of total crop production in the country (Taesse et al., 2012). Hence, a rain failure during the Meher season can more substantially increase in food insecurity for those aected by the drought with
5
broad adverse impacts on the rest of the economy.
In June 2015, Ethiopias National Meteorological Agency (NMA) declared that the Belg rains had failed. Soon after, the kiremt rains were severely delayed and became erratic, directly aecting 9.7 million Ethiopians (Jjemba, Singh, and Arrighi, 2017). The drought areas were typically located in central and northern Ethiopia (Figure 1).

Koo et al. (2019) analyzed the impact of the 2015 ENSO event on agriculture and the national economy of Ethiopia and found that Ethiopias GDP fell by 1.6 percent with relatively higher losses experienced in the agricultural sector (agricultural GDP declined by 3.6 percent). Harvested area and crop yield also declined. For instance, the production of te, which accounts for 22 percent of the cultivated area and is grown by 43 percent of all crop farmers (Hassen et al., 2018), fell by 7.3 percent. The 2015/16 drought also had a modest national impact on the animal herd size with specic locations suering disproportionately. The 2015/16 drought was projected to
6
increase national poverty by 1.2 percentage points (Koo et al., 2019), which is equivalent to an additional 656,200 people living below the poverty line. While these macroeconomic impacts provide a summary of the drought on the overall economy, we seek to explain the specic impacts on households disaggregated by access to irrigation.
Adoption of irrigation has been shown to increase food security and improve farm incomes (Ward, 2014). An agro-economic country-wide model to assess irrigation investments in both static and variable climate conditions over a 12-year simulation (2003-2015) by Block et al. (2008), determines that investments in irrigation can reduce the negative eects of drought and enhance production and farm income. Access to reliable irrigation reduces the risk of crop failure, and hence increases farmers incentives to adopt new technologies and intensify cultivation, leading to increased productivity and greater returns from farming (Hussain and Hanjra, 2004).
While there are some research on how irrigation improves household food security in Ethiopia, it is more qualitative and descriptive in nature (Tesfaye et al., 2008; Mengistie and Kidane, 2016; Jambo, Alemu, and Tasew, 2021). As Jambo, Alemu, and Tasew (2021) studied, participation in small-scale irrigation increased daily calorie intake of the small-scale irrigation users by 644 kcal over non-user households. A second study determine that average food consumption expenditure per annual adult equivalent is about 74 percent higher for irrigation households (Tesfaye et al., 2008).
The few research papers looking at the role of small and medium scale irrigation aecting household food security and drought resilience in Ethiopia use small-sample cross sectional data which restricts relative robustness as well as quantitative methodology choices for analysis (Tesfaye et al., 2008; Mengistie and Kidane, 2016; Jambo, Alemu, and Tasew, 2021). For example, Tesfaye et al. (2008) apply Heckmans Two-step Estimation procedure and Jambo, Alemu, and Tasew (2021) use propensity score matching model (PSM) to analyze the impact of small-scale irrigation on household food security at local levels, which precludes some greater generalizability. Given our larger panel sample we can employ: (i) panel data collected from four main regions of the country (ii) employ a quasi-experimental dierence-in-dierences (DID) approach, (iii) which uses data collected before and during the ENSO event, (iv) and we explore more diversied outcome variables such as household dietary diversity score (HDDS), market participation, acreage response to drought, in addition to income and food and non-food expenditure that were done by others.

3 Data and Descriptive statistics
3.1 Data
The paper uses the Ethiopian Agricultural Commercialization Clusters (ACC) survey data collected by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in the four major regions of Ethiopia : Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNP). These four regions account for 86% of the population and more than 95% of the agricultural production in the country (Minot et al., 2021). The country was stratied by region and by ATA Agricultural Commercialization Clusters (ACC). A sample of households were selected from ACCs woredas and outside the ACCs woredas using systematic random sampling. The panel includes data for 2012 and 2016, covering a baseline and the ENSO drought shock period. The 2012 survey covers 3,000 households while the 2016 survey includes 4,991 households. A total of 2,752 households were interviewed in both rounds, and the descriptive and econometric analyses in this study are based on this balanced panel data.
The survey includes modules for household demographics, housing and assets, land ownership and use, crop inputs and labor use, crop production, storage and utilization, livestock ownership, sources of non-farm income, saving and credit, and food and non-food consumption expenditures. A separate module focuses on agricultural land use, including the size of agricultural parcel(s), and management and main water sources for agriculture. If the household uses either ground or surface water as the main source of water for the parcel, then the parcel is dened as irrigated. For our purposes, the household is designated as an irrigating household if it has at least one irrigated parcel.
The paper also uses the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) rainfall data, that provide decadal precipitation data (Funk et al., 2015). Monthly data are linked with sub-kebele4 areas by pixel weights and are then summed to monthly averages. Households are linked into their sub-kebele using GPS coordinates of their homesteads. Z-scores are calculated as the dierence of rainfall during the Meher season (June-September) of 2015 and the long-term 15-year Meher mean (2000-2014), and then divided by the standard deviation of the 15-year values. In this paper a household is dened as drought-aected when the Z-score is less than or equal to

-1. According to McKee et al. (1993) a drought event occurs any time the standard precipitation index (SPI), also referred to as Z-score (Khan, Gabriel, and Rana, 2008), is continuously negative and reaches an intensity of -1.0 or less.
3.2 Descriptive statistics
Table 2 provides the economic and demographic characteristics of households at the baseline year of 2012 based on their exposure status to the 2015 ENSO drought event. We use baseline conditions because dierences between 2012 and 2016 in time-varying variables could be a result of the drought. Households in sub-kebeles that were aected by the 2015 drought have slightly lower household size, are more likely to be female-headed, have somewhat older heads (by about 4.5 years), own less farm land (by about 0.6 hectares), and cultivated less land in 2012 (by about 0.5 hectares), compared to households who live in sub-kebeles that were not aected by the drought (Table 2). In addition, households in sub-kebeles aected by the 2015 drought were already poorer in 2012; they earned less net crop and total income, spend less on food and non-food expenditure, had a lower dietary diversity score, and sold a lower share of their harvest to the market (by 11 percentage points), compared to households in sub-kebeles that were not aected by the drought (Table 2).
The descriptive results in Table 2 suggest that the 2015 drought hit already poor communities,
exacerbating existing socio-economic inequities. However, sub-kebeles aected by the 2015 drought were more likely to use irrigation than sub-kebeles unaected by the drought (by about 4.7 percentage points) (Table 2). Irrigating households tend to perform better using several welfare measures. As shown in Table 3, a summary of economic and demographic characteristics of sampled households by irrigation status at baseline (2012) is depicted. Irrigating households have, on average, more household members, are more likely to be headed by a man, and own a slightly larger number of oxen and slightly greater education of the household head. Age of household head, farmland owned, and amount of land cultivated in the Meher season of 2012 were not statistically signicantly dierent between irrigating and non-irrigating farmers. In terms of economic activity, households that used irrigation in 2012 had more income (both net crop income and total income) and had higher daily food and non-food expenditures than non-irrigators, sold approximately 11 percentage points more of their harvest and had a slightly higher household dietary diversity score. (Table 3).

Table 4 depicts the number of irrigators and non-irrigators by survey rounds. From the 2,752 households sampled in both periods, 211 (7.7%) and 234 (8.5%) used irrigation in 2012 and 2016, respectively. The 2016 survey captures the production activities during the 2015 drought year as the survey is done through recall of the most recent production season. Of the 211 irrigating households in 2012, 104 did not irrigate in 2016. Conversely, 127 households who were not irrigating in 2012, were doing so in 2016. These changes in irrigation status might be linked to the 2015/16
ENSO event.

As discussed in section 2, the value of Z-score less than or equal to -1 is used in this analysis as a cuto point to identify drought aected households. Based on this criterion, among the 2752 households, 1705 (62%) were aected by the 2015 ENSO drought (Table 5). In addition, among the 211 households that used irrigation in 2012, 161 households (76%) were aected by the 2015 ENSO drought (Table 5).

For the most part, sampled irrigating and non-irrigating households are clustered in extremely dry, severely dry, moderately dry, and near normal drought intensities in 2012 (Table 6). Only 36 households belonged to moderately wet or greater rainfall condition in 2015.

3.3 Outcome Variables
The main outcome variables included in this study are net crop income (in real 2012 prices), cultivated area, average daily food expenditure (in real 2012 prices), household dietary diversity score (HDDS), and level of commercialization (measured as the ratio of harvest sold to total
12
harvest). Table 7 depicts descriptive statistics of the outcome variables for non-irrigating households by drought status. As compared to irrigating farmers,non-irrigating households that were aected by the 2015 ENSO drought have faced lower net crop income (by 6,397 Ethiopian Birr), cultivated less land (by 0.52 hectares), reduced their daily food expenditure by 3.6 Birr, faced a reduced household dietary diversity score (by 0.7), and sold less of their output (by 16 percentage points).

Table 8 shows how the 2015 drought aected irrigating households. Among irrigating households, the drought led to a reduction in cultivated area (by 0.57 hectares), in the household dietary diversity score (by 0.54), and in the share of harvest sold (by 14 percentage points) (Table 8). Importantly, net crop income and daily food expenditures were not signicantly dierent between households that were aected and those that were not aected by the drought.

The descriptive results so far have indicated that the 2015 ENSO drought disproportionately aected areas that were already less productive, and adversely aected the welfare of both irrigating and non-irrigating households, albeit to a dierent extent. However, baseline dierences derived from the descriptive statics between areas aected and not aected by the drought and between those households with and without irrigation makes it dicult to distinguish the impact of the drought from general trends of the outcome variables and whether the drought had heterogeneous impacts by irrigation status. In the sections that follow, we will approach the question using econometric methods that allows us to establish causal linkages between the 2015 drought and the outcomes of interest in a manner that allows for baseline dierences and common trends.
4 Empirical Model
The econometric approach exploits the exogenous ENSO drought shock of 2015 that hit large parts of central and northern Ethiopia. The data collected from the same households in 2012 (before the drought) and in 2016 (after the drought) allows us to employ a quasi-experimental dierence-in-dierences (DID) approach to analyze the impact of the 2015 drought on several household welfare measures. The household welfare measures include, amount of land brought into cultivation, real net crop income (in 2012 real prices), real total daily food expenditure (in 2012 real prices), share of harvest sold, and household dietary diversity score.
Equally as important as understanding the impact of the 2015 ENSO event on the selected welfare measures, is the role access to irrigation plays to withstand the adverse eects of the drought. Irrigation is expected to provide several opportunities for farmers to cope with the drought sh","9918"

1 Introduction
Environmental concerns are reaching worrying levels globally. Global warming has led to a temperature increase of 1.0C compared to pre-industrial levels, and it is expected that this continues further, reaching 1.5C by 2050 (IPCC, 2019). Deforestation is skyrocketing and according to the World Wildlife Fund (2021), 43 million hectares were deforested globally between 2004 and 2017, which is equivalent to 10% of the world's forests. Among the various causes associated with these phenomena, food supply chains stand out, which generate about 30% of the anthropogenic greenhouse

gas (GHG?) emissions both as direct emissions from production and through the conversion of natural ecosystems to pasture and crop land (Benton et al., 2021). In particular, the cattle sector is exposed as a major responsible for the environmental crisis, since it has direct effects on the loss of biodiversity (Alkemade et al., 2012), GHG emissions (Grossi et al., 2019), destruction of ecosystems (Fuentes et al., 2019), and contamination of natural resources such as water (Cesonien et. al, 2019) and soil (Mora et al., 2017).
This environmental problem, as well as its relationship with the cattle sector, was addressed in 2015 in the Paris Agreement through which countries committed to adopt internal mitigation measures to reduce GHG emissions and thus contribute to climate change mitigation through the compliance with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) (United Nations, 2015a). In the same year, the United Nations General Assembly established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), 17 principles whose purpose is to achieve a more sustainable planet by 2030, and which directly link the cattle sector, namely to No Poverty (SDG-2), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG-8), Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG-9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG-11), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG-12), and Life on Land (SDG-15), and indirectly to most other SDGs (United Nations, 2015b). The commitments made in these agreements, in addition to the economic, social, political, and environmental contexts of each country, have led national governments to carry out actions in search of sustainability. Colombia was selected as.country of analysis since its environmental indicators have reached preoccupying levels at the regional level: . According to the National GHG Inventory 1990-2012 (Inventario Nacional de Gases de Efecto Invernadero 1990-2012, the most rigorous study available), in 2012, the country emitted 258,8 Mton of GHG (IDEAM, 2016), and is now ranking third in South America, after Brazil and Argentina, in terms of GHG emissions (Crippa et al, 2023). Likewise, between 2018 and 2020; 527,738 ha of natural forest were felled, with extensive cattle farming and grassland establishment being among the major direct causes (IDEAM, 2021), making Colombia the country with the fourth highest deforestation rate globally over the last 30 years (5.8 million ha) (CEPAL, 2021). The focus of this research was thus put on Colombia since for Brazil and Argentina, the primary beef exporters in the region, a wealth of literature already exists, whereas Colombia presents a less explored scenario.
To understand how national governments have responded to this situation, it is necessary to explore their public policies. With the aim of delimiting this study, the Colombian Policy for Sustainable Cattle 2022-2050 (Politica para.la Ganaderia Bovina Sostenible 2022-2050; Resolution 126 of 2022) (MADR and MADS;.2022) was selected for analysis since it is the first national policy on sustainable cattle in Colombia, and thus marks a turning point in the pursuit of sustainability within the Colombian livestock sector. Additionally, since the policy will stretch between 2022 and 2060, it will set the course for regional public policies in the coming three decades. . According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MADS), the policy aims at achieving a transformation of the cattle sector through socio-economic development and environmental responsibility, thus contributing to carbon neutrality of the country

(MADR and MADS, 2022). The policy applies to all cattle activities, including beef cattle, dairy cattle, and dual-purpose cattle, and is to be implemented by public entities at the national and local levels. To this extent, the objective of this study is to analyze the construction process of the policy and to determine the environmental, social, economic, and political factors that allowed the change of direction in the Colombian public policies towards more sustainability of the cattle sector. This will allow for the identification of successes and failures, barriers to overcome, and required changes, and thus support the actors in the implementation of the policy, assuring that the set policy objectives can be met and the transition of the sector towards more sustainability will actually take place.
With this objective, the Kaleidoscope Model of Policy Change (KMPC) was used as theoretical framework, inductively derived from empirical situations in developing countries (Resnick et al., 2018). The KMPC provides a structured method for understanding the development and implementation processes of public policies, as well as how to evaluate and reform them. It helps in analyzing how transformations in public policies occur, whether in a specific place, context, or period. It proposes five stages of analysis, namely a) Agenda Setting, b) Design, c) Adoption, d) Implementation, and e) Evaluation & Reform (Haggblade and Resnick, 2018). Since the Colombian Policy for Sustainable Cattle 2022-2050 has not yet been implemented, the analysis is limited to the first three stages. The research corresponds to a review article,and follows a qualitative-descriptive approach based on primary and secondary data. The study adds value to both the scientific debate and practical policy making for sustainability, since the environmental situation, both globally and nationally, requires the interest of academy to understand how policies in search of sustainability are being developed. Consequently, the article serves as an input a) for public policy makers in general, and b) the various actors that will be involved inthe Implementation and Evaluation & Reform stages of the policy of analysis.
The study is divided into the following sections: Section 2 provides the theoretical framework. It presents a conceptualization of public policies and introduces the KMPC. Section 3 provides the methodology used for this study. In the results and analysis Section 4, we describe the implications of an unsustainable cattle sector, the regional progress that led to a national-level strategy, the institutional efforts involved in policy consolidation, as well as the benefits of this policy according to the pillars of sustainability, and the initial challenges in the implementation process. . Section 5 provides recommendations and Section 6 conclusions.
2 Theoretical Framework
For the development of this study, it was necessary to consider some conceptual principles regarding public policies, while also addressing the most relevant theoretical model according to the subject of study. Birkland (2016) points out that policies are a statement of what governments intend to do or not do, and that they can be expressed in laws, resolutions, regulations, or a combination of these. Likewise, they state that it is possible to identify some particularities, such as being designed by public institutions, responding to a specific problem or social need, and defining the means to solve said problem. In the same sense, Howlett and Cashore (2014) suggest that although public policies may be developed with the influence of non-governmental actors (e.g., private entities, lobbyists, social movements), governments oversee and control them due to their role as decision makers on behalf of the citizens.
Regarding the theoretical model, two options for public policy analysis were considered: the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) and the KMPC. The ACF states that policies are the result of collaborative and competitive relationships between stakeholder coalitions (Satoh et al., 2021). The framework

provides four premises, namely a) the necessity to consider a decade or more to understand the change in policies; b) the unit of analysis is not any state institution in particular but rather the subsystem, understood as a set of public and private organizations involved in a problem; c) considers a diversity of actors outside a government, such as researchers and the media; and d) policies are interpreted as a way of imposing the belief system of cause coalitions (Gmez Lee, 2012). On the other hand, Haggblade and Resnick (2018) state that the KMPC has three essential principles, namely it a) takes public policy into account in all its complexity, from setting the agenda to evaluation; b) incorporates a diversity of stakeholders, such as the donor community and research centers; and c) is intended to be applicable to a diversity of political, social, economic, and demographic contexts. All of the above, with the purpose of understanding the reasons and the way in which public policies are transformed in a certain place, context, or period. As described below, the KMPC comprises five stages and 16 variables (Figure 1):
Stage 1  Agenda setting: Explains why certain issues and not others generate interest in governments. It includes three variables: 1) Recognized, relevant problem: Indicates the size and urgency of the problem. 2) Focusing events: Specific events that accentuate the importance of certain issues, such as an economic crisis, a natural disaster, or an international summit. 3) Powerful advocates: Actors in charge of driving the action. They can be government or civil actors,.the private sector, donor agencies, investors, or the research community, among others.
Stage 2  Design: Refers to the moment where possible solutions to the problem are proposed. It includes three variables: 1) Knowledge & Research:. The research community can present previous success stories or suggest characteristics of the public policy that allow solving the problem. 2) Norms, biases, ideology & beliefs: Explain the causes and possible solutions of the problem, for which they determine the approach of the public policy that each actor seeks. 3) Cost-benefit calculations: Reflect the struggle between the actors and how some alternatives prevail over others in search of certain benefits.
Stage 3  Adoption: The design of a policy does not mean that it will be adopted. For adoption, three variables must be considered: 1) Powerful opponents vs. proponents: For the policy to be implemented, proponents must be stronger than opponents. 2) Government veto players: Government actors need to be supportive or neutral regarding a public policy, otherwise, it can be vetoed. 3) Propitious timing: Social, economic, political, and other situations that the actors use to promote policy change.
Stage 4  Implementation: Refers to the stage where government institutions generate administrative changes and delivery of resources to meet the objective of the policy. It includes four variables: 1) Requisite budget: The government or donors allocate the necessary financial resources. 2) Institutional capacity: Human resources, infrastructure, and coordination, follow-up, and control capacity on the part of the institutions. 3) Implementation veto players: Attempts to stymie a policy can be made, even at a late stage. 4) Commitment of policy champions: Critical to counter resource, capacity, and other challenges.
Stage 5  Evaluation & Reform: Examines whether the objectives of the public policy were met or whether it is necessary to reformulate it, either partially or completely. It includes three variables: 1) Changing information and beliefs: New knowledge emerges that determines whether a public policy should be reformulated. 2) Changing material conditions: Changes in human, natural, or market factors, among others, which may have changed since the policy was designed. 3) Institutional shifts: They can occur due to the presence of new actors, for example, the arrival of a new government.

It should be noted that although both theoretical models are complex and allow to approach and understand public policies and policy change in all their dimensions, the present study was developed consulting the KMPC since it comprises a perspective that emphasizes on the characteristics of the policy. This contrasts with the ACF which includes a greater diversity of actors and variables of the political system, which may be too broad for the context of this study. Similarly, it stands out that the KMPC has been widely used in the analysis of public policies for the agricultural sector. Among these are studies on the micronutrient policy processes in South Africa (Hendriks et al., 2016), the drivers of fertilizer subsidy programs in Tanzania (Mather and Ndyetabula, 2016), and nutrition policies in Africa (Hendriks et al., 2017). The model has also been applied for the analysis of the food security policy in Zambia, where the practical contributions of the model became obvious, such as the importance of complementarity between disciplines, linking political economy and political science, and the ability to provide information to donors on when and where investments are most feasible according to the political, economic, and institutional context of the country (Resnick et al., 2018).

3 Material and Methods
Journal Pre-proof
The present study is a review article(Palmatier et al., 2018), which carries out a critical and systematic analysis of documentary materials related to the Colombian Policy for Sustainable Cattle 2022-2050 (Politica para la Ganaderia Bovina Sostenible 2022-2050; Resolution 126 of 2022). The review was carried out applying a qualitative-descriptive approach, for which, following Lune and Berg (2017), concepts, characteristics, and descriptions were prioritized, without excluding the importance of quantitative data, such as environmental indicators, budgets, and others. The research was developed following nine stages: a) idea; b) problem statement; c) field immersion; d) definition of the type of study; e) definition of information sources; f) data collection; g) data analysis; h) interpretation of results; i) preparation of the final report (Hrnandez Sampieri et al., 2014). The analysis is structured in five sections that consider the applied theoretical framework related to the KMPC and its five stages of policy change. This article focuses particularly on the first three stages of the KMPC, namely Agenda setting, Design, and Adoption. In addition, some already observable challenges with the Implementation stage are being addressed, even though it has not started yet. The final stage of Evaluation & Reform could not be addressed given that the public policy is not yet implemented.
Primary and secondary sources were used in data collection (Sahu, 2013). Primary data was obtained through key informant interviews (KII) with a semi-structured interview guideline (Table A.1). This approach was chosen considering some of its advantages, such.as.obtaining spontaneous statements and identifying aspects to be deepened (Adams, 2015). In this context, several stages were followed: First, the institutions involved in the development of the policy were identified and then contacted by email with an interview request for one of their representatives. Second, the stakeholders were provided with information about the purpose of the study and the voluntary nature of their participation. Third, at the time of the interview, the participants were asked for their verbal consent to record the conversation and use the anonymized data for analysis and publication. The interviews were conducted through Microsoft Teams and lasted approximately 20 minutes each. A total of 13 KII with representatives from the public (MADR: 1) and private (Angus Azul: 1; Fedegan: 1) sectors, NGOs (Solidaridad: 3; The Nature Conservancy:.1; GGGI: 1), research (CIAT: 3; CIPAV: 1), and multi- actor platforms (Tropical Forest Alliance: 1) were conducted between October 2022 and January 2023. It should be noted that these individuals participated directly and indirectly in the policy as representatives of their organizations in various forums held during the design stage. All sources were anonymized through aliases and cited in this article by using the expression Interview # and the corresponding number (Table A.2). Content analysis was applied to group and analyze similar opinions and statements. Regarding secondary data, three types of sources were consulted: a) Documents from official sources (MADR; MADS, DNP, IDEAM, Congreso de la Reptiblica de Colombia), with the objective of understanding both previous public policies and the characteristics of the national policy in question (actors, objectives, resources, etc.); b) Publications by international organizations (e.g., CEPAL, FAO, IPCC, CIPAV, CIAT, United Nations) that allow contrasting environmental indicators, figures, and other valuable information; and c) Scientific literature to carry out the analysis and discussion of the results, particularly in aspects related to sustainability or experiences of sustainable cattle farming in other contexts. The search for the three types of sources was conducted with Google Scholar, using keyword combinations such as public policy, law, sustainable cattle farming, GHG emissions, and deforestation. The results were limited to the last ten years (2012-2022).
Finally, three limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, the implementation phase of the policy has not yet started making it impossible to obtain a complete picture and compare the objectives of the policy with the obtained results. To this extent, the analysis is limited to addressing the stages prior to implementation and the objectives, axes, and other theoretical aspects. Second, although an attempt was made to contact all the institutions involved in the development of the policy to obtain insights into their official positions, no response was obtained from some of them. This made it
7
Journal Pre-proof
necessary to communicate with other actors who knew about the policy development process and the role of the involved institutions. Third, the use of primary data involves some degree of subjectivity on the part of the stakeholders in the interpretation of the facts, due to which each statement was included with a quote (although anonymously), differentiating the positions of the interviewees from those made by the authors in the analysis.
4 Results, analysis, and discussion
This section provides the results, analysis, and discussion of the review of the Colombian Policy for Sustainable Cattle 2022-2050 according to the framework provided by the KMPC. A summary of the main elements of the policy as defined by the KMPC can be found in Table 1.
4.1 Relevant problem: Unsustainable traditional cattle farming in Colombia
According to the KMPC, for issues to be considered for policy making by public institutions, they must correspond to a relevant problem, in addition to being linked to a focusing event that accentuates their importance (Resnick et al., 2018). Consequently, to understand-how traditional cattle farming has become a relevant problem in Colombia, it is necessary to consider environmental, economic, and social aspects, as well as the Paris Agreement and the establishment of the SDGs in 2015.
Extensive cattle ranching and the associated extension of grasslands are among the main causes of the deforestation phenomenon in Colombia, which has reached 197,159 ha in 2018, 158,894 ha in 2019, and 171,685 ha in 2020 (IDEAM, 2021). Likewise, the cattle sector contributed with 26% of the 258.8 Mton of GHG emissions generated in Colombia in 2012, particularly due to enteric fermentation (IDEAM, 2016). Furthermore, the effects of traditional extensive cattle farming on biodiversity are becoming evident, affecting species such as aquatic macroinvertebrates (Meza et al., 2020), birds (Vergara et al., 2017), insects, and others. Such national indicators exacerbate the global problem of climate change, which by itself has a negative impact on cattle production, i.e., through additional heat stress in cattle (Thornton et al., 2021) and diseases (Betta et al., 2017), and on cattle feed supply chains (Mason et al., 2021), thus fostering a two-way relationship between the cattle sector and climate change.
Regarding economic factors, two situations can be highlighted. First, the environmental demands of consumers regarding how meat is produced and its impacts in terms of GHG emissions, deforestation, and other factors related to sustainability have made it difficult for Colombia to open new markets, particularly in the United States, Asia, and Europe, where higher prices can be obtained (Moreno Lerma et al., 2021). For the latter, the free trade agreement with the European Union states that all products that enter must be developed based on sustainability criteria (Interview #3). Second, a context where there is no progress in sustainable cattle practices hinders Payment for Ecosystem Service programs and, therefore, endangers the economic resources that are fundamental in reducing poverty for smallholder and medium-sized cattle producers (Diaz et al., 2019). This is essential considering that the cattle sector generates approximately 810,000 direct jobs, which represent 6% of the national employment (Fedegan, 2018). Therefore, the inaccessible high-value markets and the limited incentives to invest in the cattle sector in Colombia have become a focus of attention for public institutions in charge of ensuring the economic growth of the country.
When it comes to focus events, the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 must be mentioned, which led to the commitment of implementing actions for reducing GHG emissions and by this contributing to climate change mitigation through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) (United Nations, 2015a). This adheres to the implementation of the SDGs, a set of 17 principles that aim to achieve a
8
Journal Pre-proof
more sustainable planet by 2030, which are directly and indirectly related to the cattle sector, especially in the end goals No Poverty (SDG-2), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG-8), Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG-9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG-11), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG-12), and Life on Land (SDG-15) (United Nations, 2015b). As Lozano (2020) points out, Colombia has historically participated in both agreements as well as various others promoted by the international community to reduce pollution levels and promote sustainable production in different economic sectors. Colombia responded quickly to the commitments made and incorporated the SDGs into the 2014-2018 National Development Plan as well as into the different 2016-2019 Territorial Development Plans (Lozano, 2020). This disposition of the National Government was reaffirmed in the national Decree 280 of 2015, which created the High Level Inter- institutional Commission (Comision Interinstitucional de Alto Nivel) with the aim of applying the SDGs through public policies, programs, and other actions, while also carrying out monitoring and evaluation of the progress made with achieving them (Presidencia de la Reptiblica de Colombia, 2015). However, from a critical position, Bustos (2018) states that in the design of policies, foreign opinions and the desire of governments to be prominent actors in the international community may have been more relevant than the national public opinion. In this sense, environmental rhetoric and mitigation commitments must also be understood from the need for prestige and the search for benefits from international cooperation. Beyond these interpretations, this discussion highlights the importance of a focus event, as shown by other studies that have applied the KMPC. In South Africa, for example, the 1990 World Summit for Children and the end of Apartheid promoted the micronutrient policy, previously not considered as a priority in its application for black communities (Hendriks et al., 2016). Likewise, the same summit made food deficiencies in Zambia visible, promoting an increase in resources from donors to finance the food security policy (Resnick et al., 2018).
To this extent, the configuration of the public policy agenda arises from the confluence of two equally important factors. Although it is true that the environmental crisis and its social and economic effects were exposed as a relevant problem that required a state response (recognized, relevant problem), which was partially being developed. through public policies and legislative advances (as will be explained in the following section), already, the commitments acquired with the international community in Paris 2015 - regardless of the political interests of the government - highlighted the problem and the need to prioritize it on the public agenda (focusing events). Consequently, both internal and external demands (powerful advocates) evidenced the impossibility of continuing with traditional extensive cattle farming, encouraging the Colombian government to set the agenda for the development of the Colombian Policy for Sustainable Cattle 2022-2050 (Stage 1 - Agenda setting).

Groundwater development is key to accelerating agricultural growth and to achieving food security in a climate crisis. However, the rapid increase in groundwater exploitation over the past four decades has resulted in depletion and degradation, particularly in regions already facing acute water scarcity, with potential irreversible impacts for food security and economic prosperity. Using a climatewaterfood systems modelling framework, we develop exploratory scenarios and find that halting groundwater depletion without complementary policy actions would adversely affect food production and trade, increase food prices and grow the number of people at risk of hunger by 26 million by 2050. Supportive policy interventions in food and water systems such as increasing the effective use of precipitation and investments in agricultural research and development could mitigate most negative effects of sustainable groundwater use on food security. In addition, changing preferences of high-income countries towards less-meat-based diets would marginally alleviate pressures on food price. To safeguard the ability of groundwater systems to realize water and food security objectives amidst climate challenges, comprehensive measures encompassing improved water management practices, advancements in seed technologies and
appropriate institutions will be needed.
Water and food security are intrinsically linked as irrigated agriculture contributes around 40% of global food production on 20% of culti- vated land1. At the same time, water use in agriculture accounts for around 70% of global freshwater withdrawals, of which 40% is used for animal feed production2. An estimated 42% of irrigation water is sourced from groundwater (GW)3, and China, India, Iran, Pakistan and the USA are the globally largest GW users in terms of volume. Devel- opment of GW for irrigation offers many advantages, including prox- imity to users, lower investment requirements4, individual control, higher water productivity, often better water quality compared with surface sources and lower seasonal variation in availability5. Moreover, GW development is accelerating in sub-Saharan Africa as a result of
cheaper technologies, including the increased availability of afford- able solar-powered pumps6,7.
Extensive GW use has benefited global economic development and has improved food security and livelihoods8. However, substantial expansion of GW development has also caused severe water depletion, reduced freshwater access and subsurface flows, led to cross-border tensions and increased inequity between those who can access the resource and those who cannot911. Depletion of GW has also contrib- uted to sea-level rise and has even changed the tilt of the Earths axis12. Sustained GW overdraft also lowers aquifers hydraulic head, raising pumping costs13, causing land subsidence and saltwater intrusion14,15, threatening irrigated agriculture16 and contributing to greenhouse gas

emissions17,18. Solar-driven irrigation pumps reduce emissions but are considered to encourage more rapid GW depletion19,20. Several studies suggest that unsustainable GW use will eventually jeopardize water and food security and rural livelihoods when wells dry up or when it becomes uneconomical to irrigate crops21,22, leading to abandonment of GW-fed farms23.
As climate change renders rainfed agriculture less viable and dis- rupts surface water (SW) availability for irrigation, GW is increasingly being favoured as the primary source of irrigation for agriculture24. Moreover, climate change also directly affects the quantity and quality of GW recharge through changes in precipitation, temperature and sea-level rise25 and indirectly affects water use26. As such, GW resources are affected by climate change through both increased extraction levels for irrigation and other uses and lower recharge. Recent assessments conducted to quantify the extent of GW depletion at regional to global scales27,28 demonstrate the large-scale changes in GW storages across hotspot regions of the world. Our analysis of changes in GW recharge due to climate change further highlights these issues (Supplementary Fig. 1). Even in areas where recharge is expected to increase with climate change, such as in northwestern India29, the increase is unlikely to com- pensate for anthropogenic extraction in the short to medium term30.
The paper contributes to the emerging literature on the worlds growing dependence on poorly managed GW resources for water and food security. The specific contributions of this paper are the assessment of the impacts of eliminating unsustainable GW use on various indicators of food security and the analysis of a series of policy investments to counteract negative food security impacts from more sustainable GW management. The study thus identifies ways to reduce trade-offs between the achievements of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 on zero hunger and those of SDG 6 on water and sanitation. The highly complex nature of hydrogeological systems does not allow us to explicitly draw conclusions for specific aquifers, and data uncertainty currently does not allow assessment on food prices from individual aquifers becoming unusable.
To analyse the global climatewaterfood trade-offs, we use IMPACT, a suite of integrated biophysicaleconomic assessment models developed and maintained at the International Food Policy Research Institute33. The core components of the model used for our analysis are the IMPACT Global Hydrology Model (IGHM), the IMPACT Multi-market Food Model and the IMPACT Water Simulation Model (IWSM) (Methods).
Increasing GW depletion has been recognized as a major challenge to global food security, particularly with growing demands for food: with a projected population of to 9.7 billion people by 205030, global food demand is expected to increase by 3556% between 2010 and 2050 across various food projections models31, while an estimated additional 5170 million people will be at risk of hunger31,32.
Using the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) waterfood modelling framework, we estimate that the demand for food crops will increase by 40% between 2020 and 2050, with the largest absolute demand increase for fruits and vegetables and oilseed crops (Table 1). The corresponding increase in irrigation water demand is 17%. While this is much lower than projected increases in water use in the industrial and domestic sectors, in absolute terms, the projected increase is largest for the irrigation sector, with an estimated increase of 201 billion cubic metres (bcm) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
We first estimate the effects on food security from eliminating GW overdraft under climate change by 2050. Climate change affects GW recharge levels34 through both changes in precipitation, temperatures and extreme events and changes in the demand for GW as SW flows decline or become less reliable. We then analyse a series of agricultural, water and nutrition policy levers that can reduce or offset the adverse food security impacts from more sustainable GW management. These include public investments in agricultural research and development (R&D); more effective use of precipitation (green water) through mulch- ing, terracing, conservation agriculture and other means (ERM); and reduced meat consumption in high-income countries (HICs) (RMC). Details of scenario assumptions and settings are presented in Methods.
Results
Regional and country-scale variation of GW depletion, collectively, GW withdrawals, tripled from 227 bcm in 1990 to 879 bcm in 2020, equivalent to a 4.6% annual rate of growth. By contrast, SW withdrawals

Fig. 1 | Changes in rates of GW withdrawals between No GWC and GWC across regions, projected to 2050. No GWC is the baseline without GW conservation, while GWC ensures that GW withdrawals are equal to net recharge rates. Both are
doubled from 963 bcm in 1990 to 2,697 bcm in 202030,34, reflecting growing pressures on GW resources as demands on water resources continue to increase. However, when sustainable GW withdrawals are defined as those that do not exceed net recharge, 25% of river basins are characterized as overexploited; that is, GW is withdrawn beyond net recharge rates in those basins (Supplementary Table 1). These same basins account for 61% of total GW withdrawals, suggesting that GW mining remains a phenomenon limited to certain regions in the world, and particularly to South and East Asia, West Asia and the USA. The top overdraft basins are found in India, Pakistan, China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the USA and Egypt, each with more than 10 bcm of annual depletion and a group total depletion volume of 279 bcm, representing 83% of global GW depletion (Supplementary Table 2). In basins with depletion, GW overdraft is higher in LMICs, at 195%, compared with HICs, at 131%. Severe GW depletion in India has been shown to reduce the potential of rural income generation and has been linked to outmigration and an overall decline in the potential for adaptation to climate change35,36, while areas with more secure and stable water resources were less likely to rely on migration and had scope to withstand climate change impacts. At the same time, there is potential for additional sustainable GW withdrawals in many of the not yet overexploited aquifers.

Figure 1 presents changes in GW withdrawals between the no GW conservation (No GWC) scenario and the GWC scenario. Under the GWC scenario, by 2027 withdrawals are reduced by 342 bcm. Most of the reduction takes place in the group of LMICs (297 bcm), while the reduc- tion in HICs is 45 bcm. Elimination of overdraft particularly affects India, whose GW pumping is reduced by 164 bcm (to 39%), China, by 34 bcm (to 69%), and the USA, by 12 bcm (to 76%) compared with the No GWC or baseline values for 2027. Furthermore, we assess the consequences of arresting GW withdrawals on agricultural production and prices.
GW depletion impact on food prices and food security
Halting GW depletion reduces agricultural production, increases food prices and results in a larger number of people at risk of hunger. As rice and wheat globally account for the largest applications of irrigation water, and most irrigated wheat is grown in Asia, production declines are largest for these two crops, at 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively. This is followed by declines in production of maize (1.0%) and sugarcane (0.6%). Across all agricultural commodities, production declines by 0.73%, and across all animal and plant-based foods, it declines by 0.66%. In terms of most affected regions, wheat, rice and maize production decline most in LMICs while HICs make up for some of the produc- tion shortfalls of wheat and sugarcane in response to higher prices for

these commodities (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In terms of country-level impacts, in India wheat and sugar production are affected most, while in China rice production drops most sharply. Neither country can make up for these declines through increased production of other crops or elsewhere in their countries (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Changes in GW access also affect global trade regimes, with net trade in rice increasing globally by 10.8% and trade in sugar by 3.5% to compensate for production shortfalls. At the same time, global net trade in wheat is projected to contract by 3.3% because of reduced exports from the South Asia region (Supplementary Table 3). Given thin agricultural commodity markets, limited stocks and the time it takes for production systems to adjust, small declines in global food production can lead to large changes in global food prices. We observe this in the case of rice and wheat, where prices increase by 7.4% and 6.7%, respectively, and on average, prices for all cereals increase by 5.2%.
Higher food prices impact the poor the most, as their share of household expenditures on food is higher. Lower food production and associated higher food prices because of GWC make food less afford- able to poorer populations, with subsequent increases in the severity of undernourishment, disproportionately affecting LMICs (Fig. 2). This translates to approximately 24 million more undernourished people in LMICs, including 5.2 million more undernourished people in China and 2.6 million more undernourished people in India. The global increase in the number of people at risk of hunger would be around 26 million higher with GWC, above the 520.6 million people at risk of hunger in the No GWC baseline. With GWC, by 2050, the share of the population at risk of hunger would be 14% higher in India, 7% higher in the USA and 6% higher in China.
insecurity impacts from GWC. The first scenario focuses on investment
in agricultural R&D to increase yields of water-constrained irrigated crops through better seed technologies and associated agronomic practices. These include improvements in water use efficiency that can be achieved through improving transpiration efficiency of crops, by reducing the share of the harvested share in total biomass of crops through dwarf and semi-dwarf varieties and by reducing crop failure under climate extreme events in irrigated environments through drought-, heat-stress- and submergent-tolerant varieties, among oth- ers. These investments directly reduce the reliance on GW sources for agricultural production. The second scenario aims to reduce food security impacts from reduced GW pumping through improving the management of precipitation (ERM) through interventions such as conservation agriculture, mulching and terracing on both irrigated and rainfed areas. The third scenario reduces the propensity to con- sume meat products (RMC) in HICs through changing the elasticity of demand for these foods in these geographies. Reducing the consump- tion of meats reduces the demand for GW-fed animal feeds, such as maize. However, the resulting lower prices for meat products would also increase their affordability by poorer populations that currently can- not afford a healthy diet. The increased affordability of meat products from lower consumption levels in HICs might thus reduce or negate the benefits from reduced meat consumption in HICs. A fourth and final scenario combines the R&D and ERM scenarios to take advantage of their synergies, combining higher irrigated yields with more effec- tive use of precipitation on agricultural lands (scenario details are presented in Supplementary Table 7). All these policy scenarios are simulated together with the GWC scenario and hereafter referred to with a + prefix.
Investments in foodwater policies and their impacts
We implement three alternative policy scenarios to assess the potential of investments in food and water systems in reducing the adverse food
All policy scenarios, except for the RMC scenario, result in an increase in average crop production levels and significant reductions in food prices (Fig. 3) compared with the GWC scenario, which is depicted

for comparison. The alternative policy scenarios were calculated as least cost (Methods and Supplementary Information), and results are presented as changes over the No GWC baseline. The scenarios effec- tiveness in mitigating adverse food security effects of GWC increases as values approach zero.
By accelerating investments in irrigated crop yields (+R&D) by 4.5% over baseline investments (No GWC), wheat prices are only 3.0% instead of 6.7% higher with GWC, and on average, cereal prices are 1.2% higher and sugar prices are 0.8% higher. Prices for several other crops are slightly below the levels of the No GWC baseline. Results are somewhat similar for the +ERM scenario, where the least-cost approach calculated needed improvements of 4.5% over the projection horizon.
Under the +ERM scenario, rice prices are higher compared with the +R&D scenario as rice is mostly irrigated and benefits somewhat less from improved precipitation management. However, maize prices decline to levels below those of the +R&D scenario as maize is largely rainfed and more strongly benefits from better management of pre- cipitation. In the +ERM scenario, cereal prices are 1.9% above those of the baseline.
The combined +R&D and +ERM scenario, which includes a 2% increase in irrigated yields and a 3% improvement in effective rain- fall management, results in lower maize prices compared with the
+R&D scenario and in lower rice and wheat prices compared with the +ERM scenario but cannot lower cereal prices to below the levels of the +R&D scenario. However, prices for sugar and oilseed crops are further reduced.
The +RMC scenario also lowers food prices compared with the GWC scenario, but price declines are very small, except for meat prices, which are 1.1% below baseline levels. Furthermore, prices of maize, the major irrigated livestock feed, are projected to be 2.5% higher than the baseline, which is a considerable but not major decline compared with maize prices under the GWC scenario.
Figure 4 presents the increase in the population at risk of hunger under the alternative policy scenarios compared with the No GWC baseline and compared with the results under the GWC scenario. Com- pared with the global increase in the population at risk of hunger of 5% under the GWC scenario, the increases are 0.9% under the +R&D scenario (Fig. 4a), 1.9% under the +ERM scenario (Fig. 4b) and 1.1% under the combined +R&D and +ERM scenario (Fig. 4c). The +R&D scenario is particularly beneficial for India and China, which are large GW irrigators and therefore particularly benefit from increased invest- ments in seed technologies focused on improving water use efficiency. These investments help to retain food production levels in GW-fed Asian breadbasket regions, keeping food prices and the number of

people at risk of hunger down. Benefits from investments in effective management of precipitation, however, are spread more broadly. While their ability to maintain production levels in China and India is comparatively limited, they still succeed in substantially reducing the risk of hunger. Under the +RMC scenario, however, the share of people at risk of hunger increases by 4.8%, which remains close to the 5.0% increase in the GWC scenario. Here the risk of hunger increases in the group of HICs by 15.9%, or 7.4 million people, compared with the No GWC baseline, while the increase in the risk of hunger in the group of LMICs is reduced to 3.7%, or 17.6 million people, compared with the GWC scenario increase of 5.0%. Despite a notable rise in the risk of hunger compared with the baseline, meat consumption experiences a marginal improvement of 2.1% in LMICs due to increased affordabil- ity. By contrast, HICs witness an 8.7% decline in consumption, while global consumption decreases by 0.96% compared with the baseline without GWC.
Discussion
Development of GW has played a major role in food production growth and food security over the past several decades, particularly in the breadbasket areas of China and India but also in parts of the Middle East, North Africa and the USA. However, food production growth comes at the cost of GW depletion, which is further accelerating with climate change, with threats to loss of productive lands and sometimes irreversible damages to water-based ecosystems. Accel- erated GW development is further fuelled by energy subsidies and the swift deployment of solar-powered irrigation pumps. While the depletion of GW remains confined to specific breadbasket basins, the development of GW resources is gaining momentum in numer- ous regions worldwide, and the associated depletion is projected to increase in parallel, putting increasing shares of our water and food security at risk.

We find that measures aimed at arresting GW depletion without complementary policy actions would adversely affect food production, resulting in upward pressures on food prices, particularly for cereals and fruits and vegetables. As such, the study has re-affirmed the strong inter-connections between achieving SDG 2 on zero hunger and SDG 6 on water and sanitation. However, there is a host of complementary policy options that can help reduce the adverse impacts of more sus- tainable GW management. We analyse four of these in detail and find that accelerated investments in the productivity of irrigated crops, more effective use of precipitation, a combination of these two inter- ventions and, to a lesser extent, reducing meat consumption in HICs can reduce global food price impacts of GW conservation. While changes in prices are only modest at the global level, effects on regions with high levels of GW depletion are significant. Our findings in this regard closely parallel another study that observed detrimental effects on food production when reducing GW depletion37, which reports nega- tive effects on food production from reducing GW depletion. Those authors, however, did not include the environmental flow contribution from aquifers and did not assess complementary investment policies to address food security impacts of halting GW depletion.
Our analyses have shown that it is important to use a transdiscipli- nary approach to identify solutions to environmental problems. While directly focusing on increasing water use efficiency of irrigated crops depending on depleting GW is important, improving the effective use of precipitation offers a potential policy alternative even though crops and geographies that are less dependent on GW irrigation might benefit more. Investments in better management of more variable levels of precipitation will become more important as water scarcity continues to grow, and our scenario on efficient rainfed management (GWC + ERM) offers a potential policy alternative to mitigate the negative impacts of the GW conservation scenario. A shift towards more rainfed cultiva- tion to meet global food supply by 2100 has already been suggested38.

However, despite localized successes39 and growing use of minimum tillage and other conservation agricultural practices, broader farmer acceptance of water harvesting techniques has been mixed due to the high costs of implementation40. Similarly, many studies have already suggested multiple health and climate change mitigation benefits from reducing meat consumption in HICs; reducing pressure on depleting GW stocks would be a further, albeit small, bonus of such a policy as it has shown to be less effective compared with the +R&D and +ERM scenarios.
While food security impacts of halting GW depletion can probably be managed through the multi-pronged approach proposed here, the question remains whether GW depletion can even be halted. Much has been done to address growing GW depletion, albeit with limited impacts on aquifer recovery. This includes improved measurement and monitoring devices, including satellite telemetry for monitoring wells as well as through increased citizen science. While GW institutions are lacking or poorly enforced in much of the world, legislation and institu- tions are starting to be developed to address some of the more extreme water-table declines. An example is the recent Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of California41. Recent innovations in social learning interventions to stimulate local GW governance are also showing prom- ise in India and Ethiopia42,43 and suggest increased community steward- ship over GW resources as an entry point for arresting depletion. A yet different solution proposed in India has been to use solar-driven GW pumps to produce ele","11284"
"12482","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

The three-day workshop initiated the face-to-face portion of the ToT program, which was co-designed by national partners from the government and Sustainable Healthy Diets. It builds upon a foundational e-course, a subsequent ToT design workshop, and online webinars. The 31 people who were trained comprise the first cohort of expert trainers and will support the implementation of Ethiopia’s food systems transformation roadmap. The ToT program in Ethiopia builds on a new Food Systems Manual, an initiative led by the Ministry of Agriculture to provide a single, coherent resource for everyone working on food systems in the country. While the Manual focuses on helping stakeholders understand ‘what is a food system,’ the ToT program focuses on building stakeholder awareness on how to steer food systems transformation towards sustainable healthy diets.

The ToT program in Ethiopia builds on a new Food Systems Manual, an initiative led by the Ministry of Agriculture to provide a single, coherent resource for everyone working on food systems in the country.While the Manual focuses on helping stakeholders understand  what is a food system, the ToT program focuses on building stakeholder awareness on how to steer food systems transformation towards sustainable healthy diets. The program is designed to build skills in three areas: How to conduct a food systems analysis to local food system challenges in Ethiopia; How to build and maintain effective multi-stakeholder collaborations to implement Ethiopias food systems transformation roadmap; and How to facilitate institutional or organizational changes that support the envisioned outcomes of Ethiopias food systems transformation roadmap. The workshop was only one step for participants in the ToT program. Before the workshop, some participants completed an e-course on Food Systems Governance , which was developed by WCDI as part of SHiFT, and all participants attended a webinar. Both the e-course and webinar introduced key concepts of food systems transformation and the tools to conduct food systems and multi-stakeholder analysis. At the workshop, participants applied what they had learned to locally contextualized case studies and engaged in participatory exercises and discussions to learn from each other. Like any ToT program, the ambition is for the participants to replicate what they have learned and teach other food systems actors in other locations across Ethiopia with the same curriculum and materials used in the workshop. Before they start cascading the ToT program, the Ministry of Agriculture is using the expert trainers to lead awareness creation training courses. One course for the private sector was offered on June 22, 2024, and a second course for youth organizations was conducted on June 29, 2024. The training workshop was held April 17-19, 2024, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Members of SHiFT, Krista Kruft, Sr. Advisor Multi-Stakeholder Collaborations, and Katherine Pittore, Advisor Food and Nutrition from Wageningen University and Research facilitated the workshop with support from Belay Terefe Mengesha, SHiFT Country Coordinator, from the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT. The training workshop followed a design workshop , which was held in October 2023 also in Addis Ababa. The International Food Policy Research Institute and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT lead SHiFT in close collaboration with Wageningen University and Research and with contributions fromthe International Potato Center . SHiFT combines high-quality nutritional and social science research capacity with development partnerships to generate innovative, robust solutions that contribute to healthier, more sustainable dietary choices and consumption of sustainable healthy diets. It builds on CGIARs unparalleled track record of agricultural research for development, including ten years of work on food systems and nutrition under the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health .

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our role is to issue a report on the Financial Statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
Our audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with those standards, the independent auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:
- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;
- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the Financial statements;
- Assesses the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the independent auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;
- Evaluates the overall presentation of the Financial Statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

UNIFIED GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN CGIAR (ONE CGIAR)
Since 2019, the CGIAR System has embarked on a process of reform, referred to as One CGIAR, to implement changes endorsed by the System Council to drive major progress in key areas where innovation is needed, anchored in more unified governance, institutions, country engagement, and funding. 111 CGIARs Centers (One CGIAR Centers) adopted this unified governance from October 2020, whereby their respective Boards of Trustees/Governing Boards appointed the same voting members of the CGIAR System Board to their boards. Following these decisions, those members represent a two-thirds majority of voting membership on each Center Board. In 2022, the Integration Framework Agreement (IFA) was developed to confirm and clarify the path to One CGIAR. The IFA
was approved by the 11 One CGIAR Centers and the CGIAR System Organization and signed in February 2023. The purpose of the IFA is to set forth the objectives and core components of an integrated partnership in a way that furthers the Parties own mandates and that is consistent with the parties respective governing instruments and host country agreements.
During 2023 an independent review of the unified governance arrangements (the Unified Governance Review) was carried out to determine whether they achieve the intended purpose or whether adjustments need to be made. The One CGIAR Centers and the System Organization approved the recommendations in December 2023.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD
Prof. Lindiwe Majele Sibanda an integrated partnership to
The year 2023 marked significant progress in CGIARs journey towards operating as an integrated partnership to enhance our ability to deliver on our critical mission. A major milestone was achieved with the signing of the Integration Framework Agreement (IFA) by 13 CGIAR Centers (One CGIAR Centers) and the CGIAR System Organization. This agreement recognizes that adopting a cohesive approach across the CGIAR system will greatly improve our ability to deliver on CGIARs mandate and the individual mandates of each Center.
Central to this agreement was the implementation of a unified governance approach (Unified Governance Review). The goals were to provide more cohesive strategic direction and to foster alignment and cohesion in decision-making across Center Boards and the System Board. To assess the effectiveness of this unified governance structure, an independent review was conducted in 2023. The findings, presented in November, provided a strong foundation for the System Council, System Board, and One CGIAR Centers to agree on a set of recommendations in December 2023, paving the way for implementation in 2024.
Amidst these governance developments, CGIAR made substantial progress in delivering on our 2030 Research and Innovation Strategy. The 20222024 business plan encompassed 31 research initiatives to radically realign food, land, and water systems. These initiatives were strategically designed to drive meaningful, sustainable impact across five critical areas: Nutrition, Health, and Food Security; Poverty Reduction, Livelihoods, and Jobs; Gender Equality, Youth, and Social Inclusion; Climate Adaptation and Mitigation; and Environmental Health and Biodiversity. Progress is transparently reported via an online dashboard.
2023 also saw the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), joining the One CGIAR integrated partnership. ICRISAT plays a vital role in delivering a food and nutrition secure future in the semi-arid tropics, and its welcome participation in the integrated partnership will enable One CGIAR to deliver greater impact where it is needed most.
The year also brought changes to our executive leadership. We bade farewell to Dr. Claudia Sadoff, CGIARs inaugural Executive Managing Director, who retired on August 1st. Professor Andrew Campbell served as Interim Executive Managing Director until the appointment of Dr. Ismahane Elouafi on December 1st. We extend our gratitude to Dr. Sadoff and Professor Campbell for their contributions to CGIAR and warmly welcome Dr. Elouafi in her new role.
In 2023, the CGIAR agreed to implement a significant reform to its integrated partnership, resulting in a more streamlined allocation of resources and considerable budget savings. The System Organization's total expenditure for the year was 16% lower than projected. However, it showed an increase against 2022, reflecting a strategic reinvestment of resources towards activities designed to bolster the functioning of CGIAR as an integrated partnership, thereby underlining the effectiveness of the reform.
The Board is therefore pleased to acknowledge the growing financial stability and improvement in the management of the System Organizations financial resources. Throughout 2023, the structure and resources of the CGIAR System Organization were strategically utilized to support CGIARs activities. The Board remains confident that, with sound financial and programmatic planning, the System Organization is well-equipped to deliver on its mission. On behalf of the System Board, I wish to express sincere appreciation to our funders, science partners and dedicated staff of the System Organization and CGIAR Centers for their commitment to our mission throughout 2023.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
Our approach to risk
CGIAR recognizes that taking and managing risk is an integral part of delivering on its strategy. Effective risk management is critical to CGIARs success and is a key element of good governance. The CGIAR System Organization, being one constituent part of CGIAR, cannot deliver on its mission without collective awareness of the evolving risks faced as opportunities are pursued.
The CGIAR System Board has the responsibility for ensuring that the CGIAR System Organization has in place appropriate risk management and internal control systems and practices, and for determining the nature and extent of risk it is willing to take for the organization to achieve its strategic objectives. The top
strategic, operational, and financial risks of the CGIAR System Organization due to its unique role in supporting CGIAR strategies are largely intertwined with the CGIAR strategy. The CGIAR System Organization primarily facilitates CGIAR-wide initiatives and actions. An Executive Risk Review cycle by the Executive Management Team to discuss and action top risks for CGIAR is in place. Updates provide visibility to different bodies and audiences e.g. Audit Finance and Risk Committee (AFRC), Assurance and Oversight Committee (AOC) and Internal Audit function. The schedule of periodic System Board meetings ensures that timely information on risk is provided for the Board to discharge its responsibilities.
Top risks for CGIAR and the System Organization
Outlined below are the top 5 risk items identified and diligently monitored by the Executive Management Team
Inability to implement CGIAR vision
Unable to complete institutional and scientific integration at speed and level envisioned. This may impact delivery, reputation and relationships with partners.
Technology & data risk
Vulnerability to cyberattacks such as data breaches and ransomware can result in data loss, financial damage, and reputational harm. Non-compliance with data privacy regulations poses risks of fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Adoption of emerging technologies like AI introduces additional risks, requiring governance and secure development practices to address potential harm.
Inability to maintain partnerships and engage effectively with partners
Failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements
Capacity challenges amid global organizational changes
Inability to maintain partnerships and engage effectively with partners primarily due to insufficient resources (time, people, funding) but also due to failure to understand complex stakeholder issues, big universe of new players and poor knowledge on stakeholders and partners may impact CGIARs delivery on the five impact areas and its credibility.
Failure to meet our legal (contractual or regulatory) obligations, including what is defined by host country agreements, could impact our relationships with host countries and partners, continuity of operations, reputation and funding.
The transformation within OneCGIAR has been ongoing for several years. While the IFA and UGR bring clarity, there is a potential risk of divergent expectations and a lack of mutual understanding regarding the objectives, tasks, and resource distribution within global teams. Therefore, there is a risk of decreased staff motivation, heightened anxiety, and a potential loss of high-performing personnel.

MANAGEMENT STATEMENTS OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management has direct responsibility for the accounting of all System Organization expenditures and has maintained a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records of the System Organization are properly kept. On 17 June 2016, the CGIAR Centers and Funders adopted a CGIAR System Framework that sets out the overall governing framework of the CGIAR System and provides for a System Council and a CGIAR System Organization with its two constituent parts, a CGIAR System Board and CGIAR System Management Office.
The accompanying annual financial statements of the CGIAR System Organization for the year ended 31 December 2023, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit (PwC) has been engaged to examine and report on the financial statements of the CGIAR System Organization. The firms examination is conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). PwCs report accompanies these 2023 Financial Statements.
The System Organization has fiduciary responsibility for all Window 1 funds disbursed from the CGIAR Trust Fund managed by the World Bank to Centers that are leading or participating in CGIAR Research Programs and Platforms. Consistent with prior years, these funds are not reflected in the Financial Statements of the System Organization. These funds are for the implementation of CGIAR Research Programs and Platforms and are reported in the financial statements of the respective Centers.
The System Organizations Chief Audit Executive performs internal audit assurance and advisory engagements according to a Charter approved by the CGIAR System Board pursuant to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. Internal Audit delivers findings and provides recommendations regarding the adequacy of the System Organizations policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation.
Separately, the System Organization prepares aggregated CGIAR System level financial information and financial dashboards which are based on the audited financial statements of all CGIAR Centers and the System Organization. The CGIAR System financial information presents System Organization and Center management, the CGIAR System Board and the System Council, with an accurate view of the Systems financial operations, which enables the identification and discernment of strategic opportunities and risks.

1. General information
2. Vision
As defined in the Charter of the CGIAR System Organization (Charter), the purpose of the System Organization is to provide support to the CGIAR System. Led by the Executive Director, the System Organization manages the day-to-day operations of the System Organization, the System Board and the System Council, and facilitates collaboration within the CGIAR System.
CGIARs vision is a world with sustainable and resilient food, land, and water systems that deliver diverse, healthy, safe, sufficient, and affordable diets, and ensure improved livelihoods and greater social equality, within planetary and regional environmental boundaries.
The CGIAR System Organization is an independent international organization with such international legal personality as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions and powers, and the fulfilment of its purposes, including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the legal capacity:
3. Mission
CGIARs mission is to deliver science and innovation that advance the transformation of food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis.
(a) to enter into treaties, agreements, arrangements and contracts;
(b) to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property;
4. Summary of significant accounting policies
(c) to institute and respond to legal proceedings.
The System Organization is not subject to statutory laws and regulations which would require the entity to prepare a full set of annual Financial Statements. However, due to decisions taken by the CGIAR System Council and the then-titled System Management Board in July 2016, the System Organization continued to operate pursuant to the Joint Agreement entered into between the CGIAR Consortium and the Fund Council of the CGIAR Fund represented by the World Bank2 . Pursuant to article 19.3 of the Joint Agreement, the System Organization is required to present a full set of annual Financial Statements to provide all its stakeholders with a comprehensive annual review of its business performance and financial positions.
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Financial Statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
4.1. Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IFRS also cover all International Accounting Standards (IAS) and all interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, previously called the Standard Interpretation Committee (SIC).
1.1. Headquarters Agreement with the French Government
The Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (Financial Statements), have been prepared on a going concern basis. The approach adopted by the System Organization for the management of financial risks is discussed in Note 5 Management of Financial Risks below.
On March 04, 2013, the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers signed an Agreement with the French Government regarding Headquarters of the Consortium and its privileges and immunities in the French Territory3. On March 31, 2015, an agreement was signed with the Rgion Occitanie (formerly titled Languedoc-Roussillon) providing an office building located at 1000, avenue Agropolis, F-34394 Montpellier Cedex 5, France, from where the System Organization operates. The building includes 790 sqm of office, meeting and open space, and the facility is built on a piece of land of approximately 1,000 sqm, which is part of the Agricultural Agropolis Park. The facility is provided by the Rgion Occitanie free of charge except for an agreed upon late modification for which the System Organization agreed to reimburse the Rgion with a payment of Euro 10,474 during the first five years of occupation. The agreement is in place for a duration of 20 years and, if not renewed, the facility shall be returned to the Rgion Occitanie.
Financial statement formats and related classification criteria adopted by the Organization, in accordance with IAS 1  Presentation of Financial Statements, are as follows:
Statement of Financial Position has been prepared using the current/non-current distinction;
Statement of Activities and Other Comprehensive Income has been prepared by classifying expenses based on their function;
Cash Flow statement presents the cash flows generated by operating activities using the indirect method.
2. Approved by the Fund Council on April 05, 2011, and the System Management Board July 2016;
3. As now amended by the French Government in December 2016, to reflect the June 2016 governance transition and the new operating name of the CGIAR System Organization.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4.2. Other accounting policies
A brief description of the accounting policies and principles adopted in preparing the Financial Statements is provided in the following pages.
The System Organization recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the System Organization and risks and rewards of the underlying goods or services have been transferred.
(a) Foreign currency translations
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements are measured in US Dollars, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the System Organization operates (the functional currency). Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are converted at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each fiscal year. Grants received in currencies other than US dollars are recorded at market exchange rates in effect at the time the grant is received or, if outstanding as of December 31, revalued at the market exchange rate in effect on that day.
Transactions and balances
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognized in the income statement.
c) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions, other short-term and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
d) Accounts receivable
Receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequent-
ly measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Receivables are generally defined as claims held against others for the future receipt of money, goods or services, and include claims from Funders, advances to employees, and advances to CGIAR Centers and claims against third parties for services rendered.
Accounts receivable from Funders consist of claims from Funders for grants pledged in accordance with the terms specified by the Funder. It also pertains to claims for expenses paid on behalf of projects more than cash received from Funders.
b) Revenue recognition
Recognition
Grant revenue
Most of the revenue is derived through restricted grants.
 Unrestricted grants: receivables from unrestricted grants are recognized in full in the period specified by the Funder.
Restricted grants are those that are received from a transfer of resources, including Window 1 funds transferred from the CGIAR Trust Fund, in return for past or future compliance with specific conditions. These grants are recognized as revenue once there is reasonable assurance that the System Organization has complied with the funders conditions. Restricted grants are recognized as revenue to the extent of expenses for that grant are incurred.
 Restricted grants: receivables from restricted grants are recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract.
 Receivables from employees are recognized as they arise and settled when payment is received.
 Advances to CGIAR Centers are recognized when the cash or other assets are delivered to the Center or when a payment is made to settle a Centers liability.
Grants revenues are segregated into:
 Restricted Portfolio: Window 1 funds received from CGIAR Research Programs or Platforms that is recognized as revenue only as expenses are incurred in support of the specific activities supported by the CGIAR Research Programs or Platform.
 Restricted Non-portfolio: Window 1 funds received from the CGIAR Trust Fund that is recognized as revenue only as expenses are incurred in support of the operations of the System Organization.
 Other receivables are recognized upon the occurrence of an event or transaction which gives the System Organization a legal claim against others.
e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are valued at acquisition cost, net of the corresponding accumulated depreciation, and accumulated losses for impairment that:
 Are held by the System Organization for the delivery of its
mission;
Other revenue
 Are expected to be used for more than one year; and
Other revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

"12485","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Workshops raised awareness of opportunities for young people and the private sector in sustainable food systems transformation in Ethiopia As the challenges to sustainable food systems grow, it becomes more important to engage a diversity of voices. One of the objectives of Sustainable Healthy Diets is to facilitate multi-stakeholder engagement in food systems transformation processes. Awareness raising workshops are one of the strategies. In June 2024, national partners and Sustainable Healthy Diets held workshops with the private sector and young people. Participants from both groups were recruited from networks facilitated by the Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) Movement in Ethiopia. The objectives of the workshops were similar: to create a shared understanding of the concepts, approaches, and frameworks used by the Government of Ethiopia to describe sustainable food systems transformation and to provide an update on the current status of the process. The workshop content emphasized how sustainable food systems transformation depends on multi-stakeholder collaboration and helped participants to see what their role could be in this change process.

One of the objectives of the CGIAR Research Initiative on Sustainable Healthy Diets through Food Systems Transformation (SHiFT) is to facilitate multistakeholder engagement in food systems transformation processes. One way it is doing this is by collaborating with partners in national governments to raise awareness and increase understanding of food systems concepts through workshops offered to different groups of stakeholders. In Ethiopia, SHiFT works with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, a group known as Strategic Partners . This group is collectively implementing activities that align with the Government of Ethiopias own food systems transformation agenda, or what is frequently referred to as their roadmap. The Strategic Partners and SHiFT recently held workshops with two groups of stakeholders that are critical for sustainable food systems transformation  the private sector and young people. Participants from both groups were recruited from networks facilitated by the Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) Movement in Ethiopia . Professionals from agricultural businesses, food processing companies, distributors, retailers, and relevant industry associations attended the workshop on June 22, 2024. Young people, early career professionals working in government, NGOs, research, and the private sector, participated in the workshop on June 29, 2024. In total, 44 people participated. The objectives of the workshops were similar: to create a shared understanding of the concepts, approaches, and frameworks used by the Government of Ethiopia to describe sustainable food systems transformation and to provide an update on the current status of the food systems transformation process. The workshop content emphasized how sustainable food systems transformation depends on multistakeholder collaboration and helped participants to see what their role could be in this change process. For example, during the workshop, young people identified several things they could do to support food systems to transition in a healthy and sustainable direction in Ethiopia. Some of their ideas included organizing a campaign, using digital platforms like social media to share knowledge through storytelling or animated videos with their peers, and in rural communities, thinking about different platforms that could be used to create awareness about the positive benefits of planting edible trees. A couple of the participants recommendations to SHiFT and the Strategic Partners was to offer more training on dedicated topics, like financing opportunities for food systems innovation, and to establish an online platform  maybe through social media  so they can exchange resources, share experiences, and follow-up on intentions made during the workshop. The workshop organizers plan to encourage ongoing collaboration and knowledge-sharing among the participants. Another next step will be to conduct similar workshops with groups working at subnational levels in Ethiopia. The June workshops and future workshops are part of a training of trainers (ToT) program on food systems co-developed by Strategic Partners and SHiFT in Ethiopia. To date, there are 31 expert trainers from government ministries, departments, and agencies, plus universities, NGOs, think tanks, and United Nations agencies ready to teach other food systems actors in locations across Ethiopia. Three expert trainers from the ToT program facilitated the recent awareness raising workshops. The International Food Policy Research Institute and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT lead SHiFT in close collaboration with Wageningen University and Research and with contributions from the International Potato Center . SHiFT combines high-quality nutritional and social science research capacity with development partnerships to generate innovative, robust solutions that contribute to healthier, more sustainable dietary choices and consumption of sustainable healthy diets. It builds on CGIARs unparalleled track record of agricultural research for development, including ten years of work on food systems and nutrition under the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health .

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CGIAR SYSTEM MANAGEMENT BOARD
OPINION
In compliance with the assignment entrusted to you by us, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of CGIAR System Organisation (the Company) for the year ended 31 December 2023 (the Financial Statements).
In our opinion, the Financial statements present fairly, in all material respect, the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European union.
BASIS FOR OPINION
Audit Framework
We conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Independent Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
Independence
We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de dontologie) for chartered accountants.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance
for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.
These Financial Statements were prepared under the responsibility of the System Management Board.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our role is to issue a report on the Financial Statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
Our audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with those standards, the independent auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:
- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;
- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the Financial statements;
- Assesses the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the independent auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;
- Evaluates the overall presentation of the Financial Statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Since 2019, the CGIAR System has embarked on a process of reform, referred to as One CGIAR, to implement changes endorsed by the System Council to drive major progress in key areas where innovation is needed, anchored in more unified governance, institutions, country engagement, and funding. 111 CGIARs Centers (One CGIAR Centers) adopted this unified governance from October 2020, whereby their respective Boards of Trustees/Governing Boards appointed the same voting members of the CGIAR System Board to their boards. Following these decisions, those members represent a two-thirds majority of voting membership on each Center Board. In 2022, the Integration Framework Agreement (IFA) was developed to confirm and clarify the path to One CGIAR. The IFA
was approved by the 11 One CGIAR Centers and the CGIAR System Organization and signed in February 2023. The purpose of the IFA is to set forth the objectives and core components of an integrated partnership in a way that furthers the Parties own mandates and that is consistent with the parties respective governing instruments and host country agreements.
During 2023 an independent review of the unified governance arrangements (the Unified Governance Review) was carried out to determine whether they achieve the intended purpose or whether adjustments need to be made. The One CGIAR Centers and the System Organization approved the recommendations in December 2023.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD
Prof. Lindiwe Majele Sibanda an integrated partnership to
The year 2023 marked significant progress in CGIARs journey towards operating as an integrated partnership to enhance our ability to deliver on our critical mission. A major milestone was achieved with the signing of the Integration Framework Agreement (IFA) by 13 CGIAR Centers (One CGIAR Centers) and the CGIAR System Organization. This agreement recognizes that adopting a cohesive approach across the CGIAR system will greatly improve our ability to deliver on CGIARs mandate and the individual mandates of each Center.
Central to this agreement was the implementation of a unified governance approach (Unified Governance Review). The goals were to provide more cohesive strategic direction and to foster alignment and cohesion in decision-making across Center Boards and the System Board. To assess the effectiveness of this unified governance structure, an independent review was conducted in 2023. The findings, presented in November, provided a strong foundation for the System Council, System Board, and One CGIAR Centers to agree on a set of recommendations in December 2023, paving the way for implementation in 2024.
Amidst these governance developments, CGIAR made substantial progress in delivering on our 2030 Research and Innovation Strategy. The 20222024 business plan encompassed 31 research initiatives to radically realign food, land, and water systems. These initiatives were strategically designed to drive meaningful, sustainable impact across five critical areas: Nutrition, Health, and Food Security; Poverty Reduction, Livelihoods, and Jobs; Gender Equality, Youth, and Social Inclusion; Climate Adaptation and Mitigation; and Environmental Health and Biodiversity. Progress is transparently reported via an online dashboard.
2023 also saw the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), joining the One CGIAR integrated partnership. ICRISAT plays a vital role in delivering a food and nutrition secure future in the semi-arid tropics, and its welcome participation in the integrated partnership will enable One CGIAR to deliver greater impact where it is needed most.
The year also brought changes to our executive leadership. We bade farewell to Dr. Claudia Sadoff, CGIARs inaugural Executive Managing Director, who retired on August 1st. Professor Andrew Campbell served as Interim Executive Managing Director until the appointment of Dr. Ismahane Elouafi on December 1st. We extend our gratitude to Dr. Sadoff and Professor Campbell for their contributions to CGIAR and warmly welcome Dr. Elouafi in her new role.
In 2023, the CGIAR agreed to implement a significant reform to its integrated partnership, resulting in a more streamlined allocation of resources and considerable budget savings. The System Organization's total expenditure for the year was 16% lower than projected. However, it showed an increase against 2022, reflecting a strategic reinvestment of resources towards activities designed to bolster the functioning of CGIAR as an integrated partnership, thereby underlining the effectiveness of the reform.
The Board is therefore pleased to acknowledge the growing financial stability and improvement in the management of the System Organizations financial resources. Throughout 2023, the structure and resources of the CGIAR System Organization were strategically utilized to support CGIARs activities. The Board remains confident that, with sound financial and programmatic planning, the System Organization is well-equipped to deliver on its mission. On behalf of the System Board, I wish to express sincere appreciation to our funders, science partners and dedicated staff of the System Organization and CGIAR Centers for their commitment to our mission throughout 2023.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
Our approach to risk
CGIAR recognizes that taking and managing risk is an integral part of delivering on its strategy. Effective risk management is critical to CGIARs success and is a key element of good governance. The CGIAR System Organization, being one constituent part of CGIAR, cannot deliver on its mission without collective awareness of the evolving risks faced as opportunities are pursued.
The CGIAR System Board has the responsibility for ensuring that the CGIAR System Organization has in place appropriate risk management and internal control systems and practices, and for determining the nature and extent of risk it is willing to take for the organization to achieve its strategic objectives. The top
strategic, operational, and financial risks of the CGIAR System Organization due to its unique role in supporting CGIAR strategies are largely intertwined with the CGIAR strategy. The CGIAR System Organization primarily facilitates CGIAR-wide initiatives and actions. An Executive Risk Review cycle by the Executive Management Team to discuss and action top risks for CGIAR is in place. Updates provide visibility to different bodies and audiences e.g. Audit Finance and Risk Committee (AFRC), Assurance and Oversight Committee (AOC) and Internal Audit function. The schedule of periodic System Board meetings ensures that timely information on risk is provided for the Board to discharge its responsibilities.
Top risks for CGIAR and the System Organization
Outlined below are the top 5 risk items identified and diligently monitored by the Executive Management Team
Inability to implement CGIAR vision
Unable to complete institutional and scientific integration at speed and level envisioned. This may impact delivery, reputation and relationships with partners.
Technology & data risk
Vulnerability to cyberattacks such as data breaches and ransomware can result in data loss, financial damage, and reputational harm. Non-compliance with data privacy regulations poses risks of fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Adoption of emerging technologies like AI introduces additional risks, requiring governance and secure development practices to address potential harm.
Inability to maintain partnerships and engage effectively with partners
Failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements
Capacity challenges amid global organizational changes
Inability to maintain partnerships and engage effectively with partners primarily due to insufficient resources (time, people, funding) but also due to failure to understand complex stakeholder issues, big universe of new players and poor knowledge on stakeholders and partners may impact CGIARs delivery on the five impact areas and its credibility.
Failure to meet our legal (contractual or regulatory) obligations, including what is defined by host country agreements, could impact our relationships with host countries and partners, continuity of operations, reputation and funding.
The transformation within OneCGIAR has been ongoing for several years. While the IFA and UGR bring clarity, there is a potential risk of divergent expectations and a lack of mutual understanding regarding the objectives, tasks, and resource distribution within global teams. Therefore, there is a risk of decreased staff motivation, heightened anxiety, and a potential loss of high-performing personnel.

MANAGEMENT STATEMENTS OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management has direct responsibility for the accounting of all System Organization expenditures and has maintained a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records of the System Organization are properly kept. On 17 June 2016, the CGIAR Centers and Funders adopted a CGIAR System Framework that sets out the overall governing framework of the CGIAR System and provides for a System Council and a CGIAR System Organization with its two constituent parts, a CGIAR System Board and CGIAR System Management Office.
The accompanying annual financial statements of the CGIAR System Organization for the year ended 31 December 2023, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit (PwC) has been engaged to examine and report on the financial statements of the CGIAR System Organization. The firms examination is conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). PwCs report accompanies these 2023 Financial Statements.
The System Organization has fiduciary responsibility for all Window 1 funds disbursed from the CGIAR Trust Fund managed by the World Bank to Centers that are leading or participating in CGIAR Research Programs and Platforms. Consistent with prior years, these funds are not reflected in the Financial Statements of the System Organization. These funds are for the implementation of CGIAR Research Programs and Platforms and are reported in the financial statements of the respective Centers.
The System Organizations Chief Audit Executive performs internal audit assurance and advisory engagements according to a Charter approved by the CGIAR System Board pursuant to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. Internal Audit delivers findings and provides recommendations regarding the adequacy of the System Organizations policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation.
Separately, the System Organization prepares aggregated CGIAR System level financial information and financial dashboards which are based on the audited financial statements of all CGIAR Centers and the System Organization. The CGIAR System financial information presents System Organization and Center management, the CGIAR System Board and the System Council, with an accurate view of the Systems financial operations, which enables the identification and discernment of strategic opportunities and risks.

1. General information
2. Vision
As defined in the Charter of the CGIAR System Organization (Charter), the purpose of the System Organization is to provide support to the CGIAR System. Led by the Executive Director, the System Organization manages the day-to-day operations of the System Organization, the System Board and the System Council, and facilitates collaboration within the CGIAR System.
CGIARs vision is a world with sustainable and resilient food, land, and water systems that deliver diverse, healthy, safe, sufficient, and affordable diets, and ensure improved livelihoods and greater social equality, within planetary and regional environmental boundaries.
The CGIAR System Organization is an independent international organization with such international legal personality as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions and powers, and the fulfilment of its purposes, including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the legal capacity:
3. Mission
CGIARs mission is to deliver science and innovation that advance the transformation of food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis.
(a) to enter into treaties, agreements, arrangements and contracts;
(b) to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property;
4. Summary of significant accounting policies
(c) to institute and respond to legal proceedings.
The System Organization is not subject to statutory laws and regulations which would require the entity to prepare a full set of annual Financial Statements. However, due to decisions taken by the CGIAR System Council and the then-titled System Management Board in July 2016, the System Organization continued to operate pursuant to the Joint Agreement entered into between the CGIAR Consortium and the Fund Council of the CGIAR Fund represented by the World Bank2 . Pursuant to article 19.3 of the Joint Agreement, the System Organization is required to present a full set of annual Financial Statements to provide all its stakeholders with a comprehensive annual review of its business performance and financial positions.
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Financial Statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
4.1. Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IFRS also cover all International Accounting Standards (IAS) and all interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, previously called the Standard Interpretation Committee (SIC).
1.1. Headquarters Agreement with the French Government
The Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (Financial Statements), have been prepared on a going concern basis. The approach adopted by the System Organization for the management of financial risks is discussed in Note 5 Management of Financial Risks below.
On March 04, 2013, the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers signed an Agreement with the French Government regarding Headquarters of the Consortium and its privileges and immunities in the French Territory3. On March 31, 2015, an agreement was signed with the Rgion Occitanie (formerly titled Languedoc-Roussillon) providing an office building located at 1000, avenue Agropolis, F-34394 Montpellier Cedex 5, France, from where the System Organization operates. The building includes 790 sqm of office, meeting and open space, and the facility is built on a piece of land of approximately 1,000 sqm, which is part of the Agricultural Agropolis Park.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4.2. Other accounting policies
A brief description of the accounting policies and principles adopted in preparing the Financial Statements is provided in the following pages.
The System Organization recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the System Organization and risks and rewards of the underlying goods or services have been transferred.
(a) Foreign currency translations
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements are measured in US Dollars, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the System Organization operates (the functional currency). Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are converted at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each fiscal year. Grants received in currencies other than US dollars are recorded at market exchange rates in effect at the time the grant is received or, if outstanding as of December 31, revalued at the market exchange rate in effect on that day.
Transactions and balances
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognized in the income statement.
c) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions, other short-term and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
d) Accounts receivable
Receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequent-
ly measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Receivables are generally defined as claims held against others for the future receipt of money, goods or services, and include claims from Funders, advances to employees, and advances to CGIAR Centers and claims against third parties for services rendered.
Accounts receivable from Funders consist of claims from Funders for grants pledged in accordance with the terms specified by the Funder. It also pertains to claims for expenses paid on behalf of projects more than cash received from Funders.
b) Revenue recognition
Recognition
Grant revenue
Most of the revenue is derived through restricted grants.
 Unrestricted grants: receivables from unrestricted grants are recognized in full in the period specified by the Funder.
Restricted grants are those that are received from a transfer of resources, including Window 1 funds transferred from the CGIAR Trust Fund, in return for past or future compliance with specific conditions. These grants are recognized as revenue once there is reasonable assurance that the System Organization has complied with the funders conditions. Restricted grants are recognized as revenue to the extent of expenses for that grant are incurred.
 Restricted grants: receivables from restricted grants are recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract.
 Receivables from employees are recognized as they arise and settled when payment is received.
 Advances to CGIAR Centers are recognized when the cash or other assets are delivered to the Center or when a payment is made to settle a Centers liability.
Grants revenues are segregated into:
 Restricted Portfolio: Window 1 funds received from CGIAR Research Programs or Platforms that is recognized as revenue only as expenses are incurred in support of the specific activities supported by the CGIAR Research Programs or Platform.
 Restricted Non-portfolio: Window 1 funds received from the CGIAR Trust Fund that is recognized as revenue only as expenses are incurred in support of the operations of the System Organization.
 Other receivables are recognized upon the occurrence of an event or transaction which gives the System Organization a legal claim against others.
e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are valued at acquisition cost, net of the corresponding accumulated depreciation, and accumulated losses for impairment that:
 Are held by the System Organization for the delivery of its
mission;
Other revenue
 Are expected to be used for more than one year; and
Other revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

"12531","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

Human well-being cannot be attained without ensuring secure access to water, energy, and food resources, as well as maintaining a healthy environment. The Water-Energy-Food-Environment (WEFE) Nexus presents intricate interlinkages with the concept of an inclusive society, where every individual, regardless of background or circumstances, has an opportunity to fully participate and benefit from societal resources and opportunities equitably. The intersectionality of WEFE Nexus with human security underscores the complex interconnections between access to resources, societal inclusion, and the protection of individual well-being. Understanding the intersectionality of the WEFE Nexus can contribute to fostering an inclusive society and human security through: conflict prevention; equal access and distribution of resources; community participation and engagement; promotion of diversity; addressing gender inequality and social exclusion; resilience building; and sustainable development. This discussion brief investigates and conceptualizes the intersectionality between the WEFE Nexus and the concepts of inclusive society and human security. This intersectionality is highlighted through three examples from the MENA, SSA, and Asia-Pacific regions. It contains insights from a literature review and a summary of discussion points from a three-day Royal Academy of Engineering s Frontiers Symposium The Nexus in Action: Navigating the Water-Energy-Food-Environment Nexus for Climate Resilient and Inclusive Futures held from 7-9 February 2024, in Amman, Jordan jointly hosted by the Royal Scientific Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering.

In recent years, the intricate interconnections between the WEFE nexus sectors and climate variability have become increasingly apparent. Intertwined crises including food, energy, and financial alongside extreme climate events such as droughts and floods have resulted in slower and less inclusive socioeconomic growth, as well as political instability, particularly affecting human security in developing regions such as the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and Western Asia (FAO and IFAD 2015; FAO 2023). For example, more than 85 percent of the population in SSA will not have electricity by 2023. Most developing countries aiming to eradicate poverty face challenges in sourcing affordable energy for remote and urban areas (Guelleh et al. 2023).
Individual and collective efforts towards integrated and inclusive solutions to enhance human well-being and security are being challenged despite the increasing demand (Carmona-Moreno et. al. 2021; IPCC 2023). These challenges include poverty, inequality, and injustice, as well as economic, institutional, social, and capacity barriers. The situation is further complicated by siloed responses, lack of financial resources, difficulties accessing technology and finance, and trade-offs with sustainable development goals (SDGs) (IPCC 2023). These underlying conditions exacerbated by systematic shocks such as conflicts, climate risks, and transboundary water issues, contribute to food insecurity, forced displacement, a decline in real income, and livelihood disruptions (Daher et al. 2018). Therefore, there is an urgent need for a transparent framework to assess the trade-offs and synergies within the complex web of interdependencies across systems.
Provisioning water, energy, and food is pivotal in advancing social and economic development (Mujtaba et al. 2017; Garcia and You 2016), as they are closely intertwined with the basic sustenance and well-being of human life, thus making them crucial for human security. A growing body of literature emphasizes how environmental degradation has a profound impact on people's livelihoods. According to UNDP (1994), environmental security constitutes one of the seven components of human security. Specifically, the WEFE nexus holds significant importance in fostering inclusive societies and human security, given its profound impact on livelihoods (Swain and Jägerskog 2016; Von Uexkull et al. 2016; Van Baalen and Mobjörk 2018).
The WEFE nexus represents an approach geared towards enhancing synergies and managing trade- offs at a systemic level among water, energy, food, environments, and other land use sectors (Jalonen et al. 2022). This methodology integrates planning, management, and governance across various sectors and scales (Garcia and You 2016). It effectively addresses conflicting priorities among sectors, facilitates information flow, and reduces duplication of efforts and resources (Hoff 2011; Carmona-Moreno et. al. 2021; UN 2018). Moreover, the WEFE nexus
This discussion brief investigates and conceptualizes the intersectionality between the WEFE nexus and the concepts of inclusive society and human security. This intersectionality is highlighted through three examples from the MENA, SSA, and Asia-Pacific regions. It contains insights from a literature review and a summary of discussion points from a three-day Royal Academy of Engineering’s Frontiers Symposium ‘The Nexus in Action: Navigating the Water-Energy- Food-Environment Nexus for Climate Resilient and Inclusive Futures’1 held from 7-9 February 2024, in Amman, Jordan jointly hosted by the Royal Scientific Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering.

WEFE nexus intersections with inclusive society and human security
An inclusive society is defined as a ""society for all in which every individual, each with rights and responsibilities, has an active role to play"" (UN 1995, 65). However, recent rapid population growth has been closely linked to a surge in demand for natural resources, as well as exacerbating interconnected challenges such as water scarcity, climate change, land degradation, energy insecurity, biodiversity loss, and food insecurity among others. Human well-being cannot be attained without ensuring secure access to water, energy, and food resources as well as maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Amid the multifaceted humanitarian, climate, and ecological emergencies of today, the importance of supporting individuals, especially vulnerable groups in fragile contexts, cannot be overstated. It's crucial to ensure that these groups feel active, connected, and valued within society addressing the social exclusion experienced by many daily.
Lately, the WEFE nexus approach has been urging a shift from resource-centered to people- centered methodologies (Jalonen et al. 2022). It now emphasizes the significant impacts of resource governance and management on various stakeholders, particularly vulnerable groups such as women, youth, and the elderly. There is increasing evidence indicating that integrating considerations of gender equality and social inclusion into WEFE nexus approaches can foster stronger ownership, and demand-driven solutions. Moreover, it contributes to more effective, equitable, and sustainable interventions for both current and future generations (Jalonen et al. 2022; Zaremba et al. 2023).
Livelihood security involves ensuring access to necessities such as food, shelter, clean water, energy, employment, and, protection from immediate health risks (IPCC 2014). According to FAO and IFAD (2015), over 800 million people worldwide were chronically undernourished in 2015, lacking sufficient food for a healthy and active life. Addressing food security for these individuals places an additional strain on water resources, with over 70 percent of available water being used for agriculture (Mujtaba et al. 2017).
Moreover, the agri-food chain consumes substantial amounts of energy, which accounts for approximately 30
3
percent of global energy consumption, predominantly sourced from fossil fuels. FAO (2014) proposed an ""energy smart"" program aimed at enhancing access to clean and renewable energy services within the agri-food sector.
Human security is defined differently across various disciplines. The definition used in this discussion brief is provided by the Commission on Human Security (CHS) which aims to ""protect the vital core of all human lives in ways that enhance human freedoms and human fulfillment"". According to CHS (2003), this involves establishing political, social, environmental, economic, military, and cultural systems that collectively provide individuals with the essential elements for survival, sustenance, and dignity.
Security extends beyond the mere availability, accessibility, and affordability of resources; it must also address the variability and extreme conditions such as heatwaves, droughts, price shocks, and the psychological resilience of vulnerable populations. Inadequate policies and governance structures often result in conflicting demands on natural resources, leading to potential conflicts within, and between countries [Box 1]. Additionally, scholars highlight the substantial risks posed by climate change in these areas. Essential aspects of life and livelihood, such as food, water, and shelter are intricately linked to not only weather and climate but also to various economic and societal factors (IPCC 2023). Moreover, human security is often threatened by unjust political, social, and economic structures; by competition for power and resources among fragmented social groups; and, in some cases, by the impacts of external military intervention (UNDP 2009).
Preserving natural resources and ensuring benefits for resource-dependent communities and inclusive societies are prerequisites to achieve human security in the context of challenging climate, and increasing impacts of disasters (Peras et al. 2021; Löhr et al. 2021). Climate-related risks to health, livelihood, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with average global warming of 1.5 °C (IPCC 2023). If the WEFE nexus principles are adopted efficiently, they can support inclusive society efforts in the shorter term, and human security efforts in the long term. Sharma and Kumar (2020) revealed that policy coordination among all the actors (at all levels and local levels in particular) governing the WEFE nexus is key to promoting equitable allocation and access to resources. Mismanagement of these resources puts the human security situation at risk (Babiker et al. 2019).

WEFE nexus at play
The WEFE nexus presents intricate interlinkages with the concept of an inclusive society, where every individual regardless of background or circumstance, has the opportunity to participate fully, and benefit equitably from societal resources and opportunities. Further, the intersectionality with human security underscores the complex interconnections between access to resources, societal inclusion, and the protection of individual well- being. Here's how this intersectionality can contribute to fostering an inclusive society and human security:
• Conflict prevention: Competition over limited resources, such as water and arable land can escalate into conflicts, exacerbate insecurity, and undermine efforts to foster inclusive societies [Box 1]. Addressing these conflicts and promoting peaceful resource management is crucial for stability and security. The WEFE nexus encourages collaborative and integrated approaches to resource management, reducing the risk of conflicts and promoting peaceful coexistence. By fostering dialogue and cooperation among diverse stakeholders, the WEFE nexus contributes to conflict prevention and the promotion of inclusive societies (Al-Zu’bi et al. 2023).
• Equitable access and distribution of resources:
• Equitable access and distribution of resources: Access to water, energy, food, and a healthy environment is essential for human well-being and security. However, disparities in resource distribution often exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities and threaten the livelihoods of marginalized communities. The WEFE nexus emphasizes the interconnectedness of water, energy, and food systems, all of which are essential for human well- being and security. By promoting equitable access, distribution, and sustainable management of these resources, the WEFE nexus can help ensure that all members of society, regardless of background or circumstance, have the means to thrive, and has access to essential resources necessary for their well- being and development.
• Community engagement, participation, and empowerment: An inclusive society empowers communities, and values the voices as well as contributions of all its members. The WEFE nexus approach encourages multi-stakeholder engagement and participatory decision-making processes related to WEFE and environmental issues, allowing diverse perspectives to be heard and considered in resource management and governance initiatives. This fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment among communities, leading to more inclusive outcomes [Box 2].

• Promotion of diversity: Inclusive societies celebrate diversity and recognize the power of different perspectives, cultures, and ways of life. The WEFE Nexus approach acknowledges the diversity of stakeholders involved in water, energy, food, and environmental management, and seeks to integrate diverse knowledge systems and approaches to address complex challenges. This promotes inclusivity by ensuring that the needs and priorities of diverse communities are considered and respected.
• Addressing gender inequality and social exclusion: Women and marginalized groups often bear the brunt of resource scarcity and environmental degradation. Promoting gender equality and social inclusion is paramount for building resilient communities and ensuring the well- being of all members of society (ADB 2013). Further, social exclusion occurs when certain groups are denied access to resources, services, or opportunities available to others. The WEFE Nexus approach recognizes the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental factors contributing to exclusion. By addressing these interlinkages and promoting integrated solutions, the WEFE Nexus can help mitigate social exclusion and promote greater
equity and inclusion within society.
• Resilience building: Inclusive societies prioritize the needs of vulnerable and marginalized groups, ensuring their resilience in the face of environmental and socioeconomic challenges. The WEFE nexus approach, by addressing interlinked challenges such as water scarcity, food insecurity, and climate change can contribute to building resilience among these communities, thereby reducing their vulnerability and promoting inclusivity [Box 3].
• Sustainable development: Sustainable development lies at the heart of both inclusive societies and human security. Balancing environmental conservation with socioeconomic development goals can help mitigate risks and build resilience to future shocks. Adopting integrated and sustainable development strategies is key to addressing the interconnected challenges of the WEFE nexus. The WEFE nexus promotes integrated and sustainable approaches to resource management, balancing environmental, social, and economic considerations to ensure the well-being of present and future generations. By fostering sustainable development practices, the WEFE nexus enhances human security and promotes long-term
• Sustainable development: Sustainable
prosperity for all members of society.
Box 1: Conflicts over dwindling natural resources in MENA region: Sudan case study
The MENA region is projected to undergo heightened occurrences of extreme weather, including high temperatures, droughts, floods, and climate variability (Francis and Fonseca 2024; Diao et al. 2023) These changes will profoundly impact the environment, societies, and human security. Additionally, ongoing factors such as armed conflict, migration, economic and political instability, as well as resource scarcity and contamination, exacerbate the region's challenges. To enhance resilience and human security in the MENA region, it is imperative to prioritize accountable and responsive governance systems, foster economic diversification and competitiveness, and promote social cohesion and inclusivity (UNDP 2022) especially, where the provision of basic human needs, mainly food, energy, and water is at stake, for instance in Sudan (Figure 1).
rural communities, deepening the humanitarian crisis, and   exacerbating vulnerabilities across various sectors. To address   these challenges, a holistic approach is critical to enhance   human security in Sudan. It is essential to prioritize accountable   and responsive governance systems, foster economic   diversification and competitiveness, and promote social   cohesion and inclusivity. By addressing these issues, Sudan can   work towards ensuring sustainable access to water, energy, and   food resources, thereby improving the well-being and security   of its population.  Figure 2.

Box 2: Empowering communities to restore forests and biodiversity in Sub-Saharan Africa: Lake Kariba case study
SSA is an extremely diverse and culturally rich region with the fastest growing population– currently around 1.37 billion people. The continent has the potential for a prosperous socioeconomic transformation that would strengthen its position in the global economy. However, this potential is severely diminished due to poly-crises of rapid urbanization, a legacy of social tensions, ongoing conflict, and mass migration and displacement. More frequent and worsening heatwaves, heavy rains, floods, and prolonged droughts are having devastating impacts on communities and economies, particularly threatening those at greatest risk. Despite all efforts undertaken, levels of water, food, and energy security in Africa are inadequately low and exacerbate social inequalities. Approximately 53 percent of SSA’s population live without access to electricity, and 115 people die from diseases linked to improper hygiene, poor sanitation, and contaminated water every hour (Carmona-Moreno et. al. 2021). In a region where water availability and storage capacity are severely strained, agriculture which is the core of Africa’s livelihoods and national economies, is being disproportionately eradicated by climate change.
The Kariba Forest Protection project demonstrates a successful example of the application of the WEFE nexus to SSA. The project lies on the shores of Lake Kariba near the Zambia-Zimbabwe border. It is one of the largest registered as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD) projects,
which is a UN climate initiative to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. The central aim of the project is to empower communities to restore forests and biodiversity. This initiative comprises three principal components that have yielded significant outcomes since its inception. First, establishing conservation farming practices has strengthened food security, and stabilized the production of limited agricultural land. Subsistence farmers have stopped pushing into the forest, which itself regulates local temperatures and supports groundwater recharge. Second, constructing 180 new boreholes equipped with solar power pumps improved water security. These boreholes have been built away from biodiverse areas to avoid disturbing wildlife. Third, the development of sustainable honey cultivation contributes to food security, where community members benefit from the profits generated and they no longer cut down trees to get wild honey. So far, the project has established a biodiversity corridor that protects 785,000 ha of forest and wildlife and has reduced 18 million t of CO2, and carbon credit sales have funded 1500 local school subsidies for disadvantaged students. Since 2011, the project today benefited more than 85,000 people, almost half of whom are women. Employing the WEFE nexus approach has enabled further benefits beyond the three core actions. The Kariba Project shows us that the WEFE nexus can be an instrument for climate change adaptation, urgently needed in SSA. But this requires rapid acceleration and a global increase in willingness
to invest in African markets.

Box 3: Building resilience in the Asia-Pacific region: Context of Rohingya Refugees, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh
The Asia-Pacific region faces heightened vulnerability to climate change due to its geographical characteristics, which exposes the region to various extreme weather phenomena (ADPC 2022; UNESCAP 2013). Over the past three decades, the region endured the highest number of climate-induced natural disasters, totaling 2,845 events according to the 2020 Ecological Threat Register. Individuals residing in Asia and the Pacific are six times more likely to experience the repercussions of such disasters compared to those outside the region. This heightened risk is compounded by challenges such as resource scarcity, mass migration, forced displacement, and internal conflicts, which collectively threaten regional security.
Climate variability significantly impacts essential sectors like agriculture, forestry, water, and fisheries, thus disrupting food production and livelihoods across the region. Within humanitarian contexts, the WEFE nexus underscores the intricate relationship between climate change and the well-being of displaced communities. The case study of the Rohingya refugee crisis (described below) serves as a poignant illustration, shedding light on the critical interplay between the WEFE nexus and climate ambitions in the Asia-Pacific. It emphasizes the complexity and nonlinear dynamics involved, particularly concerning human security factors such as access, safety, and consumption. In navigating these challenges, fostering inclusive resilience becomes paramount, focusing on equitable access to resources and sustainable practices. This necessitates a holistic approach that acknowledges the interconnectedness of water, energy, food, and ecosystems, and their profound implications for the region's socioeconomic fabric (Figure 4).

The Rohingya refugee crisis
Since 2017, there has been a significant influx of nearly one million Rohingya refugees from Rakhine State, Northern Myanmar into Cox’s Bazar district, Bangladesh. Among these refugees, over half are women and girls (Figure 5). Presently, the refugee population constitutes approximately one-third of the total population in Cox’s Bazar district, underscoring the critical need to provide support to host communities to foster peaceful coexistence and ensure human security. The humanitarian efforts have facilitated the harmonious coexistence of refugees by coordinating the WEFE resources. Presently, more than 10 UN agencies and 106 international and national NGOs collaborate closely with the Government
of Bangladesh to support one million Rohingya refugees and half a million Bangladeshi host communities, building toward a lasting solution. In 2023, the Bangladesh Government initiated a Joint Response Plan (JRP) for the Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis, focusing on five primary objectives: 1) Facilitating the sustainable and voluntary repatriation of Rohingya refugees/ Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMN) to Myanmar; 2) Enhancing the protection of Rohingya refugees/FDMN women, men, girls, and boys; 3) Providing life-saving assistance such as Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), food, and energy support to vulnerable populations; 4) Promoting the welfare of host communities (Figure 5); and 5) Strengthening disaster risk management and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Insights gleaned from the WEFE approach in Rohingya refugee humanitarian settings have been invaluable:
• Replicating and expanding upon current WEFE nexus practices, innovations, and solutions will foster more sustainable and inclusive water, energy, and food systems. This approach leverages opportunities to address multiple crises simultaneously and advance towards achieving the targets set by the SDGs.
• Establishing synergies among initiatives focusing on food, WASH, energy, and environment through a crosscutting, action-oriented network promoting climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability within the Rohingya refugee response.
• Securing robust, inclusive, and adaptable social protection systems through adequate financing is essential for addressing multidimensional risks and enhancing the energy and food security of vulnerable groups during crises. This fosters long-term resilience that is inclusive and sustainable.
• Embracing Accountability to Affected Population (AAP) signifies a proactive commitment from humanitarian and development actors to responsibly wield their power by acknowledging, informing, and being answerable to the people they aim to assist. The mainstreaming of AAP remains a fundamental aspect of a rights-based approach to humanitarian efforts.
• Research indicates that women and marginalized communities play integral roles in and are significantly impacted by the interplay of the WEFE nexus within the context of climate change and conflict environments.

Conceptualizing the WEFE nexus intersectionality with inclusive society and human security
This discussion brief examined and conceptualized the intersections among the WEFE nexus, inclusive societies, and human security across selected global regions. Building on insights from the Royal Academy of Engineering’s Frontiers Symposium and three regional case studies, we have developed a conceptual framework [Figure 6]. This framework encompasses four spheres and identifies key enabling factors crucial for advancing the impact pathway of the WEFE nexus. Within each sphere, various actors, whether individuals or organizations play essential roles within each system. Across the four spheres, enabling factors (e.g., finance, governance, policy, innovation and technology, research, and capacity building) are essential to ensure successful WEFE nexus implementation and influence the actions of actors, either advancing synergies or impeding tradeoffs.

2. Sphere of action: This sphere involves the adoption of the WEFE nexus approach to advance synergies, manage tradeoffs, enhance policy coherence, governance, resource efficiency, and vertical and horizontal coordination across sectors. In the long term, the direct and indirect outputs and outcomes of the WEFE nexus aim to enhance inclusivity within society.
3. Sphere of influence and benefits: This sphere includes system actors, governance structures, and processes that are influenced by WEFE nexus actions and outputs through direct engagement or the uptake and use of outputs. The resulting actions and integrated processes from the ‘sphere of action’ will influence other system actors and processes at a larger scale within society, thereby contributing to social, economic, and environmental changes and benefits. In the long term, individuals or organizations operating within society will be influenced. The expected outcomes of the WEFE nexus include changes in processes, knowledge, skills, attitudes, and/or relationships, leading to behavioral changes in specific system actors, which are attributable to WEFE nexus outputs and related activities.

Research on the food environment, the space between food production, storage, and transportation and consumption, is a relatively new area. There are numerous frameworks, typologies and metrics that make it hard to understand what the food environment is and why it matters for research, programs, and policies. On March 13, 2024, around 40 nutrition staff from the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) in Viet Nam attended a seminar to learn about food environment research and to discuss preliminary results from a study conducted by the CGIAR Research Initiative on Sustainable Healthy Diets through Food Systems Transformation (SHiFT) in Viet Nam. The study team included researchers from NIN, the International Food Policy Research Institute, Wageningen University and Research, the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development , and the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development . The study was conducted from 2022-2023 in three districts  Dong Da, Dong Anh, and Moc Chau  representing a continuum of urban, peri-urban, and rural sites. Over 3,000 adolescents (1218-year-olds) and more than 6,000 outlets that sell food or drinks were surveyed across all three sites. Two important messages about food environment challenges for adolescents diets To start, Inge Brouwer , Senior Research Fellow at IFPRI and SHiFT Lead, provided a short introduction about SHiFT and its goals. Then Jef Leroy , Senior Research Fellow at IFPRI and SHiFT Work Package 1 Lead, explained more about the food environment and the findings from the SHiFT survey in Viet Nam . Results from the study suggest two things about adolescent diets and their food environment. One, diet quality is overall low. Adolescents do not consume enough healthy foods. On the positive side, adolescents have a relatively low consumption of unhealthy foods. Two, adolescents live in a food environment that makes it challenging to avoid unhealthy options. For instance, in urban areas, most adolescents live less than 50 meters  or a 30-second walk  from the nearest vendor selling sugary drinks and ultra-processed foods. Across all the study sites, unhealthy foods were more accessible than healthy foods, like fruits. Around half of all the adolescents surveyed had consumed food or drinks away from home in the 24 hours preceding the survey. The share was highest in the rural study site. NIN staff discussed the results with the study team from IFPRI and WUR. There were several questions about methodology, specifically, the Global Diet Quality Score , and which type of foods fit into the ultra-processed food category. Several observations were made by NIN staff that the study team will incorporate as they refine the analysis. Looking ahead Two conclusions are emerging from the study results. Improving the diet quality of adolescents will require increasing their consumption of healthy foods and keeping their consumption of unhealthy foods low. The nature of the adolescent food environment with widespread availability of unhealthy foods suggests that keeping the consumption of these foods at their current low levels could be challenging. As one of SHiFTs Strategic Partners in Viet Nam, NIN will be working closely with SHiFT to continue discussions about the research results and to develop ideas for further research and interventions that align with Viet Nams goals for sustainable food systems transformation. The International Food Policy Research Institute and the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT lead SHiFT in close collaboration with Wageningen University and Research and with contributions from the International Potato Center . SHiFT combines high-quality nutritional and social science research capacity with development partnerships to generate innovative, robust solutions that contribute to healthier, more sustainable dietary choices and consumption of sustainable healthy diets. It builds on CGIARs unparalleled track record of agricultural research for development, including ten years of work on food systems and nutrition under the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH). The visit was by invitation of the NIN Board of Directors and hosted by Associate Professor Dr. Truong Tuyet Mai. A more detailed summary of the visit was featured on the NIN website .

The Global Diet Quality Score: Data Collection Options and Tabulation Guidelines
April 2021
Introduction
Poor quality diets are associated with adverse health outcomes related to both undernutrition and overnutrition and are a leading cause of disease globally (Global Burden of Disease [GBD] 2016). Yet, until recently, we have lacked a standard, relatively simple, and validated method for routinely measuring diet quality1 in population- based surveys across contexts (Miller et al. 2020), and therefore have lacked a means by which to assess and track this critical dimension of health and well-being.
In 2018, Intake  Center for Dietary Assessment launched a 2-year research initiative2 to support a consortium of researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Department of Nutrition and the National Public Health Institute (INSP), Mexico, to develop and validate metrics of diet quality that would be appropriate for collection through routine population-based surveys and that would be fit for purpose for inclusion in global monitoring frameworks.
The work entailed constructing a set of candidate food group-based metrics that account for the quantity of consumption in the scoring method. Secondary food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and quantitative 24-hour dietary recall datasets across different regions of the world were analyzed over the course of the 2-year research initiative to examine the association of each candidate metric with a range of diet quality outcomes related to nutrient adequacy and noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk . The inclusion of two cohort datasets in the analyses (one from Mexico and one from the United States) allowed for the evaluation of the responsiveness of outcomes to changes in metric score over time and provided a rigorous design for examining the association of the candidate diet quality metrics developed with NCD risk-related outcomes.
From these analyses, an overall metric of diet quality  the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS)  was identified. The GDQS was designed to be appropriate for use among non-pregnant, non-lactating women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but has also been shown through secondary data analysis to be valid for use in high-income countries, thereby providing a simple, standardized metric appropriate for population-based measurement of diet quality globally.3
1 For operational purposes, we have defined diet quality as a diet that is both adequate in nutrients and also protective against diet -related non-communicable disease risk outcomes. Miller et al (2020) use the following definition: a metric that is valid to assess both d iet-related maternal and child health (MCH) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) outcomes.
2 The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) research initiative was launched by Intake  Center for Dietary Assessment. The research was led by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Department of Nutrition, and was carried out in collaboration with researchers at the National Public Health Institute (INSP), Mexico. Funding for the research was provided by FHI Solutions, recipient of a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant to support Intake.
3 A set of manuscripts to report on these results has been submitted to the Journal of Nutrition for publication consideration in a GDQS- focused Journal of Nutrition Supplement. The Journal of Nutrition Supplement, The Global Diet Quality Score: A New Method to Collect and Analyze Population-Based Data on Diet Quality, is expected to be published in September 2021.
GDQS Metric Design
The GDQS is an entirely food-based metric, consisting of 25 food groups: 16 healthy food groups, 7 unhealthy food groups, and 2 food groups (red meat, high-fat dairy) that are unhealthy when consumed in excessive amounts4.
For 24 of the GDQS food groups, three ranges of quantity of consumption are defined (in grams/day) and used in scoring the metric: low, medium, and high. For one food group (high-fat dairy), four ranges of quantity of consumption are used: low, medium, high, and very high.
Each respondent receives points for each GDQS food group, according to the quantity of consumption consumed for that food group during the 24-hour reference period. The points associated with the healthy GDQS food groups increase for each higher quantity of consumption category. The points associated with the unhealthy GDQS food groups decrease for each higher quantity of consumption category. For the two food groups that are unhealthy in excessive consumption (red meat, high-fat dairy), the points associated with the GDQS food group increase up to a certain threshold of quantity of consumption, after which the points decrease.
The overall GDQS is a sum of the points across all 25 GDQS food groups. The GDQS has a possible range of 0 to 49. Population-based cutoffs of 15 and 23 have been identified for the GDQS, to allow for reporting the percent of the population at high risk for poor diet quality outcomes (GDQS <15) and the percent of the population at low risk for poor diet quality outcomes (GDQS 23), based on the information collected for the 24- hour reference period.
Table 1 provides the list of GDQS food groups, the quantity of consumption categories per GDQS food group, and the points assigned to each GDQS food group category of consumption, to tabulate the GDQS.
GDQS Sub-Metrics and Other Sub-Analyses
Collecting data on the GDQS also allows for tabulation of two GDQS sub-metrics: the GDQS positive (GDQS+) sub-metric and the GDQS negative (GDQS) sub-metric. The GDQS+ is the total score across the 16 healthy GDQS food groups, with a possible range of 0 to 32. The GDQS is the total score across the 7 unhealthy GDQS food groups and the 2 GDQS food groups that are unhealthy when consumed in excessive amounts, with a possible range of 0 to 17.
The GDQS+ and GDQS offer value by providing more targeted information about the relative contribution of healthy and unhealthy food group consumption to overall diet quality in a particular setting.
GDQS data can also be analyzed to report the percent of the population consuming each GDQS food group in the reference 24-hour period and the percent of the population consuming low, middle, and high (or very high, in the case of high-fat dairy) quantities of consumption of each food group in the reference 24-hour period.
How the GDQS Is Different from Other Diet Metrics
The GDQS has several novel features in comparison to other simple diet-related metrics. Unlike most existing diet quality-related metrics, the GDQS is designed to be sensitive to diet-related outcomes associated with both undernutrition and overnutrition. The metric is entirely food-based and therefore does not require the use of a food composition table for analysis. The GDQS includes an expanded set of food groups in comparison to most existing simple food-based metrics and incorporates a measure of quantity of consumption in the metric scoring, to allow for a more sensitive assessment of healthy diets.
4 The naming of these food group categories as healthy, unhealthy, and unhealthy when consumed in excessive amoun ts provides a simple method for communicating how the foods in each food group contribute to an overall healthy diet, as reflected in the epidemiological literature and operationalized by the GDQS.

How to Collect Data on the GDQS
Various data collection methods can be used to derive data for the GDQS. The choice of method depends on the availability of existing dietary data and the resources available to collect new data. Quantitative 24-hour dietary recall data are an ideal data source for the GDQS. FFQ data can also be used to derive the GDQS, but for these data to be a robust data source for the GDQS, the FFQ instrument must comprehensively list the foods commonly consumed by the target population and allow for the quantity of intake of each food to be derived for a 24-hour reference period. To facilitate routine data collection for the GDQS, Intake developed an electronic data collection tool to provide a simple method to collect population-based GDQS data at relatively low cost and with low respondent burden. More information about the GDQS app is provided in Annex 1.
How to Tabulate the GDQS
Detailed guidance on how to tabulate the GDQS is provided in Annexes 2, 3, and 4. Annex 2 provides guidance on how to use quantitative 24-hour dietary recall data to tabulate the GDQS. Annex 3 provides guidance on how to tabulate the GDQS using food frequency data. Annex 4 provides guidance on how to tabulate the GDQS data that have been collected using the GDQS app.
Details about the operational definition of each GDQS food group are provided in Table 2. This table should be referred to when using quantitative 24-hour dietary recall data or FFQ data to tabulate the GDQS, to ensure the correct classification of foods into GDQS food groups. When using the GDQS app for data collection, foods are already pre-classified into the correct GDQS food group, using a master database that is pre-installed in the GDQS app.
The GDQS app was designed to provide comparable data on the GDQS to data tabulated using quantitative 24- hour dietary recall data. We note, however, that primary validation studies would still be useful to evaluate if the method used by the GDQS app for estimating the quantity of consumption allows for the amount of food consumed per GDQS food group to be estimated with sufficient precision.
Although the GDQS can also be tabulated with FFQ data, we expect that FFQ data sources would not necessarily result in GDQS results that are directly comparable to those collected using a 24-hour reference period. The use of a pre-determined food list along with the use of a longer than 24-hour recall period in a FFQ instrument is likely to result in differences in the number of foods/food groups reported as consumed, and in the quantities derived as consumed for a 24-hour period, when compared to GDQS data tabulated using quantitative 24-hour dietary recall data or data collected using the GDQS app.
How to Use GDQS Data
The GDQS is a population-based metric of diet quality. GDQS data are intended to be reported and used at the population or sub-group level, not at the individual level. GDQS data can be used for population-based assessment, target-setting, program/policy design, and cross- or within-country comparison. The GDQS is also appropriate for assessing population-level changes in diet quality and can therefore also be used for monitoring and evaluation of programs and policies that aim to improve diet quality.

Annex 1. The GDQS App for Data Collection
The GDQS app is an electronic data collection tool developed by Intake with the aim of providing a standard, easy-to-use method for collecting low-cost, time-relevant data on diet quality to inform and monitor country-specific programs and policies for agriculture and nutrition.
The GDQS app uses an open recall method to capture all foods consumed by a respondent during a 24- hour reference period and eliminates food group classification error by incorporating into the app an extensive database of foods, pre-classified into their corresponding GDQS food group. In this way, when the respondent mentions a food consumed during the open recall, the enumerator records the food in the app, and the app classifies the food in the appropriate food group automatically based on pre-populated information. In the case that a food reported as consumed is missing from the master database of foods, the enumerator records the food using free text and must manually classify the food into the corresponding GDQS food group.
To collect quantity of consumption information for the GDQS, the enumerator reminds the respondent of the foods that the respondent reported consuming for a given GDQS food group and asks the respondent to visualize the total amount of food consumed and compare the amount (volume) to a set of ten 3D cubes, each of which has been predetermined in size to reflect the volume that corresponds to a quantity of consumption cutoff (in grams) that is used for a food group to tabulate the GDQS.
The volume for each of the ten 3D cubes was determined by using the gram cutoff for each food group in the GDQS metric, along with data on the physical density of the foods belonging to each food group (weight in grams  physical density = volume) (Moursi et al. unpublished 2021). In the case that the respondent selects a cube that corresponds exactly to a quantity of consumption cutoff for the GDQS food group that is being asked about, a probing question follows, to ask the respondent if the respondent consumed as much as or more than indicated by the cube size or slightly less than the volume indicated by the cube size5.
There are seven main steps involved in collecting data for the GDQS with the GDQS app:
Step 1  Respondent ID and demographic information
Step 2  Foods and drinks consumed in the past 24 hours using open recall
Step 3  Ingredients of mixed dishes (recipes)
Step 4  Additional information on certain foods to classify them into the GDQS food groups
Step 5  Deep fried foods
Step 6  Caloric sweeteners
Step 7  Quantity consumed at the food group level
Data collection is currently estimated to require an average of approximately 10 minutes per respondent, with the amount of time required for data collection highly dependent on the complexity of the diet consumed6.
5 In addition to this method of using 3D cubes for estimating the category of quantity of consumption for each GDQS food group, Intake is also currently exploring use of a second potential method that could also be used for a simple estimation of the quantity of consumption of the foods consumed. We intend to update this document once this second method is further developed and documented, to provide a second option for how to derive the quantity of consumption data for tabulation of the GDQS when usi ng the GDQS app for data collection.
6 The average time required for data collection with the GDQS app will be updated once we have initial pre -test data from a sufficient number of respondents in a LMIC context.

Annex 2. Guidance for Tabulating the GDQS with Quantitative 24-Hour Dietary Recall Data
When using quantitative 24-hour dietary recall data to tabulate the GDQS, only dietary data collected from respondents for the first day of the 24-hour dietary recall is used.
There are six main steps required to process and tabulate the GDQS when using quantitative 24-hour dietary recall data. These steps are described briefly below.
Step 1. Process the dietary data to reflect gram consumption of each single food/ingredient
Before tabulating the GDQS, the data must first be processed so that the total consumption amount (in grams) for each food reported as consumed during the 24-hour recall period is available, by respondent. Mixed dishes reported as consumed should be disaggregated into their component ingredients using recipe information. Each individual ingredient in a mixed dish should be treated as a single food, with a gram consumption amount provided, based on the weight of the ingredient in the form in which it was consumed (e.g., raw, cooked). Some composite foods like breads and cakes are exceptions and should be treated as single foods for the purpose of data processing and analysis. For the purpose of tabulating the GDQS, it is generally not necessary to disaggregate the ingredients of a mixed dish into levels finer than that of a GDQS food group. The only exception to this is the high-fat dairy food group, for which hard cheese should be separated from other high-fat dairy products.
Step 2. Assign each single food/ingredient reported as consumed to its correct GDQS food group
Once the data are organized to provide total consumption amount (in grams) by single food or ingredient of mixed dish, each food or ingredient listed in the dataset needs to be classified into the corresponding GDQS food group. Refer to Table 2 for detailed information to guide how to classify each food and mixed dish ingredient into the correct GDQS food group.
Note that there are some foods that will not be classified in any GDQS food group. Some key examples include: alcohol, semi-solid and solid fats, insects, coconuts, and coconut products (e.g., coconut milk). Liquid coconut oil is an exception and is scored under the liquid oil category.
There are a few GDQS food groups that require special attention when assigning foods and ingredients of mixed dishes to the corresponding GDQS food group. The classification instructions for these GDQS food groups are described below.
A. High-fat dairy
The GDQS high-fat dairy food group includes all high-fat dairy products except ice cream and whipped cream.
Because there are significant differences in the nutrient density across the foods included in the high-fat dairy group (e.g., hard cheese has a higher nutrient density than milk) and dairy products are widely consumed globally, for the purpose of scoring the GDQS, hard cheese and other dairy products in the high-fat dairy group are treated differently.
During data processing, the high-fat dairy group should be subdivided into a high-fat hard cheese and a high-fat other dairy sub-category. Hard cheeses should be classified in the high-fat hard cheese sub- category and all other high-fat dairy products in the high-fat other dairy sub-category.

B. Liquid oil
Depending on the level of detail collected and the methods used to collect the 24-hour dietary recall data, information may not be available on whether and how much liquid oil was consumed by each respondent. When this is the case, an algorithm can be used to classify liquid oil consumption for each respondent. This algorithm is described in Step 4 below.
C. Purchased deep fried food
The purchased deep fried food category includes only deep fried foods that were purchased. Deep fried foods that were prepared at home are not classified in this GDQS food group. To make the classification for this food group reliably, when possible, data collection instruments should be designed to collect information on whether a deep fried food was prepared at home or purchased, as there is evidence that the oils used in the preparation of deep fried foods by vendors, restaurants, and other commercial entities are more deleterious than oils that are used in preparation of deep fried foods made at home (Cahill et al. 2014).
If the data collection instrument did not provide information on whether the deep fried food consumed was purchased or prepared at home, data analysts will need to use their knowledge of the local cuisine and customary eating behaviors of the surveyed population to guide the classification of foods into this food group.
Note that foods that are classified in the purchased deep fried food category are double-classified: The food should be classified both in the purchased deep fried food category and in the food category to which the food normally belongs. For example, deep fried white potatoes that are purchased should be classified both in the purchased deep fried food category and in the white roots and tubers category. If a food that is deep fried and purchased is deep fried using liquid oil, the oil is not classified in the liquid oil food group (by virtue of the comparatively deleterious fatty acid profile of these oils), while if the food is deep fried at home using liquid oil, the oil is classified in the liquid oil group (see Box 1).
Box 1. Approach for classifying foods deep fried at home or purchased
GDQS food group Example: Example: classification Potatoes deep fried at home Purchased deep fried potatoes Purchased deep fried food No Yes White roots and tubers Yes Yes Liquid oil Yes (if deep fried with liquid oil) No
Step 3. Sum the quantity of consumption (in grams) of all foods/ingredients reported as consumed for each GDQS food group, by respondent
Once the foods/ingredients reported as consumed have been classified into the correct GDQS food group, the total amount (in grams) of all foods/ingredients reported as consumed per GDQS food group are summed, by respondent. For any GDQS food group that was not reported by a respondent as consumed (information known after carrying out Step 2), the respondent should be given a value of 0 grams for quantity of consumption for that food group. The only exception is if information on liquid oil consumption was not directly collected with the data collection instrument.
At the end of Step 3, each respondent should have a total consumption value in grams for each GDQS food group (except potentially for the liquid oil GDQS food group). Some food groups require special instructions for carrying out this step; these are described below.
Global Diet Quality Score: Data Collection Options and Tabulation Guidelines
11
A. High-fat dairy
To account for the difference in nutrient density between high-fat hard cheese and high-fat other dairy, multiple the quantity (in grams) reported as consumed for the foods/ingredients classified in the high-fat hard cheese sub-category by a factor of 6.1. Multiplying the quantity of high-fat hard cheese consumed (in grams) by a factor of 6.1 allows the quantity of high-fat hard cheese consumed to be converted into a consumption quantity that is more reflective of/equivalent to the nutrient density of high- fat other dairy (Willett et al. 2020).

In Vietnam, the rapidly changing food environmentshaped by globalization, urbanization, economic growth, and other factorshas led to changes in dietary patterns and heightened the risk of malnutrition among adolescents. These transformations have notably led to the increased availability and consumption of ultra-processed foods, which is likely to have adverse dietary and health implications. The CGIAR Research Initiative on Sustainable Healthy Diets through Food Systems Transformation (SHiFT) seeks to address these issues by stimulating both the demand for and supply of sustainable nutritious foods. In 2023, researchers from the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT and the National Institute of Nutrition of Vietnam launched activities aimed at co-creating interventions to enhance food environments and foster the adoption of sustainable healthy diets among adolescents. Their primary objectives are to document adolescents perceptions of their food environments, identify the main challenges and opportunities for accessing and consuming sustainable healthy diets, and co-design community action plans to enhance these food environments for better diets. The first stage of this research focused on understanding adolescents perceptions of their food environments through participatory video-making. This initial stage provided insights into how adolescents perceive and interact with their food environments. The study was conducted in three districts: Moc Chau (rural), Dong Anh (peri-urban), and Dong Da (urban). It involved 54 adolescents (ages 1517 years) from selected public schools, with a balanced representation of boys and girls. Watch the introductory video to see how we engage with adolescents during the first stage of the research. Our preliminary results from the first stage indicate that adolescents food environments are characterized by a range of channels including wet markets, street stalls, food stores, restaurants, school canteens, convenience stores, supermarkets and more. This mix provides adolescents with access to a wide range of both fresh, locally sourced foods and processed and packaged foods. Brice Even , researcher at the Alliance, explains: Overall, there seems to be a relative balance between healthy and unhealthy food options available to adolescents, but the latter are often more accessible when at school, and are likely more appealing due to their cost and convenience. For example, school canteens provide both fresh, processed and ultra-processed food options, but ultra-processed food items tend to be cheaper. Another concern is that local restaurants, convenience stores, and street stalls depicted in adolescents videos predominantly serve processed and ultra-processed foods high in sugar, salt, and fat. While fresh and minimally processed foods are available, the prevalence of processed and ultra-processed options within and around schools is significant and may contribute to less healthy eating habits among adolescents. Screenshot from the participatory videos: Adolescent in her school canteen in Dong Anh Screenshot from the participatory videos: Adolescents having breakfast in Dong Da Food prices and affordability seem to be crucial factors influencing food choices, with lots of options for affordable unhealthy snacks and beverages. School canteens offer cheaper food compared to other food outlets, with ultra-processed foods being the most inexpensive options offered. Convenience also seems to be a significant driver of food choices , where for instance, the need for quick and easy meals often results in a preference for ultra-processed, ready-to-eat options over healthier alternatives. to these foods is further compounded by the close proximity of various outlets (both within and just outside school premises), many of which remain open from early morning until late evening. Deborah Nabuuma , scientist at the Alliance and leader of this research work, notes that: Peer influence, social media, and advertisements seem to play a significant role in shaping adolescents food choices, often toward less nutritious options. Marketing predominantly promotes ultra-processed foods, most likely influencing adolescents preferences and choices. While adolescents recognize the nutritional benefits of fresh foods, their nutritional knowledge is limited and somehow reflects wrong messages conveyed through processed food advertisements. Screenshot from the participatory videos: Adolescents in a food outlet in Moc Chau While adolescents recognize the nutritional benefits of fresh foods, their nutritional knowledge is limited and somehow reflects wrong messages conveyed through processed food advertisements.  Deborah Nabuuma The preliminary analysis of the participatory video-making outputs reveals the complexities of adolescents food environments in Vietnam, characterized by the coexistence of traditional and modern food outlets and the significant influence of ultra-processed foods. As we advance, we will engage in participatory co-design (stage 2) at the community level, involving local stakeholdersincluding adolescents, school staff, food retailers, and local authorities in a co-analysis process involving the identification of key challenges and areas for improvement. The results of this co-analysis will provide the basis for the co-design of community-level interventions targeting the food environment to promote healthier and more sustainable food choices. Concurrently, similar participatory research is being conducted in Ethiopia, providing a comparative perspective that will deepen our understanding of adolescents food environments across diverse contexts.

Our role is to issue a report on the Financial Statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
Our audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with those standards, the independent auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:
- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;
- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the Financial statements;
- Assesses the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the independent auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;
- Evaluates the overall presentation of the Financial Statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

UNIFIED GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN CGIAR (ONE CGIAR)
Since 2019, the CGIAR System has embarked on a process of reform, referred to as One CGIAR, to implement changes endorsed by the System Council to drive major progress in key areas where innovation is needed, anchored in more unified governance, institutions, country engagement, and funding. 111 CGIARs Centers (One CGIAR Centers) adopted this unified governance from October 2020, whereby their respective Boards of Trustees/Governing Boards appointed the same voting members of the CGIAR System Board to their boards. Following these decisions, those members represent a two-thirds majority of voting membership on each Center Board. In 2022, the Integration Framework Agreement (IFA) was developed to confirm and clarify the path to One CGIAR. The IFA
was approved by the 11 One CGIAR Centers and the CGIAR System Organization and signed in February 2023. The purpose of the IFA is to set forth the objectives and core components of an integrated partnership in a way that furthers the Parties own mandates and that is consistent with the parties respective governing instruments and host country agreements.
During 2023 an independent review of the unified governance arrangements (the Unified Governance Review) was carried out to determine whether they achieve the intended purpose or whether adjustments need to be made. The One CGIAR Centers and the System Organization approved the recommendations in December 2023.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD
Prof. Lindiwe Majele Sibanda an integrated partnership to
The year 2023 marked significant progress in CGIARs journey towards operating as an integrated partnership to enhance our ability to deliver on our critical mission. A major milestone was achieved with the signing of the Integration Framework Agreement (IFA) by 13 CGIAR Centers (One CGIAR Centers) and the CGIAR System Organization. This agreement recognizes that adopting a cohesive approach across the CGIAR system will greatly improve our ability to deliver on CGIARs mandate and the individual mandates of each Center.
Central to this agreement was the implementation of a unified governance approach (Unified Governance Review). The goals were to provide more cohesive strategic direction and to foster alignment and cohesion in decision-making across Center Boards and the System Board. To assess the effectiveness of this unified governance structure, an independent review was conducted in 2023. The findings, presented in November, provided a strong foundation for the System Council, System Board, and One CGIAR Centers to agree on a set of recommendations in December 2023, paving the way for implementation in 2024.
Amidst these governance developments, CGIAR made substantial progress in delivering on our 2030 Research and Innovation Strategy. The 20222024 business plan encompassed 31 research initiatives to radically realign food, land, and water systems. These initiatives were strategically designed to drive meaningful, sustainable impact across five critical areas: Nutrition, Health, and Food Security; Poverty Reduction, Livelihoods, and Jobs; Gender Equality, Youth, and Social Inclusion; Climate Adaptation and Mitigation; and Environmental Health and Biodiversity. Progress is transparently reported via an online dashboard.
2023 also saw the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), joining the One CGIAR integrated partnership. ICRISAT plays a vital role in delivering a food and nutrition secure future in the semi-arid tropics, and its welcome participation in the integrated partnership will enable One CGIAR to deliver greater impact where it is needed most.
The year also brought changes to our executive leadership. We bade farewell to Dr. Claudia Sadoff, CGIARs inaugural Executive Managing Director, who retired on August 1st. Professor Andrew Campbell served as Interim Executive Managing Director until the appointment of Dr. Ismahane Elouafi on December 1st. We extend our gratitude to Dr. Sadoff and Professor Campbell for their contributions to CGIAR and warmly welcome Dr. Elouafi in her new role.
In 2023, the CGIAR agreed to implement a significant reform to its integrated partnership, resulting in a more streamlined allocation of resources and considerable budget savings. The System Organization's total expenditure for the year was 16% lower than projected. However, it showed an increase against 2022, reflecting a strategic reinvestment of resources towards activities designed to bolster the functioning of CGIAR as an integrated partnership, thereby underlining the effectiveness of the reform.
The Board is therefore pleased to acknowledge the growing financial stability and improvement in the management of the System Organizations financial resources. Throughout 2023, the structure and resources of the CGIAR System Organization were strategically utilized to support CGIARs activities. The Board remains confident that, with sound financial and programmatic planning, the System Organization is well-equipped to deliver on its mission. On behalf of the System Board, I wish to express sincere appreciation to our funders, science partners and dedicated staff of the System Organization and CGIAR Centers for their commitment to our mission throughout 2023.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
Our approach to risk
CGIAR recognizes that taking and managing risk is an integral part of delivering on its strategy. Effective risk management is critical to CGIARs success and is a key element of good governance. The CGIAR System Organization, being one constituent part of CGIAR, cannot deliver on its mission without collective awareness of the evolving risks faced as opportunities are pursued.
The CGIAR System Board has the responsibility for ensuring that the CGIAR System Organization has in place appropriate risk management and internal control systems and practices, and for determining the nature and extent of risk it is willing to take for the organization to achieve its strategic objectives. The top
strategic, operational, and financial risks of the CGIAR System Organization due to its unique role in supporting CGIAR strategies are largely intertwined with the CGIAR strategy. The CGIAR System Organization primarily facilitates CGIAR-wide initiatives and actions. An Executive Risk Review cycle by the Executive Management Team to discuss and action top risks for CGIAR is in place. Updates provide visibility to different bodies and audiences e.g. Audit Finance and Risk Committee (AFRC), Assurance and Oversight Committee (AOC) and Internal Audit function. The schedule of periodic System Board meetings ensures that timely information on risk is provided for the Board to discharge its responsibilities.
Top risks for CGIAR and the System Organization
Outlined below are the top 5 risk items identified and diligently monitored by the Executive Management Team
Inability to implement CGIAR vision
Unable to complete institutional and scientific integration at speed and level envisioned. This may impact delivery, reputation and relationships with partners.
Technology & data risk
Vulnerability to cyberattacks such as data breaches and ransomware can result in data loss, financial damage, and reputational harm. Non-compliance with data privacy regulations poses risks of fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Adoption of emerging technologies like AI introduces additional risks, requiring governance and secure development practices to address potential harm.
Inability to maintain partnerships and engage effectively with partners
Failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements
Capacity challenges amid global organizational changes
Inability to maintain partnerships and engage effectively with partners primarily due to insufficient resources (time, people, funding) but also due to failure to understand complex stakeholder issues, big universe of new players and poor knowledge on stakeholders and partners may impact CGIARs delivery on the five impact areas and its credibility.
Failure to meet our legal (contractual or regulatory) obligations, including what is defined by host country agreements, could impact our relationships with host countries and partners, continuity of operations, reputation and funding.
The transformation within OneCGIAR has been ongoing for several years. While the IFA and UGR bring clarity, there is a potential risk of divergent expectations and a lack of mutual understanding regarding the objectives, tasks, and resource distribution within global teams. Therefore, there is a risk of decreased staff motivation, heightened anxiety, and a potential loss of high-performing personnel.

MANAGEMENT STATEMENTS OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management has direct responsibility for the accounting of all System Organization expenditures and has maintained a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records of the System Organization are properly kept. On 17 June 2016, the CGIAR Centers and Funders adopted a CGIAR System Framework that sets out the overall governing framework of the CGIAR System and provides for a System Council and a CGIAR System Organization with its two constituent parts, a CGIAR System Board and CGIAR System Management Office.
The accompanying annual financial statements of the CGIAR System Organization for the year ended 31 December 2023, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit (PwC) has been engaged to examine and report on the financial statements of the CGIAR System Organization. The firms examination is conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). PwCs report accompanies these 2023 Financial Statements.
The System Organization has fiduciary responsibility for all Window 1 funds disbursed from the CGIAR Trust Fund managed by the World Bank to Centers that are leading or participating in CGIAR Research Programs and Platforms. Consistent with prior years, these funds are not reflected in the Financial Statements of the System Organization. These funds are for the implementation of CGIAR Research Programs and Platforms and are reported in the financial statements of the respective Centers.
The System Organizations Chief Audit Executive performs internal audit assurance and advisory engagements according to a Charter approved by the CGIAR System Board pursuant to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. Internal Audit delivers findings and provides recommendations regarding the adequacy of the System Organizations policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation.
Separately, the System Organization prepares aggregated CGIAR System level financial information and financial dashboards which are based on the audited financial statements of all CGIAR Centers and the System Organization. The CGIAR System financial information presents System Organization and Center management, the CGIAR System Board and the System Council, with an accurate view of the Systems financial operations, which enables the identification and discernment of strategic opportunities and risks.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
2. Vision
As defined in the Charter of the CGIAR System Organization (Charter), the purpose of the System Organization is to provide support to the CGIAR System. Led by the Executive Director, the System Organization manages the day-to-day operations of the System Organization, the System Board and the System Council, and facilitates collaboration within the CGIAR System.
CGIARs vision is a world with sustainable and resilient food, land, and water systems that deliver diverse, healthy, safe, sufficient, and affordable diets, and ensure improved livelihoods and greater social equality, within planetary and regional environmental boundaries.
The CGIAR System Organization is an independent international organization with such international legal personality as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions and powers, and the fulfilment of its purposes, including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the legal capacity:
3. Mission
CGIARs mission is to deliver science and innovation that advance the transformation of food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis.
(a) to enter into treaties, agreements, arrangements and contracts;
(b) to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property;
4. Summary of significant accounting policies
(c) to institute and respond to legal proceedings.
The System Organization is not subject to statutory laws and regulations which would require the entity to prepare a full set of annual Financial Statements. However, due to decisions taken by the CGIAR System Council and the then-titled System Management Board in July 2016, the System Organization continued to operate pursuant to the Joint Agreement entered into between the CGIAR Consortium and the Fund Council of the CGIAR Fund represented by the World Bank2 . Pursuant to article 19.3 of the Joint Agreement, the System Organization is required to present a full set of annual Financial Statements to provide all its stakeholders with a comprehensive annual review of its business performance and financial positions.
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Financial Statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
4.1. Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IFRS also cover all International Accounting Standards (IAS) and all interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, previously called the Standard Interpretation Committee (SIC).
1.1. Headquarters Agreement with the French Government
The Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (Financial Statements), have been prepared on a going concern basis. The approach adopted by the System Organization for the management of financial risks is discussed in Note 5 Management of Financial Risks below.
On March 04, 2013, the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers signed an Agreement with the French Government regarding Headquarters of the Consortium and its privileges and immunities in the French Territory3. On March 31, 2015, an agreement was signed with the Rgion Occitanie (formerly titled Languedoc-Roussillon) providing an office building located at 1000, avenue Agropolis, F-34394 Montpellier Cedex 5, France, from where the System Organization operates. The building includes 790 sqm of office, meeting and open space, and the facility is built on a piece of land of approximately 1,000 sqm, which is part of the Agricultural Agropolis Park. The facility is provided by the Rgion Occitanie free of charge except for an agreed upon late modification for which the System Organization agreed to reimburse the Rgion with a payment of Euro 10,474 during the first five years of occupation. The agreement is in place for a duration of 20 years and, if not renewed, the facility shall be returned to the Rgion Occitanie.
Financial statement formats and related classification criteria adopted by the Organization, in accordance with IAS 1  Presentation of Financial Statements, are as follows:
Statement of Financial Position has been prepared using the current/non-current distinction;
Statement of Activities and Other Comprehensive Income has been prepared by classifying expenses based on their function;

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4.2. Other accounting policies
A brief description of the accounting policies and principles adopted in preparing the Financial Statements is provided in the following pages.
The System Organization recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the System Organization and risks and rewards of the underlying goods or services have been transferred.
(a) Foreign currency translations
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements are measured in US Dollars, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the System Organization operates (the functional currency). Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are converted at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each fiscal year. Grants received in currencies other than US dollars are recorded at market exchange rates in effect at the time the grant is received or, if outstanding as of December 31, revalued at the market exchange rate in effect on that day.
Transactions and balances
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognized in the income statement.
c) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions, other short-term and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
d) Accounts receivable
Receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequent-
ly measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Receivables are generally defined as claims held against others for the future receipt of money, goods or services, and include claims from Funders, advances to employees, and advances to CGIAR Centers and claims against third parties for services rendered.
Accounts receivable from Funders consist of claims from Funders for grants pledged in accordance with the terms specified by the Funder. It also pertains to claims for expenses paid on behalf of projects more than cash received from Funders.
b) Revenue recognition
Recognition
Grant revenue
Most of the revenue is derived through restricted grants.
 Unrestricted grants: receivables from unrestricted grants are recognized in full in the period specified by the Funder.
Restricted grants are those that are received from a transfer of resources, including Window 1 funds transferred from the CGIAR Trust Fund, in return for past or future compliance with specific conditions. These grants are recognized as revenue once there is reasonable assurance that the System Organization has complied with the funders conditions. Restricted grants are recognized as revenue to the extent of expenses for that grant are incurred.
 Restricted grants: receivables from restricted grants are recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract.
 Receivables from employees are recognized as they arise and settled when payment is received.
 Advances to CGIAR Centers are recognized when the cash or other assets are delivered to the Center or when a payment is made to settle a Centers liability.
Grants revenues are segregated into:
 Restricted Portfolio: Window 1 funds received from CGIAR Research Programs or Platforms that is recognized as revenue only as expenses are incurred in support of the specific activities supported by the CGIAR Research Programs or Platform.
 Restricted Non-portfolio: Window 1 funds received from the CGIAR Trust Fund that is recognized as revenue only as expenses are incurred in support of the operations of the System Organization.
 Other receivables are recognized upon the occurrence of an event or transaction which gives the System Organization a legal claim against others.
e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are valued at acquisition cost, net of the corresponding accumulated depreciation, and accumulated losses for impairment that:
 Are held by the System Organization for the delivery of its
mission;
Other revenue
 Are expected to be used for more than one year; and
Other revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

"12640","GENDER_EQUALITY_PROMPT","# **You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating research results from CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) to determine whether they align with and contribute to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality. Your goal is to accurately assign an impact area tag that reflects the relevance and impact of the research on these specific gender equality objectives.**

### **Context:**
CGIAR is a global partnership that unites international organizations focused on research for food security. CGIAR has established specific objectives to promote gender equality, particularly in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, climate, and nutrition in developing countries. The research results you will analyze originate from various CGIAR initiatives and projects in these and related fields.

### **Research Result Components:**
Each research result includes the following details:
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the research result.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the research result, including methods and findings.
- **Research Abstract:** A summary of key findings and implications (optional).
- **Research Parsed Text:** The parsed text of the research result (optional).

### **Tagging Criteria:**
Assign a gender equality impact tag using the following criteria:

- **0 = Not Targeted:** 
  - The research does not address or contribute to CGIAR's gender equality objectives.
  - The research is unrelated to gender equality, focusing instead on different topics with no significant implications for gender-related issues.
  - Example: A study focused solely on crop yield improvements without considering gender roles, implications, or disparities.

- **1 = Significant:**
  - The research makes a meaningful contribution to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, but these are not the primary focus.
  - The research is relevant and provides insights into gender dynamics, but these are secondary to other goals.
  - Example: A study that examines the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s access to land but does not center its entire analysis on gender equality.

- **2 = Principal:**
  - The primary objective of the research is to address and directly impact CGIAR's goals in promoting gender equality.
  - The research would not have been undertaken without the intention to contribute to these specific gender equality objectives.
  - Example: A study specifically designed to develop agricultural policies aimed at improving women’s access to financial resources and closing gender gaps.

### **Key Objectives Set by CGIAR:**
- **Closing the Gender Gap:** Addressing disparities in rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.
- **Providing Opportunities:** Creating opportunities for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, with a focus on gender inclusivity.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Title and Abstract:** Determine whether the research is related to CGIAR's objectives in promoting gender equality by looking for relevant keywords or phrases, such as “gender,” “women,” “equality,” or “empowerment.”
2. **Review the Description and Parsed Text:** Assess whether the research directly contributes to CGIAR’s gender equality objectives, and how integral these objectives are to the overall study.
3. **Assign the Tag:** Based on the criteria provided, assign the most appropriate tag (0, 1, or 2) that reflects whether the research is related to and impacts CGIAR’s objectives in gender equality.
4. **Provide a Brief Justification:** Explain why you assigned this tag, referencing specific aspects of the research that influenced your decision. Make sure to clarify how the research aligns (or does not align) with CGIAR’s gender equality objectives.

### **Important Notes:**
- If the research does not relate to CGIAR's objectives in gender equality, assign a tag of **0** (Not Targeted).
- If the research mentions gender equality as an important consideration but not the primary focus, assign a tag of **1** (Significant).
- If gender equality is the primary objective of the research, assign a tag of **2** (Principal).
- When assigning a tag of **2**, ensure that the evidence clearly demonstrates that gender equality objectives were the main goals of the research and fundamental to its design.

### **Structured Output Format:**
Please provide your answer in the following format:
{ ""score"": <0|1|2>, ""explanation"": ""<Your explanation here>"" }


### **Now, analyze the following research result and assign a gender equality tag (0, 1, or 2). Provide a brief explanation for your choice, ensuring it references the criteria and objectives mentioned above. Be careful to determine whether the research is truly aligned with CGIAR's specific goals in promoting gender equality.**

Consistent with other literature on the changing Bangladeshi diet, the study found that diets have diversified away from the substantially rice-based diet consumed in the 1980s and 1990s. Although diversity of are improving, there has also been a substantial increase in demand for sugar and processed foods, which is associated with the rise in overweight and obesity prevalence. The study also showed that dietary change varies between different population groups: diets have changed the most among richer, urban households, while only marginal changes in diets were observed among poor rural households. The second study used economic models to identify the potential trade-offs and synergies of adopting different dietary patterns over different periods of time, the next 20 years (2022-2040) and the next 30 years (2022-2050). The study examined three dietary scenarios: a business-as-usual diet, a diet consistent with Bangladeshs food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs), and the planetary health diet proposed by the EAT- Lancet Commission (EAT- Lancet diet). The researchers measured how greater adoption of those diets would correlate with four socioeconomic indicators, a health indicator, and five environmental indicators. The analysis revealed that if Bangladeshs population were to adopt the national FBDGs, it would be associated with positive changes in diet quality and an overall positive impact on the environment, as compared to the business-as-usual diet scenario. The results were comparable to adopting the EAT- Lancet . SHiFT researchers from Wageningen University and Research reported engaging in productive discussions with national stakeholders about the main findings of both studies. Based on feedback from FPMU staff, the SHiFT team will engage with experts from Bangladeshi universities to further validate and discuss the studies. Areas of particular interest to the group focused on how value chains for fruits and vegetables can be adjusted to reduce food loss and waste and how proper storage facilities could extend the period of fruit and vegetable availability after the harvest season. These changes could benefit both consumers and producers, potentially leading to higher vegetable and fruit consumption and better overall diet quality. The long-run trade-off analysis showed that agricultural diversificationin particular, an increase in fruits, vegetables, pulses, and nutsis needed to ensure sufficient supply to support wider adoption of a diet based on the national FBDGs. Prior to these meetings, SHiFT researchers presented findings from their long-run trade-off analysis as a showcase session titled Quantitative Modeling within the Foresight Process during the 4 th Global Foresight4Food Workshop in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This global five-day workshop, which was attended by more than 100 delegates from 20-plus countries, focused on achieving the transformative potential of stakeholder engagement in food systems foresight. The International Food Policy Research Institute and the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT lead SHiFT in close collaboration with Wageningen University and Research and with contributions from the International Potato Center . SHiFT combines high-quality nutritional and social science research capacity with development partnerships to generate innovative, robust solutions that contribute to healthier, more sustainable dietary choices and consumption of sustainable healthy diets. It builds on CGIARs unparalleled track record of agricultural research for development, including ten years of work on food systems and nutrition under the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our role is to issue a report on the Financial Statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
Our audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with those standards, the independent auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:
- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;
- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the Financial statements;
- Assesses the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the independent auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;
- Evaluates the overall presentation of the Financial Statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

UNIFIED GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN CGIAR (ONE CGIAR)
Since 2019, the CGIAR System has embarked on a process of reform, referred to as One CGIAR, to implement changes endorsed by the System Council to drive major progress in key areas where innovation is needed, anchored in more unified governance, institutions, country engagement, and funding. 111 CGIARs Centers (One CGIAR Centers) adopted this unified governance from October 2020, whereby their respective Boards of Trustees/Governing Boards appointed the same voting members of the CGIAR System Board to their boards. Following these decisions, those members represent a two-thirds majority of voting membership on each Center Board. In 2022, the Integration Framework Agreement (IFA) was developed to confirm and clarify the path to One CGIAR. The IFA
was approved by the 11 One CGIAR Centers and the CGIAR System Organization and signed in February 2023. The purpose of the IFA is to set forth the objectives and core components of an integrated partnership in a way that furthers the Parties own mandates and that is consistent with the parties respective governing instruments and host country agreements.
During 2023 an independent review of the unified governance arrangements (the Unified Governance Review) was carried out to determine whether they achieve the intended purpose or whether adjustments need to be made. The One CGIAR Centers and the System Organization approved the recommendations in December 2023.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD
Prof. Lindiwe Majele Sibanda an integrated partnership to
The year 2023 marked significant progress in CGIARs journey towards operating as an integrated partnership to enhance our ability to deliver on our critical mission. A major milestone was achieved with the signing of the Integration Framework Agreement (IFA) by 13 CGIAR Centers (One CGIAR Centers) and the CGIAR System Organization. This agreement recognizes that adopting a cohesive approach across the CGIAR system will greatly improve our ability to deliver on CGIARs mandate and the individual mandates of each Center.
Central to this agreement was the implementation of a unified governance approach (Unified Governance Review). The goals were to provide more cohesive strategic direction and to foster alignment and cohesion in decision-making across Center Boards and the System Board. To assess the effectiveness of this unified governance structure, an independent review was conducted in 2023. The findings, presented in November, provided a strong foundation for the System Council, System Board, and One CGIAR Centers to agree on a set of recommendations in December 2023, paving the way for implementation in 2024.
Amidst these governance developments, CGIAR made substantial progress in delivering on our 2030 Research and Innovation Strategy. The 20222024 business plan encompassed 31 research initiatives to radically realign food, land, and water systems. These initiatives were strategically designed to drive meaningful, sustainable impact across five critical areas: Nutrition, Health, and Food Security; Poverty Reduction, Livelihoods, and Jobs; Gender Equality, Youth, and Social Inclusion; Climate Adaptation and Mitigation; and Environmental Health and Biodiversity. Progress is transparently reported via an online dashboard.
2023 also saw the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), joining the One CGIAR integrated partnership. ICRISAT plays a vital role in delivering a food and nutrition secure future in the semi-arid tropics, and its welcome participation in the integrated partnership will enable One CGIAR to deliver greater impact where it is needed most.
The year also brought changes to our executive leadership. We bade farewell to Dr. Claudia Sadoff, CGIARs inaugural Executive Managing Director, who retired on August 1st. Professor Andrew Campbell served as Interim Executive Managing Director until the appointment of Dr. Ismahane Elouafi on December 1st. We extend our gratitude to Dr. Sadoff and Professor Campbell for their contributions to CGIAR and warmly welcome Dr. Elouafi in her new role.
In 2023, the CGIAR agreed to implement a significant reform to its integrated partnership, resulting in a more streamlined allocation of resources and considerable budget savings. The System Organization's total expenditure for the year was 16% lower than projected. However, it showed an increase against 2022, reflecting a strategic reinvestment of resources towards activities designed to bolster the functioning of CGIAR as an integrated partnership, thereby underlining the effectiveness of the reform.
The Board is therefore pleased to acknowledge the growing financial stability and improvement in the management of the System Organizations financial resources. Throughout 2023, the structure and resources of the CGIAR System Organization were strategically utilized to support CGIARs activities. The Board remains confident that, with sound financial and programmatic planning, the System Organization is well-equipped to deliver on its mission. On behalf of the System Board, I wish to express sincere appreciation to our funders, science partners and dedicated staff of the System Organization and CGIAR Centers for their commitment to our mission throughout 2023.
System Board, to System Organization and

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
Our approach to risk
CGIAR recognizes that taking and managing risk is an integral part of delivering on its strategy. Effective risk management is critical to CGIARs success and is a key element of good governance. The CGIAR System Organization, being one constituent part of CGIAR, cannot deliver on its mission without collective awareness of the evolving risks faced as opportunities are pursued.
The CGIAR System Board has the responsibility for ensuring that the CGIAR System Organization has in place appropriate risk management and internal control systems and practices, and for determining the nature and extent of risk it is willing to take for the organization to achieve its strategic objectives. The top
strategic, operational, and financial risks of the CGIAR System Organization due to its unique role in supporting CGIAR strategies are largely intertwined with the CGIAR strategy. The CGIAR System Organization primarily facilitates CGIAR-wide initiatives and actions. An Executive Risk Review cycle by the Executive Management Team to discuss and action top risks for CGIAR is in place. Updates provide visibility to different bodies and audiences e.g. Audit Finance and Risk Committee (AFRC), Assurance and Oversight Committee (AOC) and Internal Audit function. The schedule of periodic System Board meetings ensures that timely information on risk is provided for the Board to discharge its responsibilities.
Top risks for CGIAR and the System Organization
Outlined below are the top 5 risk items identified and diligently monitored by the Executive Management Team
Inability to implement CGIAR vision
Unable to complete institutional and scientific integration at speed and level envisioned. This may impact delivery, reputation and relationships with partners.
Technology & data risk
Vulnerability to cyberattacks such as data breaches and ransomware can result in data loss, financial damage, and reputational harm. Non-compliance with data privacy regulations poses risks of fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Adoption of emerging technologies like AI introduces additional risks, requiring governance and secure development practices to address potential harm.
Inability to maintain partnerships and engage effectively with partners
Failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements
Capacity challenges amid global organizational changes
Inability to maintain partnerships and engage effectively with partners primarily due to insufficient resources (time, people, funding) but also due to failure to understand complex stakeholder issues, big universe of new players and poor knowledge on stakeholders and partners may impact CGIARs delivery on the five impact areas and its credibility.
Failure to meet our legal (contractual or regulatory) obligations, including what is defined by host country agreements, could impact our relationships with host countries and partners, continuity of operations, reputation and funding.
The transformation within OneCGIAR has been ongoing for several years. While the IFA and UGR bring clarity, there is a potential risk of divergent expectations and a lack of mutual understanding regarding the objectives, tasks, and resource distribution within global teams. Therefore, there is a risk of decreased staff motivation, heightened anxiety, and a potential loss of high-performing personnel.

MANAGEMENT STATEMENTS OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management has direct responsibility for the accounting of all System Organization expenditures and has maintained a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records of the System Organization are properly kept. On 17 June 2016, the CGIAR Centers and Funders adopted a CGIAR System Framework that sets out the overall governing framework of the CGIAR System and provides for a System Council and a CGIAR System Organization with its two constituent parts, a CGIAR System Board and CGIAR System Management Office.
The accompanying annual financial statements of the CGIAR System Organization for the year ended 31 December 2023, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit (PwC) has been engaged to examine and report on the financial statements of the CGIAR System Organization. The firms examination is conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). PwCs report accompanies these 2023 Financial Statements.
The System Organization has fiduciary responsibility for all Window 1 funds disbursed from the CGIAR Trust Fund managed by the World Bank to Centers that are leading or participating in CGIAR Research Programs and Platforms. Consistent with prior years, these funds are not reflected in the Financial Statements of the System Organization. These funds are for the implementation of CGIAR Research Programs and Platforms and are reported in the financial statements of the respective Centers.
The System Organizations Chief Audit Executive performs internal audit assurance and advisory engagements according to a Charter approved by the CGIAR System Board pursuant to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. Internal Audit delivers findings and provides recommendations regarding the adequacy of the System Organizations policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation.
Separately, the System Organization prepares aggregated CGIAR System level financial information and financial dashboards which are based on the audited financial statements of all CGIAR Centers and the System Organization. The CGIAR System financial information presents System Organization and Center management, the CGIAR System Board and the System Council, with an accurate view of the Systems financial operations, which enables the identification and discernment of strategic opportunities and risks.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
2. Vision
As defined in the Charter of the CGIAR System Organization (Charter), the purpose of the System Organization is to provide support to the CGIAR System. Led by the Executive Director, the System Organization manages the day-to-day operations of the System Organization, the System Board and the System Council, and facilitates collaboration within the CGIAR System.
CGIARs vision is a world with sustainable and resilient food, land, and water systems that deliver diverse, healthy, safe, sufficient, and affordable diets, and ensure improved livelihoods and greater social equality, within planetary and regional environmental boundaries.
The CGIAR System Organization is an independent international organization with such international legal personality as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions and powers, and the fulfilment of its purposes, including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the legal capacity:
3. Mission
CGIARs mission is to deliver science and innovation that advance the transformation of food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis.
(a) to enter into treaties, agreements, arrangements and contracts;
(b) to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property;
4. Summary of significant accounting policies
(c) to institute and respond to legal proceedings.
The System Organization is not subject to statutory laws and regulations which would require the entity to prepare a full set of annual Financial Statements. However, due to decisions taken by the CGIAR System Council and the then-titled System Management Board in July 2016, the System Organization continued to operate pursuant to the Joint Agreement entered into between the CGIAR Consortium and the Fund Council of the CGIAR Fund represented by the World Bank2 . Pursuant to article 19.3 of the Joint Agreement, the System Organization is required to present a full set of annual Financial Statements to provide all its stakeholders with a comprehensive annual review of its business performance and financial positions.
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Financial Statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
4.1. Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4.2. Other accounting policies
A brief description of the accounting policies and principles adopted in preparing the Financial Statements is provided in the following pages.
The System Organization recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the System Organization and risks and rewards of the underlying goods or services have been transferred.
(a) Foreign currency translations
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements are measured in US Dollars, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the System Organization operates (the functional currency). Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are converted at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each fiscal year. Grants received in currencies other than US dollars are recorded at market exchange rates in effect at the time the grant is received or, if outstanding as of December 31, revalued at the market exchange rate in effect on that day.
Transactions and balances
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognized in the income statement.
c) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions, other short-term and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
d) Accounts receivable
Receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequent-
ly measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Receivables are generally defined as claims held against others for the future receipt of money, goods or services, and include claims from Funders, advances to employees, and advances to CGIAR Centers and claims against third parties for services rendered.
Accounts receivable from Funders consist of claims from Funders for grants pledged in accordance with the terms specified by the Funder. It also pertains to claims for expenses paid on behalf of projects more than cash received from Funders.
b) Revenue recognition
Recognition
Grant revenue
Most of the revenue is derived through restricted grants.
 Unrestricted grants: receivables from unrestricted grants are recognized in full in the period specified by the Funder.
Restricted grants are those that are received from a transfer of resources, including Window 1 funds transferred from the CGIAR Trust Fund, in return for past or future compliance with specific conditions. These grants are recognized as revenue once there is reasonable assurance that the System Organization has complied with the funders conditions. Restricted grants are recognized as revenue to the extent of expenses for that grant are incurred.
 Restricted grants: receivables from restricted grants are recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract.
 Receivables from employees are recognized as they arise and settled when payment is received.
 Advances to CGIAR Centers are recognized when the cash or other assets are delivered to the Center or when a payment is made to settle a Centers liability.
Grants revenues are segregated into:
 Restricted Portfolio: Window 1 funds received from CGIAR Research Programs or Platforms that is recognized as revenue only as expenses are incurred in support of the specific activities supported by the CGIAR Research Programs or Platform.
 Restricted Non-portfolio: Window 1 funds received from the CGIAR Trust Fund that is recognized as revenue only as expenses are incurred in support of the operations of the System Organization.
 Other receivables are recognized upon the occurrence of an event or transaction which gives the System Organization a legal claim against others.
e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are valued at acquisition cost, net of the corresponding accumulated depreciation, and accumulated losses for impairment that:
 Are held by the System Organization for the delivery of its
mission;
Other revenue
 Are expected to be used for more than one year; and
Other revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Harvesting hope: Training 313 farmers on best practices for Nyota bean cultivation, pest management, and soil health in Kenya's sub-county The Nyota bean, introduced by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) in 2017, is transforming bean production in Kieni East Sub County, Nyeri County, Kenya. Known for its drought tolerance, early maturity, and high yield, the Nyota bean has become popular among farmers. A recent training session organized by KALRO and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT through the Pan-Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) educated 313 farmers on best practices for Nyota bean cultivation, pest management, and soil health. The training also covered business skills, market access, value addition, and financial literacy. Farmers shared success stories, highlighting the economic benefits and improved food security brought by Nyota beans. The initiative aims to increase Nyota bean production and establish Kieni East as a major hub for high-quality bean production URL: https://www.pabra-africa.org/harvesting-hope-how-nyota-bean-is-transforming-kenyas-sub-county/

Nyota translated as star in Kiswahili was introduced by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) into the market in May 2017. Just like in other parts of Kenya, the variety has won the hearts of farmers in Kieni because it is climate smart (drought tolerant, early maturing, and disease tolerant); high yielding (producing up to 12 bags of 90kg per acre); has outstanding consumption traits (very low flatulence and sweet taste); and good for processing. To enhance the role of Nyota in Kienis bean value chain, a three-day training and experience sharing session was organized in the Naromoru/Kiamathaga and Kabaru wards from August 13 th to 15 th . The focus of this session was on Nyota production. The primary goal was to catalyse Nyota bean production across the county by educating farmers on best agricultural practices to ensure optimal cultivation techniques, pest management, and soil health to boost productivity. The training promoted behavioural change in commercial bean production and the bean corridor approach by sensitizing farmers to adopt improved farming practices and use quality inputs, including seeds. Recognizing that successful farming involves more than just cultivation, the training addressed business skills. Participants learned about market access, value addition, and post-harvest management. Furthermore, transforming the role of Nyota beans required financial literacy. Participants gained insights into budgeting, cost management, and income diversification related to Nyota bean production. A total of 313 farmers participated in various sessions, including 203 women and 110 men. Supported by the SeedEqual Initiative and organized by KALRO and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT through Pan-Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA), the event brought together a diverse group of participants, including farmers, ward extension officers, county agriculture representatives, 4K Club pupils, bean aggregators, off takers, input suppliers, and financial service providers. This broad representation constitutes the Nyota Multistakeholder Platform (MSP) in Kieni, underscoring the widespread interest in Nyota bean production, and highlighting the collaborative effort to boost its cultivation. Dr. David Karanja (standing) sensitizing farmers on Nyota bean production in Naromoru/Kiamathaga Ward  Photo by Priscilla Nzaka Kieni East, situated on the leeward side of Mount Kenya, faces many agricultural challenges. The regions dry, semi-arid climate and frequent floods make farming difficult. Additionally, unreliable rainfall and frost pose significant threats to food security. Despite these obstacles, Kieni East remains a strategic location for growing Nyota Beans. The varietys productivity is impressive in the county. For example, some farmers have reported yields of up to 50.5 kilograms per kilogram of seed planted. According to Dr. David Karanja National Bean Programme Leader at KALRO, Nyota Beans grown in Kieni East are of exceptional quality. This makes the area a priority for establishing a bean production hub, to service the local and regional distribution and consumption hubs. By focusing on this region, the project aims to increase both the quantity and quality of Nyota beans, offering a sustainable solution to food insecurity while securing business opportunities to farmers. During the experience sharing session, farmers gave compelling testimonies of how Nyota Beans have changed their lives. Matthew, a farmer and bean aggregator in Kiamathaga ward, shared his success story. With a smile, Matthew explained, Nyota Beans have really boosted my income. From just 72 kilograms of seeds, I managed to harvest 22 ninety kg bags (1.98 tons) of beans. The high yield and the strong market demand have made Nyota a valuable crop. Ruth Wanjiru, a Nyota bean farmer in Kabaru ward, explaining the economic benefits of Nyota bean farming  Photo by Priscilla Nzaka Ruth Wanjiru, a member of the Gitinga Youth Group and a Nyota bean farmer, has significantly benefited from her operation. She planted 2 kg of Nyota bean seed and harvested 75 kg. Despite this relatively modest yield, Ruth shared proudly, I paid my childs college school fees with money from Nyota. The success of Nyota Beans has provided Ruth with financial support, allowing her to manage her familys needs. She plans to expand her operation to planting 12-20 kg of seed in the future. As she noted, I used to struggle to make ends meet, but now I can pay school fees and take care of my familys needs comfortably. Gladys Wawera, a passionate Nyota Bean farmer, expressed how her perspective on farming has shifted. I used to plant and sell just for my daily needs, Gladys said. Nowadays, I plant to sell for profit. Her enthusiasm reflects a broader trend among farmers in the area, many of whom are now moving toward commercial bean farming and bean farming as a business. Gladys is not just increasing her income but also encouraging other farmers to adopt Nyota Beans for better yields and market opportunities. Nyota beans are not just a profitable crop; they are also highly nutritious and suitable for developing various bean value added products. As part of the training, participants sampled various bean-based products, including porridge and chapati made from bean flour. These products are nutritious and have a low flatulence level, making them suitable for all age groups. Because of its high iron and zinc, Nyota has been promoted for school feeding through the home grown and school gardening approach in local schools. Harriet Kinyua, the headteacher of Gitero School, shared how Nyota Beans have improved the school feeding program. The school planted just two kilograms of Nyota beans on a small plot and harvested 94 kilograms. This harvest was enough to provide three bean meals a week for all 430 students. Harriet noted, During the week we fed the children with Nyota Beans, none of them complained about stomach issues. Furthermore, parents who grow Nyota Beans have found it easier to pay school fees, reducing the number of children sent home for lack of payment. Nyota Beans have brought relief to our school and our community, Harriet added. With parents able to pay fees, we have fewer children being sent home. Sensory evaluation of Nyota beans and bean-flour-based foods (uji and chapati) at Gitero School  Photo by priscilla Nzaka The training has inspired optimism among farmers and other stakeholders. With improved agricultural practices and secure market linkages, farmers are ready to increase their productivity. Partnerships with off takers like Delish and Nutri ensure that farmers have a guaranteed market and fair prices. The Equity Group Foundation offers access to financial credit, empowering farmers to expand their operations. The goal is clear: to produce 30 tons of quality Nyota grain in the next two to three seasons. This aligns with the broader objective of PABRA and KALRO to increase the adoption of High-Iron Beans (HIB), which currently accounts for 12% of bean production, with a target to reach 40% by 2030. As Kieni East moves toward becoming a major hub for Nyota Bean production, the future looks promising. This small bean is not only feeding families but also building brighter futures, one harvest at a time. Other links Results The Promise of Beans About PABRA PABRA is all about beans. We believe that beans can improve the food security, income and health of smallholder farmers and urban dwellers across Africa, as well as contribute to improved soil fertility. We also believe that by increasing the competitiveness of bean markets, we can provide consumers with better products and contribute to the economic growth of our member countries. We work with more than 350 partners and members across 30 countries to do just that. Together, we deliver better beans for Africa. Recent Tweets Connect With Us PABRA, P.O.

As of October 2024, the eight farmer groups had a total membership of 692 households, an increase from 127 households in October 2023. Among these, 208 households were represented by women, while 484 were represented by men. These groups have proven effective in promoting and implementing technical innovations and served as role models for other livestock farmers in their communities. One thousand seven hundred (1,700) farmers have attended the groups information sharing sessions in the eight key villages where these groups operate. More than 900 farmers engaged in an online Zalo platform, which the farmer groups utilized to deliver training materials on SAPLING s innovations and to provide ongoing support for farmers via the platform. The groups also established eight livestock demonstration farms serving as hands-on learning resources for both members and non-members. With the support of the farmer groups, 692 smallholder households have been recorded as adopting at least one of SAPLING s innovations (i.e., AI, feeds and forages, or animal health), benefiting approximately 3,321 farmers when factoring in an average household size of 4.8 persons.

This assistance encompasses facilitating access to input and output markets, offering a platform for skill development, and collaboratively developing solutions for challenges related to pig and cattle farming. One of SAPLING s goals for these farmer groups is to enhance their capacity to adopt and scale up technical innovations introduced by the work package 1 with regards to genetics, feeds and forages and animal health. To assess this capability, SAPLING held an extent of adoption competition among the eight groups in September-October, evaluating their performance based on two criteria: membership size and the number of technical adopters. As the competition aimed to evaluate the leadership role of the farmer groups, local authorities and SAPLING were not directly involved in the activity. The farmer groups led in supporting farmers in villages with the adoption of SAPLING s innovations, with the initiative team providing backup assistance. The farmer groups used monthly village meetings to share information about these innovations and identified farmers interested in joining the groups or adopting the innovations. The groups then guided and monitored the adoption process, keeping track of the number of adopters to report to the judging panel. The competition was organized in close collaboration with local authorities, including the Mai Son District Agricultural Service Center, people s committees and farmers associations from four core communes (Chieng Luong, Chieng Chung, Hat Lot and Muong Bon), who served as the judging panel to verify the results. Additionally, the Community-Based Organic Agriculture Center (COAC), in collaboration with CPART a private company specializing in probiotics products (worth $2000), contributed 1,000 packs of probiotics to the eight farmer groups participating in the competition to help enhance production efficiency and reduce costs. This donation is part of their program called The community collaborates to assist 10,000 small-scale farmers in implementing circular agriculture practices and protecting the environment After one month, the competition noted remarkable outcomes. Membership in the eight farmer groups increased substantially from 127 members in October 2023 to 692 members in October 2024, including 30% females and 70% males. Nearly 900 farmers participated in an online Zalo platform, which the groups used to share training materials on SAPLING s innovations and offer continuous support. Overall, 692 households have been recorded as adopting at least one of SAPLING s innovations, benefiting approximately 3,321 farmers when factoring in an average household size of 4.8 people. Details can be found in the table below: Table 1: Cumulative number of farmer group s members and farmers adopting SAPLING s core innovations The project s interventions are being effectively implemented by members of livestock farmer groups. Although the competition serves as a minor incentive, it has showcased the internal capabilities of these groups to grow in size and encourage more farmers to embrace innovative livestock farming practices. This model should be advocated and scaled up to help smallholder farmers improve their livelihoods through livestock, said Thanh Lo, SAPLING s field coordinator. With SAPLING project concluding in 2024, a primary concern is the sustainability of the farmer groups once the project ends. However, this competition has shown that these groups can operate effectively on their own, particularly with support from local authorities. SAPLING is one of 32 CGIAR initiatives designed to achieve a world with sustainable and resilient food, land, and water systems. Its goal is to deliver more diverse, healthy, safe, sufficient, and affordable diets and ensure improved livelihoods and greater social equality within planetary and regional environmental boundaries. In Vietnam, one of its seven focus countries (others are Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Nepal, Tanzania, and Uganda), the initiative is coordinated by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT.

This work was conducted as part of the CGIAR Initiative on Sustainable Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender Inclusion (SAPLING). CGIAR research is supported by contributions to the CGIAR Trust Fund. CGIAR is a global research partnership for a food-secure future dedicated to transforming food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis.
Outcome  
The CGIAR Initiative on Sustainable Animal Productivity (SAPLING) has supported eight livestock farmer groups in Mai Son District, Son La Province, Vietnam, since 2023 as part of efforts to transform the region’s livestock sector. As of October 2024, the eight farmer groups had a total membership of 692 households, an increase from 127 households in October 2023. Among these, 208 households were represented by women, while 484 were represented by men. These groups have proven effective in promoting and implementing technical innovations and served as role models for other livestock farmers in their communities. One thousand seven hundred (1,700) farmers have attended the groups’ information sharing sessions in the eight key villages where these groups operate. More than 900 farmers engaged in an online Zalo platform, which the farmer groups utilized to deliver training materials on SAPLING’s innovations and to provide ongoing support for farmers via the platform. The groups also established eight livestock demonstration farms serving as hands-on learning resources for both members and non-members. With the support of the farmer groups, 692 smallholder households have been recorded as adopting at least one of SAPLING’s innovations (i.e., AI, feeds and forages, or animal health), benefiting approximately 3,321 farmers when factoring in an average household size of 4.8 persons.
The farmer groups have effectively enhanced smallholder farmers' access to both input and output markets. Regarding input markets, these eight groups formed direct partnerships with a probiotic product manufacturer (CPART Joint Stock Company) to purchase probiotics used to improve production efficiency and reduce costs in livestock farming. Consequently, they were offered a 30% discount off the usual retail price for probiotics, along with warranty coverage and additional benefits such as access to new products and participation in various programs. As of October 2024, the eight groups ordered 500 packs of probiotics for their members and received a donation of 1,000 packs (worth USD 2,000) through the manufacturer's development program.
With regards to output markets, the farmer groups have been encountering challenges in selling their livestock, primarily due to African Swine fever outbreaks affecting pigs and the halt of cross-border cattle trade to China, Vietnam's main market for cattle. To tackle this problem, a Livestock Production and Trade Alliance was formed and facilitated by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development under the Mai Son District People’s Committee and the SAPLING project to collaborate on the production, purchasing, and selling of livestock in Mai Son District and nearby areas.
The farmer group model created by SAPLING has been recognized for its effectiveness and is now integrated into the National Target Program (NTP) in Mai Son District in Phase I (2021-2025). The NTP,
valued at USD 760,000, aims to establish and support 19 new farmer groups across 6 community projects in the district, benefiting 495 farming households, to enhance cattle and horse production. SAPLING has helped create a detailed implementation work plan and provided training for 6 communes on writing community project proposals that comply with the regulations of Son La Province and the NTP. Moreover, a manual for establishing and maintaining farmer groups was collaboratively created by SAPLING and the Mai Son District’ Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for use in the program.
Partners
An experienced independent consultant was engaged to create a comprehensive strategy for the formation and management of farmer groups. National research institutions, including the National Institute of Animal Science (NIAS), the National Institute of Veterinary Research (NIVR), the Northern Mountainous Agriculture and Forestry Science Institute (NOMAFSI), offered technical support to help these groups to implement SAPLING innovations.
Local government entities, including the Sub-Department of Animal Health, Husbandry, and Fishery of Son La Province, the Mai Son District people’s committee, the District Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the District Agricultural Service Centre, and the Communal People’s Committee in the four key communes (Chieng
Luong, Chieng Chung, Hat Lot, Muong Bon) played a crucial role in coordinating events to raise awareness of farmer groups within the community and to integrate this farmer group model into the NTP.
Why did we do this research?
SAPLING in Vietnam is being implemented from 2022 to 2024 with the goal of improving the pig and cattle value chains in the Northwest Highlands. To address issues related to low productivity, the initiative provides farmers with technical innovations in breeding, feeds and forages, and animal health. The aim is for over 5,000 producers in each targeted value chain to adopt these innovations.
Farmer organizations, which can take various forms such as interest groups, clubs, or cooperatives, have been found to positively influence smallholder agriculture. These groups assist members in achieving their personal and collective goals by improving communication, enhancing skills and knowledge, and increasing access to markets and services (Markelova and Mwangi 2010; Vu et al. 2020). Therefore, a key element of SAPLING's overall strategy to enhance the pig and cattle value chains involves the establishment and support of farmer groups for improved access of the farmers to input and output markets, as well as being a forum for capacity development and co- creating of solutions to issues pertaining to pig and cattle keeping.
Since March 2023, SAPLING has been assisting eight farmer groups across four key communes (Chieng Luong, Chieng Chung, Hat Lot, and Muong Bon) in the Mai Son District of Son La Province. The support is centred on three primary areas: (i) improving the functionality of the farmer groups, (ii) increasing their presence within the local communities, and (iii) involving them in local policies and programs, the NTP in particular, to achieve a broader impact.
Evidence
1. Farmer group memberships and number of technical adopters
SAPLING developed a monitoring framework to oversee the activities of the farmer groups, focusing on metrics such as membership and the implementation of technical innovation. Additionally, in September and October 2024, SAPLING held an ‘extent of adoption’ competition among the eight groups, evaluating their leadership skills based on membership size and the number of adopters. Accordingly, households interested in joining a group must fill out a registration form for the group's management board. Households implementing specific technical innovations must submit evidence, such as photos or videos, showing their application process on the group's Zalo platform. The management boards of the groups compiled a list of members and the number of adopters based on this information, which was then verified and endorsed in partnership with the Mai Son District’s Agricultural Service Centre and the people’s committees in the four key communes where the FGs are active and managed. (See Annex 1 – Farmer groups’ monitoring form, Annex 2 - Examples of photos/videos evidencing the adoption of technical innovations posted on the farmer groups’ Zalo accounts, and Annex 3 - Example of a recording form verified by the communal people’s committee).
As of October 2024, the eight farmer groups had a total of 692 households as members, a rise from 127 households in October 2023. Out of these, 208 households were represented by women and 484 by men. Each household implemented at least one of SAPLING's innovations (i.e., AI, feeds and forages, or animal health), positively impacting around 3,321 people, based on an average household size of 4.8 people (Table 1)

Note:
- Feeds and forages innovations include improved forage varieties, silage preparation, urea-treated rice straw, feeding regime for cattle/pigs

Animal health innovations include biosecurity, vaccination, biological bedding preparation
2. Connecting farmer groups with input and output markets
To assist farmer groups in adopting innovations, SAPLING not only offered training but also identified local providers of essential products and services. For instance, SAPLING researched the market to locate a top supplier of probiotics, specifically CPART Joint Stock Company, and connected farmers to ensure they could obtain quality products at competitive prices. Accordingly, the farmer groups were provided a 30% discount on probiotics, along with warranty coverage and other benefits, including access to new products and participation in various programs (Le et al. 2023). As of October 2024, the eight groups ordered 500 packs of probiotics for their members Moreover, during the farmer group competition held in September and October, these groups received a donation of 1,000 packs (worth USD 2,000) from a program called ‘The community collaborates to assist 10,000 small-scale farmers in implementing circular agriculture practices and protecting the environment’ led by the Community-Based Organic Agriculture Center (COAC), in collaboration with CPART (See Thinh 2024b for more details on the donation and its value).
To support farmer groups in better connecting to markets, SAPLING in partnership with the Mai Son District People’s Committee, organized a livestock trade promotion workshop on 28 November 2024. This workshop brought together 80 participants representing local authorities, livestock farmer groups/cooperatives, livestock traders, slaughterhouses, processors and retailers in Mai Son District. Finally, a Livestock Production and Trade Alliance has been established and coordinated by the Department of Agricultural and Rural Development and the SAPLING project. Its main tasks include:
Inventorying livestock resource areas and livestock numbers throughout the district.
o Setting goals for linking livestock production with market units.
o Sharing information on buyers who want to purchase or process products from local livestock resources (cattle, pigs, horses).
o Developing an action plan with a time frame and performance evaluations.
Informing participants about price trends, buyers, and production needs for products (cattle, pigs, etc.).
o Providing livestock care methods to local households.
o Promoting market thinking to replace the savings mindset of livestock farming.
o Assisting local enterprises and cooperatives in meeting policy requirements and government audits, thereby promoting local consumption.
As a pilot, monthly updates and newsletters will be provided to the alliance members, offering the latest information on market trends and consumption needs (Thinh 2024c)
3. Supporting implementation of the National Target Program in Mai Son District
Regarding the engagement of SAPLING into the NTP of Mai Son District, on 14 August 2024, the Mai Son District people's committee reached out to the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT, and the SAPLING project, acknowledging their contributions and requesting additional assistance. The requests included improving livestock value chains, providing technical training for farmers, implementing QR codes for livestock management, supporting community groups in selling products, and organizing workshops to share experiences with other regions (Thinh 2024a)
On 9 September2024, the Mai Son District people's committee issued Decision No. 1969/QD-UBND, forming a working group to guide and assist in the development and execution of community production projects under the NTP for socio-economic development in ethnic minority and mountainous areas for the 2021–2025 period in Mai Son District. This was followed by the establishment of a project proposal council along with its operational regulations. In these documents, SAPLING was designated to support the development and completion of project implementation documents, provide reference materials for forming and managing farmer groups involved in community projects, and offer technical consulting on livestock management and product marketing for livestock households (See Annex 4 for more details on the Decision).
SAPLING has provided support in developing a detailed implementation work plan and conducting training sessions for 6 communes to write community production project proposals that complied with Son La Province and NTP regulations (Thinh, 2024a). Additionally, SAPLING collaborated with the District Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to develop a manual for establishing and sustaining farmer groups for the program (Mai Son Agriculture Division, 2024). These efforts aim to help the Mai Son District people’s committee fulfill the NTP’s goal of establishing and supporting 19 new farmer groups across 6 community production projects by the end of 2024, benefiting 495 farming households and improving cattle and horse production (Nghia et al.
2024).
Next steps
o Maintain assistance for the eight SAPLING farmer groups in linking to input and output markets, while progressively enabling these groups to operate independently.
o Support the 19 newly established farmer groups under the NTP to operate effectively.
o Provide ongoing technical backstopping for all farmer groups to effectively adopt SAPLING’s core innovations.
o Provide training materials on SAPLING’s technical innovations and farmer group model to the local government for replication and scaling in other areas under the NTP outside the project intervention area.

An international 3-day conference held in Harare in August 2024, proposed to examine agroecology as a solution to climate change-related disasters. The CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology, led in Zimbabwe by CIMMYT, participated actively in the conference, through a panel discussion, leadership in breakaway sessions, and farmer participation in a marketplace. Agroecology approaches to recover from El-Nino in Zimbabwe From CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology Published on 30.09.24 Impact Area Environmental health & biodiversity Share this to : Key messages from a conference to advocate for a regional agroecology policy within the Southern African Development Community. Authors: Craig E. Murazhi, Dorcas Matangi, Taurai Zingwena, Telma Sibanda, Bolyne T. Chapeyama, Florida Benjamin, Chengetai Koza and Vimbayi G. P. Chimonyo. Worldwide the impacts of poor nutrition and food insecurity are devastating, and Southern Africa is no exception. Zimbabwe faces worsening food crisis due to El Ni o droughts. An international 3-day conference held in Harare in August 2024, proposed to examine agroecology as a solution to climate change-related disasters. The CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology, led in Zimbabwe by CIMMYT, participated actively in the conference, through a panel discussion, leadership in breakaway sessions, and farmer participation in a marketplace. Exploring agroecology solutions for Zimbabwe The event was an opportunity to reflect on the contributions of the CGIAR Agroecology Initiative in Zimbabwe to resolve the main challenges and opportunities discussed at the conference. Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies. The Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALL) communities adhere to the principle of farming in harmony with nature, participating in action research that includes tree planting for food and afforestation, integrating animals into the habitat, reducing the use of chemicals that pollute the environment and harm flora and fauna, and fostering diversity on farms to support food production and environmental recovery. Sustainable climate practices are explored such as mulching, minimum tillage and crop diversification. The sorghum value chain in Mbire was identified as an appropriate crop for the agroecological region because of the rainfall pattern as a climate change adaptation strategy which also addresses the issue of food insecurity and livelihood sustainability. Organic agriculture. ALL communities have prioritized studying with CIMMYT the effects of reducing inorganic inputs such as inorganic fertilizers, and pesticide chemicals, the use of push-pull technologies to repel and attract pests for pest control, and live and dead mulch for moisture retention and weed control, or the use of manure to reduce use of synthetic or inorganic fertilizers. Policy environment. Marked by contradictions, agroecology and commercial farming are both receiving support on paper, but in practice, budgets are predominantly allocated to commercial agriculture. Zimbabwe is implementing an Agroecology Promotion Policy and Strategy for 2024-2030 . The Initiative team is part of a working group that addresses agroecology issues, including advocating for the advancement of Zimbabwe s agroecology strategy. Market systems for farmers in agroecology. The team has taken a needs-based approach introducing Sasso chickens in Murehwa and developing the sorghum value chain in Mbire. This included farmers training with the support of our scaling partners, Hamara as a partner for the Sasso chicken business model and PHI Commodities for sorghum to enhance marketing strategies. Measuring the performance of agroecology. The conference was the opportunity for FAO to present the agroecology assessment framework TAPE, a comprehensive tool that aims to measure the multi-dimensional performance of agroecological systems across the different dimensions of sustainability. FAO acknowledged the complementarity of TAPE with the Holistic Localized Performance Assessment (HOLPA) developed by the CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology. The team is contributing to HOLPA with more than 200 household datasets. Indigenous knowledge. The Zimbabwe team has proactively aimed at integrating Indigenous knowledge in the co-created solutions within ALLs with positive responses from communities who are testing particularly solutions for pest management, such as the use of ash and plants like chili for pest control, and animal waste as manure. Capacity building. Seen as a lever for communities to adopt agroecology, the team is integrating training into all aspects of initiative implementation, and fomenting knowledge exchange through seed networks, fairs, and farmer dialogues. The Initiative has hosted two seed and livestock fairs in Murehwa and Mbire which are among some of the biggest events in AE in the country. Gender Equality and Social Inclusion. Women and youth have been trained in the ALLs and encouraged to participate and tap into the community s knowledge. Through Dialogue with Elders, this knowledge of food and farming systems, as well as the prevention of human-wildlife conflict, has been integrated into AE research. Mechanization technologies have been introduced to enable youth to love and adopt agroecology and the machinery is gender friendly to allow use by all. Work in partnership to accelerate agroecology transformations. Employing a partner-led, bottom-up approach to scale agroecology effectively, the Initiative has teamed up in Zimbabwe with a range of partners (IWMI, APT, Hamara Farmer, PHI, BioHubTrust, and Agritex) to support scaling efforts. Farmers, who are central during the action research, play a vital role in this bottom-up approach. They do not only contribute to the initiative but also educate other farmers outside the project, thus fostering broader adoption and adaptation of agroecological practices. Additionally, the Initiative is involved in an agroecology working group that explores various applications of agroecology in the country. Other partners, such as Kurima, Mahindra, and Zimplow, contribute to our mechanization efforts. Conference recommendations The conference called upon the African Union (AU) to sustain agroecology advocacy. It was recommended to formulate linkages with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Committee on Agriculture and Climate Change, and to allocate sufficient resources to agroecology initiatives at the country level. Investments in research, innovation, and evidence-gathering should emphasize farmer-led research. The continuous sharing of successful practices and technologies across regions was considered fundamental to promoting agroecology solutions.

[INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","UNDP and IWMI launch joint initiative for Circular Economy in coffee and rice value chains The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) launched a joint initiative to assist smallholder farmers and small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the provinces of Can Tho, Dak Lak, and Son La to adopt circular economy models for the coffee and rice value chains. As part of that, a series of capacity building workshops targeting farmers, extension agents and other relevant stakeholders have been organized. The UNDP-IWMI collaboration supported by the initiative on Nature-Positive Solutions highlights the importance of partnerships in achieving sustainable development.  https://www.undp.org/vietnam/press-releases/joint-initiative-upgrade-agricultural-circular-businesses-viet-nam:
Joint initiative to upgrade agricultural circular businesses in Viet Nam March 27, 2024 Coffee and rice farmers and entrepreneurs will pilot ways to reduce waste and emissions that create job opportunities. Ha Noi, 27 March 2024 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) announced a joint initiative to assist smallholder farmers and small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the provinces of Can Tho, Dak Lak, and Son La to adopt circular economy models for the coffee and rice value chains. These models are expected to positively impact the agricultural ecology, enhance economic value and improve livelihoods for local communities. In Viet Nam, rice production is responsible for 19 percent of the country s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (NDC, 2022). These emissions stem from various factors such as deforestation, intensive use of fertilisers and water for irrigation, and mismanagement of by-products like straws and husks. Similarly, coffee plantations pose significant risks of direct and indirect deforestation. To address these issues, a circular economy approach mitigates negative effects on agricultural ecosystems and improve economic performance. The collaboration will identify and disseminate circular solutions associated with rural and peri-urban waste in selected sites through hands-on capacity-building workshops for 200 farmers groups. Additionally, two business models will be selected to pilot circular solutions to identified bottlenecks. Technical advisory support is expected to make these models more economically feasible, resource-efficient, and climate-smart. Underpinning these activities, the Viet Nam Circular Economy Hub will host the final sharing and learning workshop to disseminate improved business models for replication in other provinces and promote lessons learnt by facilitating the connection of stakeholders, including governmental agencies, private sectors and associations, academia, and development partners. According to Ms. Ramla Khalidi, UNDP Resident Representative in Viet Nam, There is great potential in applying circular economy principles in the agriculture sector. Application of circularity will help to reduce costs, enhance sustainability, and improve the competitiveness of Viet Nam s agricultural products, while simultaneously reducing waste, mitigating the negative impacts on the environment, and offering effective response to climate change. Dr. Mark Smith, Director General at IWMI, emphasized, Our overarching goal is to ensure that biocircular solutions are used more effectively to generate increased economic, environmental, and social benefits that can help farming households and SMEs in rural and urban areas and contribute to GHG emission reduction. The UNDP-IWMI collaboration highlights the importance of partnerships in achieving sustainable development. The two organisations aim to accelerate the transition towards resilient and nature-positive agrifood systems by pooling their expertise and resources. This work is also made possible by the CGIAR Initiative on Nature-Positive Solutions (Nature+).

Workshop Report
1. Background
South Asia's seed systems are characterized by both formal and informal networks. The formal seed system, which includes government agencies and private companies, produces and distributes certified seeds in line with the regulatory system of the country. However, this system is often inadequate in serving the needs of women and smallholder farmers, who may lack the resources, information, or access required to obtain seeds through formal channels. Distribution networks in the formal system frequently struggle to reach remote or marginalized communities, and women. In contrast, informal seed systems thrive at the community level, with farmers engaging in traditional practices of saving, exchanging, and sharing seeds. The informal networks play a crucial role in preserving locally adapted crop varieties and provide women with greater access to seeds of preferred varieties. Moreover, they offer women opportunities to actively participate in seed production and exchange in their communities.
Since neither of these systems alone can cater to the seed needs of all smallholder farmers, they need to co-exist. There is significant merit in forging connections between them to develop robust and decentralized seed systems. These connections can blend the quality assurance and innovation of formal seed networks with the accessibility and local adaptation of informal systems. This approach could improve access to quality seeds for women and other unreached groups.
2. CGIAR Initiative on Seed Equal
CGIAR Seed Equal initiative is dedicated to enhancing access to high-quality seeds of market-preferred, climate- resilient, and nutritious crop varieties for women and marginalized communities, with the goal of accelerating genetic gain on their farms. Work Package 6 (WP 6) of Seed Equal focuses on developing strategies to improve seed access for women, youth, and other marginalized farmers. This includes research for development efforts that foster synergies between formal and informal seed systems, support seed entrepreneurship, and implement gender-responsive seed information and delivery pathways.
3. Objectives of the workshop
Held over two days from 4–5 June, 2024, in Kathmandu, Nepal, the workshop on “Synergies between formal and informal seed systems” brought together a diverse set of stakeholders representing policymakers, researchers, and grassroots organizations from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. A detailed list of participants is provided in Annexure 1.
The objectives of the workshop were to:
▪ Facilitate cross-sectoral knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders of seed systems in South Asia to address challenges related to gender disparities in seed access, coordination, and marginalization of smallholder farmers within formal and informal seed systems.
▪ Identify potential synergies and opportunities for collaboration between formal and informal seed systems, to enhance seed access and equity.

Refer to Annexure 2 for the workshop concept note and Annexure 3 for the workshop agenda.
4. Workshop process
The workshop commenced with a welcome note, followed by an introduction of the participants facilitated by Ms. Afreen Khan, Assistant Scientist, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Dr. Ranjitha Puskur, Principal Scientist and Lead of WP 6 at IRRI, presented an overview of the Seed Equal Initiative, detailing its vision and objectives. She highlighted WP 6’s goal of promoting access to quality seeds of preferred crop varieties for women and marginalized farmers to enhance their agricultural productivity and incomes.
The keynote address delivered by Dr Anjani Kumar, Senior Research Fellow, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), highlighted the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of various seed distribution channels, including government networks, private players, and farmer-to-farmer systems. He stressed the importance of harmonizing seed sector development with global trade, strengthening the seed industry through policy support and private sector engagement, and attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to drive innovation and competitiveness.

Presentations by representatives from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka provided insights into the landscape of seed systems and the intersection between formal and informal sectors in their respective countries. In India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan, seed policies generally support synergies between formal and informal sectors. However, in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, formal seed systems dominate, with limited legal recognition of farmer-managed systems. The discussions highlighted the scant literature on seed systems in Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan, and the urgent need for more research in these countries to better understand and support their seed systems.
Structured group discussions and an open forum highlighted the challenges and actionable strategies for catalyzing synergies between the formal and informal seed systems. The workshop concluded with a summary of key insights and strategies to enhance seed access and equity, including the impact of policies on coordination and collaboration between formal and informal seed systems.
Subsequent sections in this report describe the key themes that emerged through these interactions, with a dedicated discussion on the complex interplay between formal and informal seed systems in the South Asian countries.
4.1 Do we need both formal and informal seed systems?
The workshop highlighted the myriad challenges women and marginalized farmers face in accessing new varieties and seeds, including inadequate extension services, and inequitable dissemination of agricultural information. This information gap limits their ability to adopt innovations and widens the divide between those who can engage with formal seed systems and those who cannot. The lack of access to new crop varieties, modern cultivation techniques, and market intelligence disproportionately affects marginalized farmers.

Financial constraints further exacerbate this limited access. Even when women own land, they often struggle to secure credit due to their small holdings. For instance, it was highlighted that smallholder farmers in Bhutan have faced increased difficulties in securing loans, as banks have become more cautious in lending since the COVID-19 pandemic. Without access to finance, these farmers cannot invest in quality seeds or other critical agri-inputs, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and vulnerability.
Participants discussed the lack of support systems and safety nets which leave farmers vulnerable to risks such as crop failures, market fluctuations, and climate change impacts. One participant remarked, ""Relying on a single system for seed supply is fraught with risks, especially for those without a safety net."" The absence of alternatives can be particularly concerning for women and smallholder farmers, who often lack the resources to recover from setbacks. The informal seed sector, which is more attuned to local needs and offers greater crop diversity, struggles with challenges related to seed quality and limited access to genetic improvement. As one participant summarized, ""Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages, but neither can individually meet the needs of women and marginalized farmers.""
4.2 Should formal and informal seed systems work together?
Formal seed systems involve structured and regulated processes governed by public and private institutions, including research & development (R&D), certification, and distribution of seed. Informal seed systems, on the other hand, rely on traditional practices where farmers save, exchange, and sell seeds without formal regulatory oversight. Each system has its strengths and weaknesses and no one system is perfect or can cater to the quality seed needs of all farmers. Leveraging the strengths of both is critical to enhance the diversity and quality of and accessibility to seed, and consequently agricultural productivity.

▪ Coordination between formal and informal systems is crucial to expand the range of crops and varieties available to farmers, facilitate the introduction of new genetic material, and promote agrobiodiversity. This is essential for adapting to changing environmental conditions and ensuring food security through diverse and resilient crop and variety options.
▪ These interactions could improve access to information and enable farmers to make informed decisions about seed quality, availability, and best practices. For instance, when formal systems hold field demonstrations on farmers' fields, the information often spreads among fellow farmers. This informal knowledge sharing allows a broader group of smallholders to learn about new varieties and modern agricultural techniques.
▪ By cooperating, formal and informal systems can ensure that farmers have timely and affordable access to quality seeds.
▪ Integrating scientific knowledge, infrastructure, and R&D from formal systems into informal networks can lead to significant advancements in seed quality and production techniques, benefiting the broader agricultural community.
4.3 Do formal and informal seed sectors interact now?
Participants reflected on how formal and informal seed sectors interact in their countries and highlighted that current interactions are often limited, sporadic, and unstructured. This lack of intentional collaboration results in missed opportunities that could benefit both sectors. The highlights of these discussions are as follows:
▪ Extractive practices and lack of benefit-sharing
The formal sector often sources genetic material such as landraces from the informal sector, including community seed banks or individual farmers. However, these interactions are typically extractive, with little to no benefit-sharing mechanisms in place. For example, in Bhutan, the formal seed sector has used local landraces for research and breeding without adequately compensating or rewarding the communities that have conserved these genetic resources for generations. This practice undermines trust and fails to support the sustainability of informal seed systems.
▪ Synergistic mechanisms
Mechanisms such as truthful labeling (TL), participatory varietal selection (PVS), and the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act (PPVFRA) in India are designed to foster interaction between the formal and informal sectors, though they require further improvement and broader implementation. PVS, for example, involves farmers in selecting new varieties and building synergies between formal research institutions and farmer groups. However, these programs often do not reach their full potential due to limited scale and insufficient recognition of farmers' contributions.
▪ Farmer groups and community-based seed production
Farmer groups, producer organizations, and community-based seed production (CBSP) play the critical role of a bridge between the formal and informal sectors. These groups facilitate knowledge exchange, seed multiplication, and local distribution, contributing to the resilience of local seed systems. In Nepal and India, semi-formal initiatives like community seed banks (CSB) and CBSP have been instrumental in maintaining local crop diversity and providing seeds during shortages. However, they require greater formal recognition and support.
▪ Farmer representation in governance and decision-making
Farmers' representation in governance forums, variety release and selection bodies, and other decision- making processes is crucial to ensure that their needs and perspectives are considered in variety development and distribution. However, this inclusion is often limited. In India, while mechanisms like the PPVFRA exist to protect farmers' rights, there is a need for more inclusive representation in decision-making bodies to ensure that farmers' voices are adequately heard and their interests protected.

▪ Knowledge and technology exchange
The formal and informal seed sectors exchange knowledge and technologies. The formal sector, including research institutions, seed companies, and government agencies, often provides new germplasm, improved crop varieties, and early generation seed (EGS) to the informal sector. This interaction contributes to genetic diversity and the overall health of seed systems.
▪ Seed entrepreneurship
The formal seed sector’s efforts in marketing new varieties are crucial for providing farmers with diverse options. However, affordability and availability, particularly for marginalized groups such as smallholder farmers and women, can be a major constraint. The market-oriented seed production in the informal sector presents an opportunity to address this challenge. Farmer collectives and seed producer groups are increasingly involved in multiplying and marketing seeds, often sourcing foundation seed from the formal sector. This enhances seed availability, though success depends heavily on the support and resources provided by the formal sector, including technology and infrastructure.
The current interaction between formal and informal seed sectors presents both opportunities for and challenges to inclusive access to seeds. While there is knowledge transfer and value chain linkages, there are significant barriers to farmer representation in governance and equitable access to resources.
4.4 Challenges in promoting collaboration and coordination between formal and informal sectors
Enhancing collaboration and coordination between the formal and informal sectors is vital, with seed producers acting as a critical bridge between the two. Seed producers not only play a key role in meeting local seed demands and preserving genetic diversity but also have the potential to serve as intermediaries for effective coordination that benefits both the sectors. Table 1 outlines the major challenges that seed producers in the informal sector face, as shared by the workshop participants.

crop failure, pests, and climate-related events.
Regulatory barriers
Strict seed certification, high registration fees, and complex licensing make it expensive for informal producers to enter the market or expand their business. Labeling and packaging regulations add further challenges due to limited resources or infrastructure.
Informal seed producers are excluded from larger, formal markets, limiting their ability to grow and compete. This restricts innovation and hampers the overall development of the seed sector, particularly in rural and underserved areas where informal producers play a key role.
Limited data on informal sector activities
The limited data on the informal seed sector’s activities creates a blind spot for policymakers and researchers, making it difficult to fully understand the sector's needs, challenges, and contributions.
This hinders the design and implementation of targeted support strategies, such as capacity-building programs, financial assistance, or regulatory frameworks.
Extractive practices
The formal seed sector uses landraces from informal networks without offering equitable compensation or recognition.
This practice undermines local farmers' contributions, damages trust between formal and informal sectors, discourages collaboration, and risks the loss of biodiversity and traditional knowledge.
The complex legal requirements of the formal seed sector were also identified as a significant challenge for women and marginalized farmers. The lack of enabling policies that address the specific needs of marginalized groups adds to the difficulty faced by the exclusion of those who are most in need of support from accessing the resources and opportunities available within the formal sector. Low levels of education and literacy among women and marginalized farmers prevent them from navigating the complex regulatory environment of formal seed systems.
4.5 Strategies to catalyze synergies through coordinated formal and informal seed systems in South Asia
The workshop discussed proven practical and actionable strategies to strengthen collaboration and coordination between formal and informal seed systems in different contexts. Table 2 summarizes the effective strategies and innovations that emerged.

This encourages greater engagement and collaboration from community- based groups, leading to stronger and more robust seed systems. This inclusive approach could ensure that diverse voices are heard and that these groups are actively involved in decision-making processes on variety selection, seed production practices, access, and benefit-sharing within seed systems. This can foster inclusive seed systems, boost women's economic empowerment, improve household nutrition, enhance community resilience, and promote sustainable practices leading to greater agricultural productivity and gender equity in farming communities. This will boost the credibility and marketability of seeds from the informal sector, helping farmers gain better market opportunities and recognition.

4.6 Conclusion and way forward
The workshop on “Synergies between formal and informal seed systems in South Asia,” highlighted the critical importance of bridging the gap between these two essential components of South Asia’s seed sector. The discussions highlighted a critical research and evidence gap in Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan, which limits our understanding of local challenges and opportunities. Addressing this gap is essential for developing evidence- based policies and interventions that can enhance seed security and support resilient agricultural systems.
By addressing the following key areas, South Asia can move towards a more integrated and resilient seed system, ultimately benefiting farmers, enhancing biodiversity, and contributing to sustainable agricultural development in the region.
• Tailored policy approaches: Countries with supportive policies should continue to strengthen synergies between formal and informal seed systems, fostering collaboration and innovation. In contrast, nations with dominant formal systems need to explore ways to integrate informal systems and recognize the role of farmers in seed conservation and development. Policies and programs must integrate a gender lens to ensure that both women and men benefit equally from these approaches and that gender-specific challenges and opportunities are addressed in the development and implementation of seed policies.
● Addressing research gaps: There is an urgent need for comprehensive research in Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan to better understand their seed systems. Collaborative research initiatives can provide critical insights and inform the development of more effective and inclusive seed policies.
● Regional collaboration: South Asian countries should leverage regional collaboration to share good practices, policy frameworks, and evidence. This collective effort can enhance the understanding and development of resilient seed systems across the region.
● Policy and practice implications: Policymakers in countries with limited synergies between formal and informal systems should consider the legal recognition of farmer-managed systems, capacity building for farmers, and participatory approaches in varietal development and seed multiplication. Researchers should focus on filling knowledge gaps and informing policy decisions to support more inclusive and resilient seed systems.

Abstract
Faced with incomplete and imperfect information, economic actors rely predominantly on perceptions and often base decisions on heuristics prone to bias. Gender bias in perceptions favoring men has been found in a wide variety of settings and may be an important reason why some sectors remain dominated by men and gender gaps persist. Using ratings of agro-input dealers provided by smallholder farmers in their vicinity, we test if farmers perceive male-managed agro-input shops differently than agro-input shops managed by women. After controlling for observable characteristics at the input dealer level and including fixed effects to account for farmer-level heterogeneity, we find that farmers rate male-managed agro-input outlets higher on a range of attributes related to the dealership in general, as well as when farmers are asked to consider the quality of inputs sold by the dealer. Our results suggest that consumers biased perceptions continue to be an important entry barrier for women in the subsector, and we conclude that policies and interventions designed to challenge gender norms and customs are needed to correct bias in perceptions.

Introduction
In the context of imperfect information, economic actors rely predominantly on perceptions and use mental shortcuts to make decisions using limited data (Kahneman, 2017). Reliance on instinct and emotions becomes dominant if it is difficult for economic actors to objectively assess the value of a commodity or service being bought and sold. However, perceptions and decision heuristics may suffer from a variety of cognitive biases such as stereotype thinking and availability bias, and may be influenced by social and cultural phenomena such as homophily effects and prevailing norms and customs.
Agricultural inputs such as inorganic fertilizers or improved seed varieties lie somewhere on the continuum between experience goods and credence goods. When farmers inspect goods at the agro-input shop, the quality can only be assessed superficially from readily observable characteristics such as homogeneity of the seed or by checking if the fertilizer package is intact. Even after the commodity has been used and yields can be observed, it may still be difficult for the farmer to learn about the quality of the input, as many other factors in addition to the input affect yield. As such, when farmers decide to acquire agricultural inputs or not, perceptions and emotions often take the upper hand.
take the upper hand.
In addition to the difficulty of judging quality of agricultural inputs, several studies note that there is considerable heterogeneity in the quality of inputs in the market. For instance, in Uganda, Bold et al. (2017) tested agricultural inputs purchased in local markets, and found that 30 percent of nutrient is missing in fertilizer, and hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain less than 50 percent authentic seeds. Also in Uganda, Ashour et al. (2019) tested herbicides and found that the average bottle in their sample was missing 15 percent of the active ingredient and 31 percent of samples contained less than 75 percent of the ingredient advertised. While it remains unclear if quality- related issues are due to deliberate adulteration or poor storage and handling, and at what point in the value chain quality starts to deteriorate, the resulting uncertainty makes reliance on perceptions and decision heuristics more likely (Barriga and Fiala, 2020).
In traditional societies with strong gender norms and customs, small businesses at different nodes along food supply chains are often one of the few options open to women to earn some money independently from their husband. While rapid urbanization has led to the emergence of fast-food restaurants, informal food vendors, who tend to be self-employed women, are still the main source of food for the majority of households (Giroux et al., 2021). And while supermarkets are emerging throughout the developing world, wet markets where mostly women sell produce continue to account for the majority of expenditure on fresh produce in many countries (Gorton, Sauer, and Supatpongkul, 2011). In Uganda, we find that a surprisingly large share of agro-input shops are operated and/or managed by women.
However, the same gender norms and customs may also mean that perceptions are stacked against women if
2
they venture into certain areas such as agro-input provision. Farmers, both male and female, may be of the opinion that modern agricultural technologies are in the male domain. Furthermore, agro-input shops primarily deal in seed for semi-commercial crops such as maize or rice, as opposed to food security crops such as beans or cassava. Again, commercial crops are often considered to be the responsibility of the men, while women are assumed to take care of the household food supply (Orr et al., 2016; Dolan, 2001). As a result, we conjecture that female-managed agro-input shops may be disadvantaged when farmers form opinions about the quality of services rendered or goods
sold.
In this paper, we test if farmers perceive agro-input shops managed by women less favorably than agro-input shops under male management using a unique dyadic dataset of farmer-dealer combinations. To operationalize perceptions, we asked farmers to rate agro-input dealers, on a scale of 1 to 5 on a range of characteristics. We then make between-dealer comparisons, accounting for observable differences in the quality of male- and female-managed shops. Furthermore, we use the fact that a farmer has generally rated more than one agro-input dealer. If the same farmer rates both male and female-managed agro-input shops, we can exploit this within-farmer variation and control for farmer specific observable and unobservable characteristics.
We find that farmers generally rate male-managed agro-input shops more favorably than agro-input shops managed by women. The difference in ratings is highest when farmers are asked to rate the agro-input dealership in terms of price competitiveness and in terms of reputation. We also find that seed from male-managed agro-input shops is rated higher than seed from shops managed by women. As the differences in ratings cannot immediately be explained by differences in the quality of the dealerships or the services and products they provide, we conclude that biased perceptions create an important disadvantage for female-managed agro-input shops.
In the remainder of this article, we first situate the research question in the wider literature. We then provide the context for the study and describe the main economic actors: agro-input dealers and smallholder maize farmers. We also describe how we measure perceptions, the key variable in this study. Next, we lay out the empirical strategy, followed by the results. A final section concludes and offers some policy guidance.
2 Research question and relation to the literature
We aim to test if gender equity biasbehavior that shows favoritism toward one gender over anotheris present in the way smallholder maize farmers in southwestern Uganda perceive agro-input dealers in their neighborhood. Gender equity bias has been confirmed in a wide range of contexts, usually when people are asked to assess the performance of another person. Stereotyping and role congruence are often catalysts for distorted perceptions and false beliefs about the abilities of particular groups of people. We highlight some of the most important studies that search for systematic bias related to the gender of the person being assessed.
One area where gender equity bias has been studied extensively is in scientific publishing using peer review. For
3
instance, Card et al. (2019) look at differences in rejection rates at four top economics journals. They compare male-authored papers to female-authored papers, using citations as a noisy measure of quality to account for potential sources of divergence between the two. They find that editors largely follow the referees, resulting in a 1.7 percentage point lower probability of a revise and re-submit verdict for papers with female authors relative to a citation-maximizing benchmark. However, evidence on gender biases in the evaluation of economic research remains mixed. For example, Chari and Goldsmith-Pinkham (2017) find no disparity in the acceptance rates of female- and male-authored papers for National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) conferences; Hospido and Sanz (2021) do find a significant advantage for male authors being accepted at three different European conferences. Gender equity bias has also been studied extensively in student evaluations of teaching. For instance, Mitchell and Martin (2018) find that the language students use in evaluations regarding male professors is significantly different than their language used in evaluating female professors. They also show that a male instructor administering an identical online course as a female instructor receives higher ordinal scores in teaching evaluations.
Gender equity bias is studied most in the context of peer review processes such as those mentioned above. However, the same perceptions surface when individuals decide on who to engage with, be it who to work with, who to elect as leaders, or who to consult. Labor markets and hiring decisions involve situations where managers decide based on limited information. Discrimination in labor markets, including discrimination related to gender, has been documented in several studies. Wu (2020) uses data from an online forum for economists called Economic Job Market Rumors to measure gender bias in discussions about women versus men. Gender equity bias is also often studied in the context of the wage gap, that is, when women appear to make substantially less money for the same work than their male counterparts. Often, this is also tied to gender equity bias in performance appraisals, where (often male) managers beliefs creep into their evaluations of workers (Correll et al., 2020).
Gender equity bias is also pervasive in politics. Pair et al. (2021) use natural language processing (NLP) to search for gender bias in Kenyas leading newspaper and sentiment analysis to predict quantitative sentiment scores for sentences surrounding female leader names compared to male leader names. They find evidence of improvement in gender equality but also a backlash from increased female representation in high-level governmental leadership. Le Barbanchon and Sauvagnat (2021) find that female candidates obtain fewer votes in municipalities with higher gender earnings gaps. Klein, Shtudiner, and Zwilling (2021) find that a financial advisors gender is one of the most important factors influencing a consumers choice of investment advisor. Female advisors gender was found to have a negative effect on the desire to invest, and this negative attitude was found to be significantly higher among male respondents.
respondents.
Gender bias features so prominently in areas such as scholarly peer review, teaching assessments, or labour markets partly because perceptions are made explicit in the process, for instance through review reports, student feedback, or hiring committees. However, in economic transactions, gender biases remain hidden as perceptions are

never measured. As a result, differences in outcomes are often attributed to various other causes, such as differences in education or ability between men and women.
3 Study Context
3.1 Sample
Our study area comprises 11 districts in southeastern Uganda, which roughly corresponds to the Busoga kingdom. We include agro-input dealers located in trading centers and villages as well as maize farmers that live in the catchment areas of these key market sheds. The dealer sample was obtained by listing all agro-input shops in the area during a census, which resulted in 348 dealers. We collected information on their characteristics in September and October 2020.
After the census, these agro-input shops were grouped in catchment areas based on their location. A catchment area is defined as the area that is served by a dealer, the area where this dealers customers live. If catchment areas of two or more dealers overlap because these dealers operate in the same town, street or right next to each other, they are assigned to the same catchment area. This is done on the basis of geographical location. Using GPS coordinates of the input dealers, the haversine function is used to construct an adjacency matrix, and shops that are less than 5 kilometer apart are assigned to the same catchment area. The 5 kilometer threshold was selected based on visual inspection of the map, the size of an average village and reported distance between farmers and dealers. The 348 agro-input dealers in Busoga were assigned to 130 catchment areas. In some catchment areas, there is a high density of shops, while in others there are only one or two dealers. On average, there are 2.7 dealers in an area, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 18.
In each catchment area, we also sampled farmers in proportion to the number of agro-input dealers in the area. We connected shops to villages by asking every dealer from which village most of his/her customers come from1. Enumerators were sent to these villages and instructed to randomly sample ten households that meet the inclusion criteria. Consequently, we sampled 3470 farmers and collected information about their characteristics in April 2021.
It is important to note that only farmers in half of the catchment areas rated dealers. This means that 1931 farmers rated 193 dealers in April 2021. To have a sufficient number, ratings were collected a second time in January and February 2022. While these ratings were provided by the same farmers, only 1893 of them were found during the second wave. These two rounds of surveys constitute the key sources of data for the study.
1If this village was already named by another dealer, the village with the second most customers was chosen. ?These ratings are part of the intervention of a different study, where a computer algorithm allocated the rating treatment randomly at the level of the catchment area.

3.2 Descriptive statistics
There is substantial heterogeneity among agro-input shops. Some are small informal shops located in rural areas, that sell other goods and only stock seed during the planting season. Others are located in towns or trading centers and specialize in farm inputs and tools. About 60 percent of the agro-input shop managers are male. The average shop has been in operation for about five years and serves about 40 customers a day, half of who come to buy maize seed. A shop stocks on average three maize seed varieties. Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics on the agro-input shops included in our study. More descriptive statistics describing seed handling and storage practices, efforts, and services of agro-input dealers, are presented in the appendix in Table 12.
The average farmer in our sample works on a small farm, with about 3.4 acres of land for crop production. Half of our sampled farmers indicate that they used improved maize seed on at least one plot in the season preceding the survey, and of the farmers that used improved seed, two-thirds obtained this seed from an agro-input shop. However, fertilizer use is very low. As a result, productivity is also low, with the average farmer harvesting only about 500 kg of maize per acre. Almost 70 percent of farmers are of the opinion that maize seed sold at the agro-input shop is counterfeit. Table 2 provides additional descriptive statistics of the farmers included in our study.

4 Measuring perceptions
Quantifying perceptions of the quality of services provided by agro-input dealers and of the products they sell improved maize seed varieties in particularis central to our analysis. To do so, we asked farmers to rate agro-input dealers in their catchment area on a range of attributes. We broadly categorized the attributes into two families of indicators. A first set of indicators attempts to measure overall quality of agro-input dealers and the services they provide, while a second set of indicators has a much more narrow focus and asks about a particular product sold by the agro-input dealer (maize seed). Note that as agro-input dealers are often clustered in towns and trading centers, farmers often rate several agro-input dealers.
To measure the perceived quality of agro-input dealers, farmers were asked to rate these dealers on a scale of 1 to 5 on their general quality, location (convenience, accessibility, closeness to clients), price (competitive pricing, discounts), seed quality, stock (availability of seed, number of varieties in stock), and reputation (what do other farmers think about the dealer). We also compute an average of these six dealer level ratings. For these indicators, farmers were asked to rate the shop as a whole, which also includes the person who operates the shop.3
To measure the perceived quality of seed, farmers were asked to rate the improved maize varieties that dealers sell on a scale of 1 to 5 on their general quality, yield, drought tolerance, pest/disease tolerance, crop dura- tion/maturation period, and germination reliability.4 We also compute an average of these six seed-level ratings. For these variables, farmers were asked to rate seed, the product itself. Farmers were also allowed to indicate that they could not rate seed on a particular dimension (for instance because they never bought seed from the agro-input
dealer).
We asked farmers to rate agro-input dealers twice, a first time in April 2021 and a second in January 2022. The average farmer in our dataset provided ratings for about two agro-input dealers, with some farmers rating up to 15 dealers. The average agro-input shop received ratings from almost 12 farmers, while one shop received ratings from almost 50 farmers. Table 3 provides descriptive statistics of the ratings used in our study.

3It may be that the shop is owned by a particular person, but the owner employs another person to manage the shop. This is especially the case for larger shops in towns. In villages and trading centers, the shop owner is generally also the manager. 4Some of these attributes are variety specific. For instance, some hybrid seeds may be particularly drought tolerant, while other seeds may be higher yielding. Therefore, we specifically asked farmers to rate varieties relative to what is advertised for these attributes.

5 Empirical Strategy
Our empirical strategy exploits the particular nature of the data, that is, that each farmer in our dataset rates several agro-input dealers (and each dealer is rated by several farmers). A useful starting point is the following specification:
yf,d =  + gd + f,d (1)
Here, ysq represents the rating, on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), given by farmer f to agro-input dealer d. ga is the main variable of interestthe gender of dealer d. a and { are parameters to be estimated, and ey q is a residual.
residual.
Because the same farmer may rate several agro-input dealers, we cannot assume that the ratings ys 4 in equation 1 are independent. For example, the ratings that a farmer provides may be affected by a (potentially unobservable) characteristic of the farmer (e.g., a poor experience with an agro-input dealer in a previous year), which may affect the ratings received by all agro-input dealer rated by this particular farmer. Furthermore, the same agro-input dealer may be rated by several farmers, leading to interdependence in the other dimension. For example, the ratings that an agro-input dealer receives may be affected by a (potentially unobservable) characteristic of the dealer (e.g., dealer friendliness), which may affect the ratings given by all farmers that rated this particular dealer. To account for this two-way interdependence in equation 1, we define a composite error term, ( sa) that can be decomposed into a farmer specific component (vy), an agro-input dealer specific component (wa), and a residual (,,q) that varies at the level of the farmer-dealer interaction.
f,d = f + d + f,d (2)
Equation 2 shows that the dyadic nature of our data leads to two-way clustering in the error term. As long as the error term is uncorrelated with the explanatory variable(s) included in equation 1, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) remains consistent. However, not taking into account within-cluster error correlation generally leads to standard errors that are biased downward, leading to under-rejection of the hypothesis that gender does not affect ratings. In our case, it should be noted that clustering is non-nested. As traditional cluster-robust inference can only deal with clustering in one of the dimensions, our strategy will consist of including sufficient regressors to minimize concerns about error correlation at the agro-input dealer level, and then cluster standard errors at farmer level (Cameron and Miller, 2015).
level (Cameron and Miller, 2015).
To test for an agro-input dealer gender effect, we can simply compare average ratings received by male-managed agro-input shops to average ratings received by female-managed agro-input shops. Equation 3 shows how this can
11
be done using a simple OLS regression on dealer-level averages.
ps a4 594 + a \\ awa + ph (3) f f f f f
yd =  + gd + d (4)
In equation 3, identification of the gender equity effect (3) relies on differences between agro-input dealers. As dealer gender is constant for all farmers that rate a particular dealer, the average gq is also a binary indicator of the gender of that particular dealer d. The farmer-specific component vy is absorbed in the intercept term p, while the dealer specific-component wg is now included in the error term =.
It is important to note that in equation 4, the error component pyWa in the error term q may be correlated with the independent variable gg. This would be the case if, for example, female agro-input shop managers are on average less educated than male agro-input shop managers, and less educated agro-input dealers are rated lower by farmers. In this case, differential ratings are not caused by gender in itself, but rather driven by differences in education. We will control for a range of agro-input dealer-level potential confounders by including them as additional regressors (xq) in equation 4:
yd =  + gd + xd + d
(5)
As we are interested in explaining gender equity bias in perceptions in different dimensions, the set of control variables used will also differ. For example, when farmers are asked to rate agro-input dealers in terms of price competitiveness, it seems reasonable to include prices charged by dealers as controls. Similarly, for perceptions related to the quality of seed sold, we are particularly interested in testing if the coefficient on the gender of the agro-input dealer changes after adjusting for various observable dealer characteristics that are directly related to quality, such as storage technology, infrastructure such as leak-proof roof or insulation, etc. In this way, we attempt to differentiate between situations where farmers perceive female-managed agro-input shops less favorably and situations where differences in ratings reflect real differences between male- and female-managed shops.
Farmer-level characteristics could also confound the relationship between an agro-input dealers gender and the rating that the farmer provides. For example, it may be that farmers who are better educated generally provide higher ratings. At the same time, it may be that better-educated farmers are more inclined to shop at male- managed agro-input dealerships. This makes it difficult to differentiate a gender equity effect from an effect arising from differences in education of the farmer. Fortunately, we often have instances where the same farmer rates both male- and female-managed agro-input shops. This allows us to exploit within-farmer variation for identification.
12
While we would be able to control for a farmers education level by simply including it in an OLS regression, a within-farmer transformation also controls for characteristics that would be difficult or impossible to measure and to control for, like motivation, kindness, locus of control, norms and values, etc. In other words, the within-farmer (fixed effects) estimator removes all farmer-level heterogeneity.
1 - 1 1 Yfd poh B (o - sym) + (1 - 5Eeee) (6) d d d
YpaVs =V(9taTp)
+ era
(7)
Finally, we will also run a fixed effects model that, in addition to controlling for farmer heterogeneity through fixed effects, also controls for dealer-level observable characteristics. We will again do this by including additional regressors (aq) in equation 7, which leads to:
pa  Us =V (Gra Fs) +9 (@pa Tp) + pa (8)
6 Results
Table 4 reports differences in perceived agro-input dealer quality between male- and female-managed agro-input outlets using an OLS regression based on equation 4. We find that on all but one dimension, male-managed agro- input shops are rated higher than female-managed shops, and the difference in rating is significant for five out of the seven comparisons (at a 10 percent significance level). The largest difference is found when farmers are asked to rate price competitiveness. Here, female-managed agro-input shops are scored only 3.237 out of 5, while male-managed agro-input shops receive a score of 3.437 out of 5. Equally large differences exist when farmers are asked to rate an agro-input dealer in terms of product availability. Here, male-managed agro-input shops receive an average score of almost 4 out of 5, while female dealers get 3.792. Interestingly, female-managed agro-input shops are not rated significantly worse with regards to the quality of seed sold. They also appear to be equally rated with respect to location.

GENDER, YOUTH, CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Cap Dev relevance: 2 - Principal. The network activities are focused on strengthening national capacities on forest genetic resources conservation and management through regional collaboration. [1- 3]. Asian countries host thousands of tree species, and individual countries do not have adequate technical and institutional capacities to effectively conserve and sustainably use them. Through regional networking it is possible to gain synergy in research and conservation activities, avoid overlapping efforts, accelerate learning and manage the constraints posed by limited resources. APFORGENs Regional Training Centre on Forest Genetic Resources has trained over 200 professionals since 2016
Climate Change relevance: 1 - Significant. Climate change is considered as one of the threats to species in the conservation assessments, and its impacts on species are assessed through distribution modeling with multiple climate scenarios. Results reveal most vulnerable species and areas for conservation, and offer recommendations for strengthening the adaptive capacity of species populations through restoration and management of genetic diversity [7- 13]
ELABORATION OF OUTCOME/IMPACT STATEMENT
APFORGEN is a regional forest genetic resources program consisting of a network of 15 member countries, established in 2003 by FAO, the Alliance (formerly the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute, IPGRI), and the Asia-Pacific Association of Forestry Research Institutions (APAFRI). Since its establishment, APFORGEN has been facilitated by the Alliance, including the development of three forest genetic resources regional strategies in 2014, 2018, and 2023. APFORGEN aims to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of forest genetic resources in the Asia-Pacific region supporting and linking national forest programs, research institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals interested in forest genetic resources conservation and use in the region [1].
R.Jalonen - Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT 
Since 2014, the Alliance has organized and facilitated three regional strategy development and review workshops (in 2014, 2017, and 2023) where member country National Coordinators identified and prioritized regional objectives and targets for joint research and capacity development [1].
These efforts resulted in three regional strategy documents (2014, 2017, 2023) that specify how APFORGEN activities, objectives, and targets explicitly link to and contribute to achieving the global conservation goals of the Global Plan of Action on Forest Genetic Resources and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework in the Asia-Pacific Region.
In 2017, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, FAO's highest forest decision-making body in the region, endorsed APFORGENs regional research and capacity development strategies [2,3,4,5]. Since then, Chairpersons of APFORGEN, elected from among its member countries National Coordinators, attend the biennial Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission meetings to update the Commission members on the networks activities and achievements [6].
The most recent Regional Strategy (2018-2022): Implementing the Global Plan of Action on Forest Genetic Resources in Asia and the Pacific [2] helped the network attract funding to implement its four strategic objectives. This included completing spatially explicit threat and conservation assessments for 63 socio-economically important species and strengthening capacities in three countries for native species restoration [8-10, 11-14]. The Regional Training Centre on Forest Genetic Resources, established in 2016 and coordinated by the Chinese Academy of Forestry, has trained 218 professionals from 17 countries through its workshops [11]. APFORGEN has significantly bolstered collaborative efforts in forest genetic resources management between countries in the Asia-Pacific region, evidenced by joint multi-country research publications [12-21] and exchange visits.
