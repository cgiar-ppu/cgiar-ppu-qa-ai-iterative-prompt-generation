Climate changemay favour pest and disease development and further exacerbate the vulnerability of smallholder farming systems to biotic constraints. Information on effects of climate change on pests and pathogens of banana is required by policy
makers and researchers in designing control strategies and adaptation plans. Since altitude is inversely related to temperature, this study used the occurrence of key banana pests and diseases along an altitude gradient as a proxy for the potential impact of changes in temperature associated with global warming on pests and diseases. We assessed the occurrence of banana pests and diseases in 93 banana fields across three altitude ranges in Burundi and 99 fields distributed in two altitude ranges in Rwanda watersheds. Incidence and prevalence of Banana Bunchy Top Disease (BBTD) and Fusarium wilt (FW) was significantly associated with temperature and altitude in Burundi, revealing that increasing temperatures may lead to upward movement of banana diseases. No significant associations with temperature and altitude were observed for weevils,
nematodes and Xanthomonas wilt of banana (BXW). Data collected in this study provides a baseline to verify and guide modelling work to predict future pest and disease distribution according to climate change scenarios.

Balancing these factors often exceeds most managers' capabilities, despite the existence of numerous data sets. 
This project aims to develop a Digital Twin, a real-time, data-backed digital replica of the ground situation. Enhanced with machine learning and AI, it will integrate available data and models, providing easy and intuitive access to information. Grounded in real data, its outputs will be of tangible value, making it indispensable to water resource managers once fully developed.","1041"

**Innovation Development** refers to a new, improved, or adapted output or groups of outputs such as technologies, products and services, policies, and other organizational and institutional arrangements with high potential to contribute to positive impacts when used at scale. Innovations may be at early stages of readiness (ideation or basic research) or at more mature stages of readiness (delivery and scaling).

### **Innovation Readiness Scale and Definitions:**

- **Innovation Readiness Level 0: Idea.**  
  The innovation is in the idea stage. The innovation is not yet being implemented.

- **Innovation Readiness Level 1: Basic Research.**  
  The innovation's basic principles are being researched for their ability to achieve an impact.

- **Innovation Readiness Level 2: Formulation.**  
  The innovation's basic principles are being formulated or designed.

- **Innovation Readiness Level 3: Proof of Concept.**  
  The innovation's key concepts have been validated for their ability to achieve a specific impact.

- **Innovation Readiness Level 4: Controlled Testing.**  
  The innovation is being tested for its ability to achieve a specific impact under fully-controlled conditions.

- **Innovation Readiness Level 5: Early Prototype.**  
  The innovation is validated for its ability to achieve a specific impact under fully-controlled conditions.

- **Innovation Readiness Level 6: Semi-controlled Testing.**  
  The innovation is being tested for its ability to achieve a specific impact under semi-controlled conditions.

- **Innovation Readiness Level 7: Prototype.**  
  The innovation is validated for its ability to achieve a specific impact under semi-controlled conditions.

- **Innovation Readiness Level 8: Uncontrolled Testing.**  
  The innovation is being tested for its ability to achieve a specific impact under uncontrolled conditions.

- **Innovation Readiness Level 9: Proven Innovation.**  
  The innovation is validated for its ability to achieve a specific impact under uncontrolled conditions.

### **Instructions:**

The objective of the Biodiversity in Agriculture Flagship Report is to raise countries’ understanding of the impact of agriculture on biodiversity and ecosystem services (nature) and provide them with the knowledge, policy tools and investment options to protect nature while meeting demand for food. The study will be used by the WB to influence their programs in selected countries and make recommendations over the type of safeguard that are needed in agricultural programs across their portfolio. The potential to have significant impact on those countries policy is very high.
