A Comprehensive Review of Land Use, Food Systems, and Socio-Economic Drivers' primarily focuses on understanding the drivers of deforestation and land use change in Peru's Amazon and Andes regions. A significant portion of the study addresses how deforestation contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, aligning directly with CGIAR's **Climate Mitigation** objective of transforming land systems into carbon sinks. Additionally, the research discusses policy measures, sustainable management strategies, and carbon sequestration efforts, which are crucial for climate policy and adaptation. Given that the primary objectives of the study are centered on mitigating climate change through the analysis of deforestation dynamics and informing policy decisions, it aligns directly with CGIAR's climate change objectives.
