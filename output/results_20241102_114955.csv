The project specifically aims to contribute to stakeholders’ understanding of how women can be equal partners and drivers of climate-smart solutions by 2024. It focuses on developing and testing methods and tools for designing and implementing Socio-Technical Innovation Bundles (STIBs) that empower women farmers in Ethiopia's Wolmera and Ejere woredas. 

Throughout the report, there is a consistent emphasis on gender inclusivity and empowering women farmers. Key activities include capacity-building initiatives tailored for women, financial literacy training, improving women’s access to agricultural inputs and financial services, and onboarding more female farmers. The challenges and next steps also highlight the need to enhance women’s participation and address gender-specific barriers.

This aligns directly with CGIAR's key objective of 'Closing the Gender Gap' by addressing disparities in economic resources, ownership, and control over land and natural resources for women in food, land, and water systems.

The primary goal is to develop targeted and timely advisory packages for livestock farmers through platforms like iShamba. 

While the main focus is on improving livestock advisories based on farmer interactions and messaging patterns, the research significantly incorporates environmental health aspects by analyzing the impact of extreme weather conditions on livestock productivity. It recognizes that climate hazards like prolonged absence of rain and heat stress directly affect livestock and prompt farmer concerns about crop health and pesticide use. 

By exploring how climate hazards influence farmer inquiries and developing predictive models to anticipate information needs, the research contributes meaningfully to CGIAR's objectives in environmental health, specifically in climate adaptation and mitigation. However, environmental health is a secondary consideration rather than the primary focus of the study.

Therefore, according to the tagging criteria, this research should be assigned a tag of **1 = Significant** because it contributes to environmental health objectives indirectly by addressing the impacts of climate hazards on livestock farming, even though the primary objective is not solely centered on environmental health or biodiversity.""

The research also targeted women and marginalized groups as recipients of the Kisan Credit Card, improving their access to financial resources. These efforts align directly with CGIAR's key objectives of poverty alleviation and reducing poverty among men, women, and children. Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this research warrants a tag of **2 (Principal)**, as it would not have been conducted without the intention to contribute to these specific objectives."
