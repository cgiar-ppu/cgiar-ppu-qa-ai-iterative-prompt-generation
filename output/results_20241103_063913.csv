  ""explanation"": ""The research focuses on accelerating genetic gains in drought- and heat-resilient, biofortified common bean varieties in Africa. It discusses the development of improved bush and climbing bean varieties, collaboration with the Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA), and breeding processes that adjust to feedback from farmers and seed companies. However, there is no mention of gender equality, women's empowerment, or initiatives aimed at addressing disparities between men and women. The research does not align with CGIAR's gender equality objectives of closing the gender gap or providing gender-inclusive opportunities. Therefore, it should be assigned a tag of 0 (Not Targeted) as it does not address or contribute to gender equality outcomes.""
