"17","Test_V1","Test **Text to Analyze:** [INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Yam breeding network in Africa addresses breeding challenges to develop consumer-demanded, more productive, pest and disease resistant White and Water Yam varieties; Nigeria releases three Yam varieties. In collaboration with national yam breeding programs in Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana and Benin, IITA yam breeding seeks to develop and deploy end-user preferred White Yam and Water Yam varieties with higher yield, greater resistance to pests and diseases and improved quality, targeted at West Africa. Together these collaborators seek to address common yam breeding challenges: reducing lengthy crop cycles to 3-4 years, poor seed multiplication ratio, poor understanding of genetic diversity, limited breeding enabling technologies, and limited current capacity in West Africa. In 2023, significant strides were made in enhancing the efficiency of breeding programs, including defining the yam market segmentation, refining the yam product profile, deploying marker assisted selection, and use of quantitative genetics methods to optimize breeding approaches. Yam consumers participated in elite clone selection. Two white varieties and one water yam variety were released in collaboration with the National Root Crops Research Institute in Nigeria.","220"
"28","Test_V1","Test **Text to Analyze:** [INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","International wheat breeding networks accelerate genetic gains for climate-resilient, nutritious, market-demanded varieties with durable disease resistance for smallholders in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The CIMMYT Global Wheat Program is one of the most important public sources of high yielding, nutritious, disease- and climate-resilient wheat varieties for Africa, Asia, and Latin America; its lines are found in varieties sown on more than 60 million hectares worldwide. The program works with ICARDA and more than 200 local research and breeding institutions, sharing climate-resilient, Zinc-biofortified, high- yielding, disease and pest tolerant wheat lines and data. National partners are active participants in breeding, many of them managing precise phenotyping platforms or using the lines for local breeding efforts. Molecular breeding tools, bioinformatics and speed breeding have resulted in a cycle time of 3 years in spring wheat. During 2023, partners in Bangladesh, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Spain and Türkiye registered 55 varieties for use, including 45 selected for climate resilience, and 20 varieties biofortified for Zinc.","241"
"30","Test_V1","Test **Text to Analyze:** [INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Bread wheat breeding network accelerates genetic gains for high-yielding, climate-resilient varieties that meet consumer preferences in semi-arid/arid regions in Africa, Central and West Asia. Ethiopia releases a dryland variety. As demand for wheat grows rapidly across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, ICARDA is addressing the growing climatic challenges, pests, and diseases that hinder its domestic production by generating an effective wheat-breeding strategy. The resulting wheat varieties deliver high yield potential, resistance/tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and acceptable end-use qualities. ICARDA's bread wheat breeding program develops new candidate varieties in collaboration with public and private sector partners and farmers, through two breeding pipelines targeted at 1. Rainfed spring bread wheat for Central and West Asia, and North, Eastern, Southern and West Africa dry lands, and 2. Heat tolerant spring bread wheat for Eastern, Southern, West and North Africa, and Central and West Asia regions. The current breeding cycle time is 4 years. Ethiopia releases one dryland variety for use by farmers.","224"
"31","Test_V1","Test **Text to Analyze:** [INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","Durum wheat breeding network accelerates genetic gains for more productive, resilient varieties that meet end-user requirements for farmers in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. As demand for pasta and semolina products grows across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, ICARDA durum breeding is addressing the climatic challenges, pests, and diseases that hinder domestic production. The resulting varieties deliver drought and heat tolerance, stable production across seasons, resistances to major biotic stresses, and meet end-users requirements. Together with public and private sector partners and farmers, six breeding pipelines target the global drylands: 1. South Asia drylands - limited irrigation, 2. West/Central Asia drylands - rainfed, 3. North Africa drylands - rainfed, 4. East Africa drylands - rainfed, 5. High-cold drylands - rainfed, 6. West Africa savannas - irrigated. The current breeding cycle time is 2 years, using speed breeding, genomic selection, and exploiting rare alleles from genebank accessions.  During 2023, Iran, Syria and Morocco released six varieties for use. Drought tolerant ‘Jawahir, released in 2022, was added to the WOCAT database of the United Nations.","266"
"32","Test_V1","Test **Text to Analyze:** [INPUT_TEXT]","gpt-4o-mini","Gender","West and Central African maize breeding network accelerates genetic gains for climate-resilient and nutrient-enriched varieties that meet the increasing demands for food and feed by the formal and informal markets In collaboration with public and private sector partners and farmers, maize breeding efforts in West and Central Africa seek to improve yields, drought tolerance, Striga and pest resistance within four breeding pipelines: 1. Early and extra-early maturing yellow and orange maize for fresh maize market, poultry feed and home consumption, 2. Early and extra early maturing white maize primarily for processing and home consumption, 3. Intermediate and late maturing yellow and orange maize for fresh maize market, poultry feed and home consumption, 4. Intermediate and late maturing white maize primarily for processing and home consumption. Orange and yellow varieties are also biofortified for Provitamin A. Current breeding cycle time is 2 years, and has been reduced through the use of functional markers and genomic selection to accelerate the rate of genetic gains. During 2023, women farmers implemented 29% of the 325 on-farm trials. Partners in five countries registered 12 varieties.","236"
