CGIAR supported the process in several ways, which was reported by this Initiative in 2022. Even though work remains to implement the guidelines, in 2023, policy windows of opportunity remain open. For example, the new Healthy Diet Coalition, a government-led platform, has listed implementation of the guidelines as one of their activities. The Ethiopian Food Systems Transformation and Nutrition Inter-ministerial Steering Committee (the governance structure for Ethiopia's food systems transformation agenda) was inaugurated in May 2023.

To aim for 2 million tons in 5 years (2028), with stable capture fisheries 
production (800K) and aquaculture to reach 1.2 million tons,  
aquaculture must grow by 35% annually and produce additional 
900,000 tons.  This is a tall order!
Where will this come from? What investments are needed and how to 
promote this investment?

Where can we see growth in tilapia production?
•GIFT strain – WorldFish’ calculations of a 10 -year program involving 150,000 
smallholders, to produce 720,000 tons of tilapia, with a total farmgate value of USD 1.4 
billion
•Greenhouse gas emissions and environmental sustainability of tilapia farming appears 
to be better than that of catfish. 
•More than 60 percent of farmers surveyed were interested in growing tilapia. 
•Assumption: farmers will enter/produce; input suppliers/service providers will operate;  
consumers will increase fish consumption or substitute fish/meat for tilapia? (future 
research question and data gap)Where can we see growth in catfish production?
•No new strains anticipated in the near future
•Can we stimulate more producers to grow → more efficient cage system and 
RAS (recirculating aquaculture system)?
•How can we stimulate greater production of catfish?
•How can we expand processing
•How can we start to export?91317

Large untapped water 
resources
•835 km of coastline
•Inland water surface = 14 million ha
•Total available inland water suitable for aquaculture development = 1.75 
million ha
•Estimated aquaculture potential (based on 10% of suitable water surface 
and average fish yield potential of 15/tons/year) = 2.66 million tons
•260+ medium and large dams
•48,000 ha of swamp areas (good for fish farming)
Assumptions: farmers will enter/produce; input suppliers/service 
providers will operate; feed and seed quality improved and become 
accessible to farmers? 
Page 8:
Training and promotion of good 
management practices
•Currently poor management practices among farmers
•Limited knowledge on good management practices 
•Studies show that training is effective in improving 
agriculture and aquaculture practices 
•Good agricultural and postharvest practices more 
effective for controlling aflatoxin (Hoffman et al. 
2021)
•Aquaculture practices increased by 20 -30% fish 
production, productivity, and incomes in Ghana 
(Ragasa et al. 2022); income in Egypt (Dickson et 
al. 2016)
•Increase of 0.45 more kg of fish harvested per 
sqm, or 4.5 ton/ha. Additional income of USD 627 
per trainee per year on average (Ragasa et al. 
2022)
•300,000 tons of aquaculture production →Training can 
potentially add 20,000 to 90,000 tons of farmed fish; 
plus it can encourage new farmers to enter because of 
greater productivity →multiplier effect along the value 
chain.
Page 9:
(2) Growth from other farmed 
species 
(30% of aquaculture production)
•Opportunities to expand crustacean / shrimps
exports
oRe-approval of Nigeria and its Aquaculture 
Residue Monitoring plan for crustacean, 
allowing the export of aquaculture crustacean to 
EU and UK
oRecertification of Nigeria for shrimp export 
through the verification of and use of Turtle 
Excluder Device: Nigeria has been recertified to 
export shrimps to the US.
oCompliance with the requirement of the US 
Regulation on Marine Mammal Protection to 
sustain continuous export of Nigeria 
fish/shrimps into the US.
oDiversification of more cultivable fish species 
targeting commercially viable indigenous fish 
species such as Lates niloticus (Nile perch), 
Gymnarchus niloticus (Aba, knifefish), Labeo , etc.
Page 10:
Growth from artisanal 
capture fisheries 
•Wild fish caught by small -scale fishers provide the 
bulk of Nigeria’s fish supply, however there is very 
little information available on species -level catch
•Sub-optimal artisanal fishery production does not 
contribute adequately to bridging the supply -demand 
gap
•Can we substitute imported fish with improved 
capture fisheries? Which species?
•Potential solutions:
•Better co -management and co -planning with 
communities (how much growth we can 
expect?)
•Better information/data on specie catch and 
stock
•Stock enhancement (how much growth we can 
expect)
✓Artisanal fishing communities should be 
empowered in identifying issues related to 
artisanal fisheries decision -making processes.
✓Establish rural fisheries organizations/groups 
and women’s groups, fishers and women 
groups for partnership development and 
management. 
✓Develop an entrepreneurship plan for 
partnership management, including fishing 
plans.
Page 11:
Potential 
strategies 
Sundried pelagic fish 
should be promoted
Consumption of small pelagic 
fish, increases economic and 
geographic access in local, 
often remote markets. 
High -yielding, eco -friendly, 
low carbon -emission way of 
using the high productive 
potential of inland waters to 
produce nutritious food. 
The vast Niger Delta, home to nutrient -
rich species such as oysters, periwinkles, 
clams, and cockles are primarily harvested 
or gleaned by women ( Nlerum & Bagshaw, 
2015). 
Rich in omega3 fatty acids and vitamin B -12 
(Golden et al., 2021). 
However, water pollution from crude oil 
and gas companies is a commonly reported 
threat to the periwinkle harvest ( Moruf , 
2020; Nlerum & Bagshaw, 2015)
More research is urgently needed to 
address the threats to this aspect of the 
small -scale fisheries sector. 
An important priority is to determine the 
number of women in Nigeria engaged in 
the shellfish industry, and to more 
adequately quantify shellfish production 
(Chuku et al., 2020). 
Page 12:
REDUCTION OF 
FISH LOSS AND 
WASTE
•Various estimates, depending on species:
o8% of catfish, tilapia, and Nile perch are lost during the 
production or landing phases of capture fisheries
o>5% of tilapia and Nile perch may go to waste at the 
market
oadditional 4 –10% of the fish may be lost during processing
oUp to 30% of freshwater clupeids harvest may be lost if not 
processed on time.
•Mortality and spoilage occurs during live fish transportation.
•Fish processing is mostly ad hoc; chain actors use rudimentary, 
unstandardized techniques with regard to fish smoking or 
drying.
•Potential solutions:
oInvestment plans targeted at improving fish processing 
and transportation technologies; cold chains
oDesign, test and manufacture effective practical 
transportation equipment with aeration systems to 
increase survival of live fish.
•Potentially 100,000 to 300,000 tons of fish saved if fish loss and 
waste along the value chain are minimized
•Data gap: we need good data on fish loss and waste and on 
what works and does not work
Page 13:
RISK AND DISEASE 
MANAGEMENT 
•Fish diseases can be devastating 
•Disease -related production losses in Nigeria are widely 
reported, but economic impacts are not known.
oMukaila et al. (2023) estimates a mortality rate 
ranging from 1.86% to 19.73%, which was valued 
at USD 192.79 to USD 2056.38 per production 
cycle, respectively, small -scale catfish farms 
•Health management and disease control in Nigerian 
aquaculture, especially among smallholders and small -
to medium -scale farming practices, is minimal. 
•Aquatic animal health management capacity within the 
national veterinary system is minimal. 
•Limited private sector engagement in aquaculture health 
management needs improvement and strengthening. 
•It is important to assess national aquatic animal health 
management capacity and embark on a technology and 
capacity development program.
Page 14:
EXPLICIT ATTENTION 
TO NUTRITION
•Issue: 
✓Fish supply in Nigeria is estimated at around 24 
g/person/day, which is substantially higher than 
other animal source foods such as other meats (21 
g/person/day), eggs (8.2 g/person/day), and milk 
(3.5 g/person/day). But lower than global average.
✓Nigeria's annual per capita fish consumption in the 
southern region (16.9 kg) was higher than in the 
northern region (6.1 kg) in 2020, though the 
southern region's average fish price is 50% higher. 
✓Fish diversity and nutritional benefits through 
consumption of indigenous species are limited. 
✓No science -based, organized inland fisheries 
management programs are in place, resulting in low 
and irregular catches and availability of nutritious 
inland indigenous species to consumers.
Page 15:
FOCUS ON NUTRITION
•Increasing access to nutrient -rich fish and fish products 
presents investment opportunities. 
•Fish supplies should be increased and supply chains aligned 
to make fish affordable and accessible to the rural poor, with 
special emphasis on northern states. 
•Dried crayfish is a staple aquatic food product in southern 
states and wealthier households but is not accessed by 
northern households. Given that it is a nutrient -dense, shelf -
stable and readily transportable product, promotion in 
northern states should be explored.
•Greater awareness of the importance of fish in the nutrition 
of children and pregnant women isneeded.
•Promoting the use of products such as fish powder would 
improve access to fish among young children.
•FDF and its partners should be monitoring and evaluating 
improvement in fish consumption (quantity, diversity, and 
nutrition)

TRADE -OFFS: 
GROWTH 
VERSUS 
NUTRITION•With scarce resources, we need to prioritize and be efficient!
•Use of food -grade fish, especially nutrient -rich freshwater and 
marine pelagic fish, as a fishmeal VERSUS using them 
affordable, nutritious food for rural and urban poor?
•Promote catfish OR tilapia OR other farmed species –how to 
prioritize funding and investments?
•Promoting Aquaculture versus Import ban to stimulate local 
production VERSUS higher fish prices and detrimental for 
nutrition?
•Investing in aquaculture versus small -scale capture fisheries?
•Useful versus Harm subsidies?
•Knowledge and data -which data to fill first? What are the 
most important data needed to inform policy and 
investment?
•Many trade -offs and questions remain, but some are win -win 
strategies for all subsectors: Enabling environment + 
Infrastructure (electricity, roads and transportation, cold 
chain, ease of doing business)

 pg. 2               Background:  Digitalization in Agriculture (including Analytics, AI, Robotics) is transforming existing business processes and enabling new means to deploy innovative services and products at an unimaginable scale and pace.   Digital agriculture has a much broader scope with the potential use in the areas of supply chains, access to finance and markets, contextual advisory, building farmer networks etc. The term fourth agricultural revolution is also used interchangeably with digital agriculture - the use of digital and precision tools across agriculture – where hyper spectral satellites, IOT, robotics, AI etc are being used in agriculture and allied sectors and are giving rise to innovations across all stages of the food, inputs and water value chain.  Project Goal   The goals for an Agri stack for Uttar Pradesh should include:   1. Increase Agricultural Productivity: By providing farmers with actionable insight through access to real-time data on weather conditions, soil health, and crop yields, and help make better decisions about planting, irrigation, and fertilization.   2. Improve livelihoods: Improve farmers' livelihoods by connecting them with markets and buyers, and help them sell their produce at better prices.   3. Enhance Resilience: Improve financial resilience through insurance products as well as to climate change by identifying areas that are most vulnerable and using Data and information to protect their crops.   4. Digitization of Agriculture and farmers: The project should aim to digitize agriculture and farmers by creating a digital platform that allows farmers to access important information and connect with buyers and the government.   5. Improve the Agri economy and hence overall economic condition of Farmers: Increase agricultural productivity, profitability, and resilience for farmers and have a significant impact on the overall economy.   6. Enhancing Farmer Trust and Digital literacy: Improve the acceptability of digital solutions and technologies by the farmers through improved accreditation, validation of Ag Tech claims and improved digital literacy.  7. Balancing Farmers interests for Data confidentiality and economic benefit: Ensure that the Farmer data is not misused and the Farmers / State / National interests are protected. At the same time, while protecting confidentiality, ensure that Agri Data is leveraged for its economic potential and a regulated but commercially viable Agri Data market place is created across the Govt, Private sector and the Farmer.   Alignment of AgriStack and DataStack:  There has been a lot of work done by the Central and State Governments, Academic, Research Institutions, and the Private Sector in conceptualising different approaches and aspects of an “AgriStack” to transform Indian Agriculture. An AgriStack is envisioned as an “enabling framework of Services (applications) and Agri Data around a data exchange”, built to support several Agri use cases, while encouraging application and data interoperability using well defined interfaces.   A well designed AgriStack will help reduce duplication by integrating data sources and a vast backend of new and existing applications: Govt’s eNam, ITC’s eChoupal, NCDEX’s NeML, APEDA’s TraceNet, etc related to logistics, weather, supply-chain, warehousing, assaying, recommendation engines, etc.  There is a need to integrate into all this a focussed discussion and engagement on an Open Agri Data Stack which forms the backbone of the AgriStack aligned to the several critical use cases chosen by the State Government of Uttar Pradesh.  At the core of Digital Agriculture is an increasing amount of live and real-time “Data” which is being rapidly generated by both - the Government through its farmer friendly programs (including DBT and other schemes) and also the Private Sector as a by-product of business applications or through remote sensing (satellite imagery). Physical maps being digitized is an example, while another is through the multiplicity of payment and Agri trading platforms. In addition, there is a rapid increase in precision farming applications generating “machine-data” from:    • Drones / UAV (e.g. real-time monitoring of farms enabling mapping, surveying, 3D modelling)  • Satellites and remote sensing (providing direct farmer advisory, for yield estimation, early pest warning etc.)

 pg. 3 • Robotics (e.g. nutrient injection, harvesting, targeting high precision weed removal) • Automated Material Handling  (e.g. harvesting equipment, grain/food processors) • Farm sensors and management (e.g. for soil moisture, water and nutrient injection) • Mobile cameras (e.g. for identifying pest, nutrient deficiencies)  This mountain of data, once anonymised, aggregated and processed can be re-purposed using AI for different use cases - raising yields, optimising national resources and doubling farmer income.  Approach to a Data Stack for Uttar Pradesh:  Given this context, this approach paper, seeks to lay down some practical suggestions to start with – using which we can to contribute to the Farmer’s benefit as well as the broader debate on an AgriStack architecture and the specific data building blocks needed.   Through this process we will need to understand and uncover both the explicit and the implicit expectations of the Government of Uttar Pradesh and several interested entities (Public, Private, Research, and Academia) from the AgriStack and translate these into defining and designing a data stack reference design that becomes the core building block of the proposed AgriStack. Ultimately, this will need work across multi-stakeholder interest groups to enable deeper clarity in understanding and defining “Open Agri Data” for the AgriStack and help converge ideas and actions.  Use Case led approach:  Very often attempts to work on complex, multi-year Agri problems, however well-intentioned (and regardless of how these attempts begin) end up adopting a “technology first”, feature focussed approach, sometimes driven by a specific company’s solution.   Instead we suggest, adopting a farmer-centric use case approach, with the use cases prioritised carefully by the Government for maximum societal impact. This allows the Government to coalesce several related Agri technologies and overlapping Ag Tech Start-ups together for working on the use case.  This shift in focus, though subtle, requires tough implementation focus to hold course, but produces long term sustainable results.   Elements to consider for aligning an Agri Data Stack to an Use Case led approach:  We recommend, that to inject more specificity, engagement be held as suggested above, in line with key use cases identified by the State Government, which they wish to be enabled by AgriStack and the consequent Agri Data Stack. We need to identify several objectives for each use case, focussing on specific data elements needed for each:  a) Build a 360° view of the “problem statement” for the Use Case with a “To-Be” state for the short / medium / long term. b) Identify the strategic levers needed to solve the use case. c) Identify Data elements and then the consequent Data sets needed for each strategic lever. d) Identify the sources of Data sets / elements with a view of authenticating the data.  Discussion around each use case will focus on answering the following types of questions (illustrative, not comprehensive):  1) What data (spatial and temporal resolution) is needed for the use case to be deployed for a farmer? 2) What data is currently available with central Govt. or the state Govt. or private enterprises? 3) What are the data gaps for this use case to be enabled at the desired level of scale and granularity? 4) How can these data gaps be filled? Does the Govt. need to revamp or adapt existing data collection methods or incorporate  secondary or private data sets to fill these gaps? 5) What are the building blocks for each use case which can developed in open source as a Digital Public Good (DPG)? 6) How to build the Agri Data Stack while being cognizant of data governance standards – access, privacy, interoperability, quality and incentive for the data owners? 7) Who are the diverse stakeholders who could play a role in each of the thematic areas? 8) What are the policy measures required to make the data based digital tools deployment beneficial for the Indian farmers?   Integrating State Govt’s Use cases with Public & Private data sources through an Agri Data Stack:  Some key areas of interest to the Government of Uttar Pradesh:  1) Credit and Rural finance for the smallholder farmers. 2) Actionable and context specific advisory for farmers, especially to prevent pest and disease. 3) Market Linkages and Price forecasting to reduce food wastage.  Process steps for UP State Govt to AgTechs and Data Stack for different types of use cases:  Adopting a use-case-led approach requires identifying and mapping data sets needed for Agri technologies provided by start-ups. Identification and validation of these use cases and the shortlisting of startups to implement solutions in turn needs thorough research and review of the market dynamics, the existing startup landscape, and their tech capabilities/solutions. Scoping of the Use case, identifying strategic levers associated to the use case, technology/capabilities maturity and the adoption of emerging technologies can be a few parameters in evaluating startups to participate in a Data Stack Project.  
Page 4:
 
 pg. 4  Based on these parameters, and feedback from other Stat es, we suggest three categories of use cases that require slightly different approaches in evaluating and selecting the right technology partner for the pilot and eventually the implementation. These categories are briefly described below:  1. “Broad Scope” Use Cases: These are problem Identification and selection of start-ups to work on Broad Scope Use Cases can be done by floating a request for proposal. The scope can be narrowed down to suit the requirements of the use case. Advanced validation is needed to identify the top 2 or 3 start-ups post the evaluation and shortlisting of proposals. An example of a broad-scope Use Case can be Farmer Credit, Market access, Actionable Advisory, Irrigation, etc.  2. Narrow Scope Use Case: Use Cases that are narrow in scope are those that typically could serve to be building blocks as a part of several other use cases. For instance, Electronic Farm Records, Crop acreage etc are relatively narrow in scope and could be used as building blocks for several “Broader” use cases. These would require a request for a limited “discover pilot” to assess the specific usability and technical capabilities of the start-ups. Working with a limited number of start-ups who could carry out a pilot to meet the requirements is a way forward.   3. Emerging Tech-Based Use Cases: Solutions on emerging technologies require considering various use cases to apply the technology. This can help review and narrow down the capabilities and also allows the start-ups in showcasing and demonstrating their technologies. An example can be the use of Robotics for various use cases like the plucking of cotton, precision seeding, removing weeds, etc  The process steps for all three categories of use cases in the implementation of a Data Stack are shown below (refer to Diagram 1).

 pg. 6  Annexure1: Strategic considerations for an Agri Data Stack:   Digitization of Agriculture and Agri Data often raise questions about Data Interoperability (standardisation, calibration, certification), policies, privacy, regulation, data sharing, scope, sources (including govt and private), farmer trust, data confidentiality, and data governance. Even though these are initial days for the State Govt of UP’s work on Agri Data Stack, below are some important considerations that merit discussion in the context of a Data Stack:  • Agricultural Data Interoperability:  Given the overall potential for the Agri sector, it is important for us to ensure an enabling, transparent and well governed  framework for data, information, and domain knowledge sharing to allow all players to succeed and grow. Agriculture’s economic viability will improve via democratized and streamlined access to finance, advisory, supply chain, and markets.   The Agriculture sector is plagued by dozens of siloed software applications and islands of data, providing little benefit. Disaggregated and non-standardized data is deemed un-trustworthy and rendered partially ineffective for further processing. Standardization will help improve “data-trust” furthering automation using AI models, also avoiding real-world biases creeping into AI prediction. Agri data interoperability across the Government and the private sector will incubate new business models (Agri and non-Agri) providing transformative impact similar to how Aadhaar with UPI transformed digital payments..    • Involve the AgTech Ecosystem into creating an Agri Data Stack: Like in any digital innovation, digital agriculture also flourishes within an ecosystem. The existence of a spectrum of data is the key to spurring innovations in digital agriculture. The concepts of data hubs, data stacks, and data exchanges have emerged to enable a frictionless way of aggregation (data from different sources), organization, management, distribution, sharing, and sub-letting of data while enforcing data governance.    • Data governance will be crucial to engender Farmer and AgTech Trust A key challenge lies in finding a balance between leveraging the Data potential for the sector’s growth and farmers’ economic interests by fostering greater trust through carefully drafted State policies for monetisation, access, usage etc-  while protecting the Farmer privacy and confidentiality of agricultural data.   State level Data usage policies should be framed for several tricky issues like personal vs public ownership, shared monetization, portability, oversight and protection, processing rights, inter-operability standards, etc., keeping these in context of newly introduced terms in the centrally drafted “Data Protection Bill” like Data “Controller”, “Processor”, “Principal”, “Trustee or Custodian”.    These issues have been grouped below for simpler understanding and discussion:     1) Data Usage (ownership, access, monetization etc.),  2) Data Trust through data Interoperability (standardization, calibration certification), and enhanced focus on digital literacy. 3) Data Portability (across digital Agri service providers to enable a competitive environment)  For long term sustenance of these efforts, while we inject digital technology and innovation into Agriculture to drive growth and enable Farmers and Farming to become profitable, resilient, and sustainable - we must adopt sound data governance.  Much of this data pertains to small and marginal Farmers largely at the bottom of the financial and digital pyramid and hence we need to ensure they are not unknowingly exploited, financially bypassed by others using their farm data, for selfish business benefit and market manipulation.   • Regulatory Agri Sandbox can streamline Regulation and Innovation needs of the Government of Uttar Pradesh. An Agri Sandbox suitably designed can be a catalyst to help synthesise the often conflicting regulatory and Innovation requirements between the State Govt along and the Ag Tech Start Ups. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) / The World Bank Group, aspires to partner with the Government of Uttar Pradesh, to build and run India’s first Hybrid Regulatory Sandbox for Agriculture, created in a unique “Hub & Spoke” arrangement.   This will help scale-up AgTechs by removing inhibitors and advancing key policy, regulatory, innovation enablers that enhance AgTech competitiveness, scale and impact to the State’s Agriculture within a four-year project period.   Within this project we will seek to:  a) increase the number of AgTechs in the State, across the entire agricultural value chain b) increase revenue for AgTechs operating in the State,  c) increased number of AgTechs graduating from early stage to commercial scale.   • Data Partnerships will accelerate innovation  Efforts to harness this dataflow and facilitate “data partnerships” between Government of Uttar Pradesh and AgTech Start-ups, Corporates, Research, Academia based on either direct or indirect business benefit will accelerate the penetration of innovation.

 pg. 7 This will create new business models and partnerships across the value-chain (insurance, market access, assaying etc.)that help monetise data further contributing to improved productivity and profitability of  Agriculture and other sectors as well.   Annexure2: Illustrative Approach using Use Case: Credit and Rural finance for the smallholder farmers  Problem Statement  Simplify Agri loan assessment for Small/Medium farmers to facilitate loan products at minimal cost in the shortest period and help lenders mitigate their risk, monitor credit usage, and improve loan recovery.  Context • A holistic approach towards Agri Finance and credit to extend purpose-neutral Loans based on digital assessment, backed by insurance. • Consider cash flow lending acknowledging the collective economic need of rural households. • Streamline process by leveraging tech to democratize farmer outreach and minimize touch points by embedding all regulatory & KCC requirements in the system.  Aspects to consider • Creating a Digital Profile/Identity of the Farmer (reliable, digital, private, anonymous) • An end-to-end approach - farmers avail loan/credit, secure crop insurance and exit by selling produce  loan repayment. • Use data from multiple sources – farmer, government, autonomous, digital, manual, to assess the farmer after consent. • Credit assessment of the farmer to be linked to the farmer's household’s credit history including loans from microfinance, NREGA, NBFCs, banks, savings, insurance, and cash flows, to increase visibility of savings and assessing financial discipline. • Credit/Loan products to be created based on history of loan payments and savings. • Cash flow lending; and direct payment to supplier (vs cash to farmer) and recover dues in bullet repayments (vs EMI) • Motivate lenders to expand the loan book and reduce NPAs by improving usage visibility. • Validate the Risk Scores with assessment on the ground. • Break current barriers of physical proximity of a branch/office of the lender in managing the credit lifecycle.

1. INTRODUCTION  
The Republic of Zambia Ministry of Green Economy and Environment has appointed Mamadi International 
Limited (hereafter referred to as Mamadi) to undertake the Development of a National Framework for 
Weather, Water and Climate Services (NFWWCS -ZM). The NFWWCS -ZM is an institutional tool that aims 
to enhance collaboration among national institutions. 99Its goal is to improve the co -production, tailoring, 
delivery, and utilization of science -based weather, water, and climate forecasts and services. This is achieve d 
through focusing on the five pillars of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS).  
The NFWCS was developed in cooperation with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to strengthen 
the production, availability, delivery, and application of science -based climate monitoring and prediction 
services. During the Sixteenth World Meteorolog ical Congress, Resolution 47 (Cg -16) mandated that WMO 
lead the development of the GFCS Implementation Plan with the active involvement of relevant stakeholders, 
including United Nations bodies. To produce and apply climate services, the GFCS addresses the  entire 
value chain. This Framework is designed to mainstream climate science into decision -making at all levels 
and ensure that every country and every climate -sensitive sector of society can access and use relevant 
climate information. Through the develo pment and incorporation of science -based weather and climate 
information and prediction services into planning, policy, and practice, the Framework seeks to enable better 
management of climate variability and change at all levels.  
The Government of Zambia strives to reduce the vulnerability of the country to climate change. The frequency 
and severity of floods and droughts are expected to increase in various parts of Zambia in the future. Small 
farmers in rural areas of Zambia are h ighly vulnerable due to their reliance on agriculture which is dependent 
on rainfall. To enhance Zambia's resilience to climate change, the Ministry of Green Economy and 
Environment through the Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD) is working in partnersh ip with the 
Accelerating the Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research in Africa (AICCRA) project to create a National 
Framework for Climate Services for Zambia. Through this joint initiative between ZMD and AICCRA, Mamadi 
is undertaking the Development of a Natio nal Framework for Weather, Water and Climate Services.  
It is against this background that the stakeholders’ consultative workshop was held to facilitate the 
development of the NFWWCS for Zambia with full participation of all identified stakeholders.  It brought 
together all identified key stakeholders to draw consensus on the urgent need for improved weather, water, 
and climate services in the country and to identify the gaps and key elements for development of a national 
strategic plan and costed action plan for implementation of the NFWCS, focusing on areas fo r joint action.  
The main aim of the workshop was to involve experts from the NMHS and relevant regional/global climate 
centres in the country, government departments, universities and research institutions, key decision -makers, 
partners, and practitioners. The workshop fa cilitated identification of appropriate mechanisms to improve and 
sustain the flow, co -production, and delivery of user -salient climate information for different users. 
Specifically, it will result in:

2. OPENING REMARKS  
The workshop was opened by Mr. Edson Nkonde – Director of the Zambia Meteorological Department, Dr. 
Inga Jacobs -Mata, AICCRA Zambia Lead . 
Dr. Ernest Afiesimama, representative of the World Meteorological Organization , and Mr. Mamadi Mabu - 
Lead Consultant and Chairman  of Mamadi and Company .  
The workshop was officially opened by the guest of honor Hon. Eng. Collins Nzovu, MP, the Minister of the 
Green Economy and Environment.  
During their opening remarks, the speakers pointed out key issues that are summarized as follows:  
• Closer coordination - The National Framework for Weather, Water and Climate services is necessary 
as it will develop an institutional mechanism to coordinate, facilitate and strengthen the collaboration 
among national institutions that will improve the co -production, tailoring, delivery and use of science -
based climate predictions and services for decision -making in climate -sensitive socio -economic 
sectors such as agriculture and food securi ty, water, energy, disaster risk reduction, health, aviation, 
among  others.

• Review current status of weather, water and climate services provided in the country and recommend 
further improvements.  
• The workshop has brought together different stakeholders with a role in weather, water and climate 
services’ value chain pointing to needs of closer coordination.  
• Hopeful that once developed, the framework will promote strong partnerships at national level that is 
needed for successful provision of climate services which inform climate -sensitive decision -making, 
and effectively contribute to sustainable development and resilience -building of communities and the 
country’s economy.  
• The role of the NFWWCS will be to strengthen and facilitate weather, water and climate services not 
to duplicate the already happening services.  
• Bring together all the available provisions and share resources towards the NFWWCS.  
• Government commitment critical to the establishment and operationalization of the NFWWCS  
• Strengthening the climate service capacities - The opportunity to evaluate the status of weather, 
water and climate services in Zambia and propose ways and means of improving the services.  
• There is need to build a climate sensitive society as climate change poses serious threats.  
• Timely and accurate information - People informed early and act early  
The progress in the implementation of a National Framework for Climate Services (NFWWCS -Zambia) was 
given by Mr. Mamadi Mabu who gave a background on the development of the GFCS and how it evolved 
from global to national level with the establishment of NFCSs that has been developed under the umbrella of 
the GFCS, established to harness both scientific and technologic al advances to enhance the development 
of tailored climate forecasts and predictions in support of climate risk management and adaptation plann ing 
to climate change decision -making, Went on to explain why Zambia needs the NFWWCS to improve the 
country’s preparedness and resilience to impacts of climate variabilities and change, outlined the process of 
developing it and where it is now.  
3. WORKSHOP  
The Ministry of Green Economy and Environment (MGEE) through the Zambia Meteorological Department 
(ZMD) hosted a three -day national Stakeholders’ Consultation Workshop at Urban Hotel in Lusaka, Zambia 
from 14 to 16 November 2023 to develop a National Framework for Weather, Water and Climate Services 
(NFWWCS) for Zambia. This workshop was held in accordance with the NFWWCS steps as provided by the 
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Step -By-Step Guidelines for National Framework for Weather, 
Water and Cl imate Services.  
Most identified key stakeholders drawn from government, and private organization as well as ZMD’s local 
and international partners attended the workshop. Seven national priority sectors were considered for the

workshop, six of them were represented and these were the Water, Agriculture and Food Security, Energy, 
Health, Human Settlement and Disaster Risk Reduction while there was no representative from Biodiversity.  
On day one of the workshop, selected institutions out of each sector were tasked to present an overview of 
the national sector -based climate -sensitive user landscape and share the impact of climate change on the 
sector. The presentations were divided into two sessions. Each session comprising of three sectors as 
follows:  
• Session One - Water, Agriculture and Food Security, and Energy  
• Session Two - Health, Human Settlement and Disaster Risk Reduction  
After each session’s presentations, followed a panel discussion that gave opportunity to sector panelist to 
hear inputs and answer questions from other participants. It allowed a very healthy participation from all the 
representatives that were present. In  line with the guest of honor’s words to the participants: “I encourage 
you to analyze all priority sectors and the climate challenges our country faces and ask as many questions 
as needed to address them” . The panel discussions that followed the section p resentations were so engaging 
and participants analyzed the information given and gave suggestions that were needed. The discussions 
further gave the participants an opportunity to share and compare notes within and across sectors.  
Day two started with the presentations of session two of the previous day thereafter, the participants were 
then set up in Breakaway Groups (BaGs) aimed at streamlining thematic climate change priority sector 
discussions and preparing inputs into the devel opment of the NFWWCS.  
Five Breakaway Groups (BaGs) were eventually formed in accordance with the priority climate change 
sectors participating in the workshop and Each BaG nominated one chair and one rapporteur. The human 
settlement sector, fell out due to lack of participants in the sector.  
The BaGs’ overall objective was to come up with the priority needs of the country in climate services to 
support effective climate risk management and adaptation. As a guideline, they were to identify climate 
change disasters that were experienced by the sector and how they were dealt w ith or managed. Secondly, 
come up with Weather, Water and Climate services that will be useful for managing climate risks and enabling 
better climate disaster preparedness and response and thirdly, the development of the sector action plan.  
3.1. SECTOR PRESENTATIONS  
Presentations were written by institutions that were earlier selected from each sector and presented by their 
representatives. They were to give an overview of the national sector -based climate -sensitive user landscape 
focusing on the impact of climate cha nge on the sector.  
3.1.1. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE WATER SECTOR  
Climate data requirements for water resources (Chizya Mvula - WARMA)  
The presentation highlights the four mandates of WARMA as to: regulate water utilization, water quality, 
water quantity; manage water planning, water assessment and flood forecasting; develop identification and 
Page 11:

protection of potential freshwater sources and conserve, protect and preserve water dam s, wetlands, 
quarries, marshlands and head waters.  
It further gives the WARMA data stations covering the main water bodies in Zambia and the data products 
the institution produces. Then lists the sector’s requirements in terms of weather and climate data as well as 
capacity building.  
In conclusion, it states that:  
• Water resources monitoring is largely dependent on climate/weather data,  
• Improving the spatial and temporal resolution of climate products is critical to enhancing water 
resources information (water balance quantification & water allocation, flood forecasting & 
forecasting for future water availability/reservoir filling),  
• Enhancement of  Early Warning System  (EWS ) will lead to improvement in the accuracy of the issued 
alerts . 
3.1.2. THE IMPACT O F CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY SECTOR  
(Department of Agriculture)  
The Eighth National Development Plan (8NDP) 2022 – 2026 recognizes agriculture as one of the key sectors 
to achieving economic transformation and job creation in the Country. Most of the agriculture production in 
Zambia is by subsistence farmers (70%) who are dependent on rain fed agriculture.  The presentation points 
out that out of about 523,000 ha of land suitable for irrigation, currently about 200,000 ha of these (38%) are 
equipped for irrigation and under large scale farmers while the small scale farm ers remain at the mercy of 
climate variability and climate change.  
The presentation then focuses on the impacts of weather variability and climate change in Zambia that leads 
to: 
• Increased crop failure( Crop suitability shifting more and more to Agro ecological region III)  
• Reduced availability of irrigation water (underground and surface water)  
• Increased pests and disease outbreaks  
• Reduced pastures for livestock  
• Reduced production and productivity  
All put together puts of lot of stress and pressure on food security and the livelihoods of vulnerable 
communities.

3.1.3. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON T HE ENERGY SECTOR  
Overview of the energy sector in Zambia (Agnelli Kafuwe – Ministry of Energy)  
This presentation brought in another dimension of impacts of weather variability and climate change. With 
inter-seasonal rainfall variations, water for power generation reduced resulting in reduced power generation 
from the national hydropower stations. Po wer load -shading came in. The presentation demonstrates how 
reduced generation from hydropower stations triggered an increased consumption of charcoal and Liquified 
Petroleum Gas  resulting  with a reduction in household electricity demands.  It did not stop at households 
changing their types of energy use but further stimulated the government to revise energy Sector policies in 
2019.  
It concluded that the energy sector has not been spared from the adverse effects of climate change. 
Developing a diversified energy mix in the energy production portfolio will help reduce the dependence on 
hydro generation which is vulnerable to climate ch ange. It is imperative that climate change adaptation and 
mitigation measures are to be undertaken for a viable and sustainable energy sector.  
3.1.4. THE IMPACT O F CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE HEALTH SECTOR  
(Ngala Florence – Ministry of Health)  
The Health sector is vulnerable to climate change as the accompanying changes in climatic conditions affect  
human health directly or indirectly, leading to illness and death from extreme weather events, such as 
drought, storms, floods, temperature change , the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and 
food-, water - and vector -borne diseases.  
Zambia has a National Health Adaptation Plan (HNAP) which  is a health sector -oriented  climate change -
related  plan which addresses issues of the effects of climate change on human health, as a result of 
interactions of environmental, social and health system conditions. It is further a fulfillment of the obligations 
under the United Nations Framework Convention o n Climate Change (UNFCCC) and it’s inputs to the 
National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The overall objectives of the HNAP are to provide a broad framework for 
the health sector:  
• Mainstream climate adaptation in the health sector;  
• Strengthen the development and availability of evidence, building the data and reducing knowledge 
gaps, and inform relevant policies  
The health sector further highlighted its Climate change actions as follows:  
• Project on reducing UPOPs and mercury use in HFs. Introduced non -incineration methods - aimed 
at reducing carbon emissions  
• Conducted a Vulnerability Adaptation and Assessment (VAA) for climate sensitive diseases  
• Strengthened governance structures and promoting healthy cities concept

• Developed the Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP)  
The presentation listed the priority of its capacity building requirements as:  
• Logistics for the review of the National Health Adaptation plan  
• Development of Climate Change implementation guidelines  
• Development of Climate Change contingency plans  
• Training  at various levels in setting up early warning systems using climate change data  
• Training  in use of geographical data to map areas and predict  vulnerabilities to climate change  
In conclusion, climate variability and change is a major global health concern. Most of the outbreaks are easy 
to prevent, but the epidemic is becoming more out of control due to global warming and we need to take 
control of global warming not only for the  environment but for our lives.  
3.1.5. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON T HE HUMAN SETTLEMENT SECTOR  
(Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development)  
Human settlements are important because these are where the majority of the population live but some of 
them are in vulnerable places for example, areas prone to flash floods. The presentation labored to 
demonstrate how policies and regulations for human s ettlement in Zambia evolved with time to address 
challenges in the development of Human Settlements. In addition to other stresses on human settlements, 
climate change has not spared them, large and small, they are vulnerable to impacts that can be exacerb ated 
by direct climate changes (e.g., severe storms and associated riverine flooding) The following are highlighted 
as some of the impacts of climate variability and change:  
• Displacement due to flooding and droughts -some settlements are water -stressed  
• Increased intensity of winds thus blowing off roofs and destroying infrastructure  
• Failure in Agriculture leads  to increased rural -urban migration, further leading to unplanned 
settlements  
In terms of capacity building, the presentation goes for capacity building through their Local Authorities -City, 
Municipal , and Town Councils. They require Capacity Building skills to mainstream Climate Change data i n 
the Integrated Development  Plans  (IDPs).  
3.1.6. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON T HE DISASTER MANAGEMENT SECTOR  
Miyoba Musale (Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit)  
Zambia has experienced some climate variability and change -related  disaster effects  as a result of severe 
storms, floods, landslides, and prolonged dry spells. The presenter indicated that, DMMU projections shows  
Page 14:

WEATHER,  WATER  AND  CLIMATE  SERVICES  (NFWCS -ZM)  FOR  
ZAMBIA

that as of September, 2023, approximately 1.5 million people representing 17% of the population were 
exposed to hydro -meteorological hazards.  
Further, a list of sectors that are affected by disasters was given as:  
• Health and Nutrition - The outbreak of communicable and non - communicable diseases is evident 
due to flooding and extreme temperatures. The health system is usually overwhelmed with increased 
disease.  
• Agriculture and food security - Most of the people in Zambia depend on rain -fed agriculture and 
flooding may wash away crops. Prolonged dry spells and delayed onset of the rainy  season usually 
cause  crop loss resulting in a decrease in production resulting in food insecurity.  
• Livestock and fisheries - The livestock and fisheries sector are equally impacted by outbreaks of 
diseases, displacement , and loss of livestock. The pasture for livestock in most cases equally 
diminishes  due to prolonged dry spells.  
• Human settlement and Shelter - The houses made of fragile materials (mud and poles ) are highly 
affected by floods due to compromised structural integrity.  
• Infrastructure - Extreme flooding usually affects  various critical infrastructures  such as health centers, 
schools, water points, sanitation facilities, roads, culverts , and dams. Some areas become 
inaccessible due to washed -away  bridges, culverts , and roads. Most of the infrastructure is not 
climate resilient, making it highly susceptible to extreme weather patterns.  
• Education - The education sector experiences increased absenteeism of school -going  children due 
to, among other reasons destruction of school infrastructure like blown -off roofs. Some schools may 
also become inaccessible during the rainy season because of surging rivers forcing learners to stay 
away from school. In cases where there is food insecurity, school -going  children , especially the girl 
child may be more vulnerable to the impacts of flooding.  
• Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) - Water sources such as boreholes and shallow wells as 
well as pit latrines are usually flooded. This usually results in outbreaks  of waterborne  diseases. Dam 
infrastructure for drinking water also collapses especially those that were built a long time ago. Most 
households in flood -prone  areas, usually have challenges accessing  clean water for domestic use.  
To improve community preparedness and resilience to climate variability and change disasters, the sector 
recommended the following capacity -building  programs:  
• There is a need for communities to be equipped with knowledge of early warning systems and how 
to operate them  
• Training programs on first aid and emergency response  
• Training of Satellite Disaster Management Committees (SDMCs) in weather analysis and 
interpretation

ZAMBIA  
  
 
15 
 
• Training in resilience -building  programs especially in agriculture and infrastructure, in communities 
which are disaster -prone . 
In its recommendations and conclusion, the presentation advocates for the inclusion of (i) disaster risk 
reduction as a core feature of sustainable development and adaptation to climate change in all sectors, and 
undertake awareness -raising to change public perceptions to see disasters as preventable; (ii) undertake 
awareness -raising in disaster risk reduction as an essential element of strategies and (iii) enhance early 
warning systems to inform the relevant authority and population on time for quick decis ion making.  
3.2. REPORTS FROM BREAKAWAY GROUPS (BAGS) 
Breakaway sector groups began meeting in the afternoon of day 2 and concluded in day 3. BaG lead ers were 
asked to give feedback  after every session for discussion with all participants. Below are the reports from the 
BaGs.  
3.2.1. WATER SECTOR BREAKAWAY GROUP  
The water sector breakaway group built their discussion on the happening of (e.g. 2018, 2021 , and 2022) 
recent years when severe storms resulted in flash floods that affected both rural and urban settlements , 
contamination of drinking water , and outbreak of water bone diseases. The sector is sensitive to climate 
variability and change with critical consequences to human society as a result of events such as droughts, 
floods and long -term water resources may end up in destruction  to ","8140"

Background  
FARA, as a continental organization, has been leading the strengthening of the Knowledge 
Ecosystem agenda for the African Agricultural Research and Innovation Institutions (FARA, AFAAS, 
CCARDESA, CORAF & ASARECA) over the past years. This aim is to build synergies, deliver on our 
mandates and sustain the gains made.  As part of this wider collaboration, DSpace was identified by 
the CAADP -XP4 Consortium members and experts as a very robust tool for the integration of Library 
resources within these institutio ns.  
Recognizing the leadership roles and experience that ILRI has taken convening and building the 
CGIAR-wide ‘CGSpace’ platform on DSpace, there is strong interest to convene an initial scoping and 
design exercise to share experiences and help formulate a ‘ro admap to DSpace’ and project for the 
CAADP -XP4 Consortium.  
Meeting objectives  
1. Expose CAADP -XP4 Consortium members to DSpace and the CGSpace collaboration, sharing 
practical insights and lessons as well as strategic choices and options that were followed.  
2. Develop a joint outline and ‘road map’ to establish a joint repository of CAADP -XP4 
Consortium information and knowledge products and assets.  
3. Agree collaboration priorities and modalities to link the new repository with CGSpace and 
draw in relevant CGIAR expertise via ILRI and partners. 
 
Meeting outputs  
The main product from the meeting was an outline for an ‘ Africa Agri-Knowledge explorer and 
repository ecosystem ’ that could serve the shared goals of the partners and advance the wider 
science, innovation and transformation agenda of the continent.  
Preamble 
Transforming and sustaining African food, land and water systems is a complex challenge. Knowledge is a critical enabling factor for healthy agri-food innovation systems, m aking science 
accessible to stakeholders, validity of different knowledge systems and f ostering collaboration. It 
requires different stakeholders working together using spaces for them to share their knowledge, 
expertise and experiences ; to facilitate this, knowledge management will be essential.  
 
Building on existing high -level collaborations such as  
• The High -Level Consultative Forum on Strengthening Africa's Agricultural Research and 
Innovation in the Context of the CGIAR Reforms”  
• Action Plan for the Operationalization of the Abidjan II Communique  
• The joint implementation of the CAADP -XP4 -CGIAR-AUC MOU on KM Partnership 
Framework  
 The joint KM Working group of the Africa Agricultural Research and Innovation Institutions (AARII) 
i.e FARA, AFAAS, ASARECA, CCARDESA, CORAF, NAASRO a s well as  RuFORUM and AATF and the 
CGIAR represented by ILRI, IITA and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT agree to

collaborate to implement a shared, value -adding project to expose and highlight and communicate 
Africa’s rich  agricultur e and food system knowledge .  
 
This will be achieved through a shared knowledge ecosystem that facilitated inter -operability, is 
based around a DSpace repository that drives and powers diverse organizational knowledge hubs as 
well as a joint continental knowledge explorer that gives acc ess to the knowledge resources of the 
partners as well as, potentially, others.   
Project vision  
Make Africa Agricultural knowledge and Innovations available, accessible, inter -operable and usable 
through a sustainable knowledge ecosystem on inclusive and resilient Food Systems leading to a 
healthy and food secure continent . 
 
Project strategy  
Develop and implement a one-stop -shop  digital ‘explorer’ and repository  for continent -wide 
agricultural knowledge and innovations for Africa , based on shared:  
• Human resources  
• Technical expertise  
• Infrastructure  
• Financial resources  
• Opportunities of available Knowledge hubs  
• Lessons from CGSpace

Participants brainstormed budget components to prepare and launch the project by July 2024, with 
the following elements.  
Note – this is estimated as the ‘development’ phase; once the system is up and running and 
workflows are established, we assume the individual partners will budget their own content

How does climate exacerbate root 
causes of conflict in  Ethiopia ?
Climate Security Pathway Analysis
PHOTO J. VAN DE GEVEL_BIOVERSITY INTERNATIONAL
This factsheet gives answers on how climate exacerbates root causes of conflict in Ethiopia, using a climate security 
pathway analysis. Two main pathways are identified: 
1. Livelihood and Food Insecurity: The majority of Ethiopia’s land is vulnerable to climate extremes, which affect 
the availability of food. Local hotspots of food insecurity in the Tigray, Somali and Afar regions correlate with a 
higher occurrence of conflict, making them prone to climate security risks. Vulnerability to climate and conflict 
also differs along gender and age lines, while pastoralist livelihoods are particularly affected by the compounded 
pressure of climate effects and political marginalization. Natural disasters and biophysical changes have led to 
the displacement of people, adding to the large number of internally displaced people due to conflict, which are 
leading to further tensions with host communities in the areas of refuge.
2. Resource Access and Availability: Climate variability and extreme events are putting pressure on Ethiopia’s 
natural resources of land and water. This is leading to an increase in conflict rooted in resource competition, 
particularly in border regions. These conflicts, particularly those around land, exacerbate ethnic violence between 
communities as they vie for territory and power within the context of ethnic federalism. Complicating matters 
further are conflicts arising between pastoralists and farmers over different land use options, including the 
transition towards large-scale farming and conservation programmes. These affect the availability and accessibility 
of pasture and water. Conflicts around water manifest at local, national and international levels. Such conflicts can 
concern issues related to access to water at boreholes, unequal distribution of water among industries and rural 
communities, as well as national water security among the riparian countries of the Nile River Basin.Niklas Sax, Gamal Mohamed Hassan, Abdimajid Nunow Abdi, Tanía Ferrè Garcia, Ignacio Madurga-Lopez,

Climate Security Observatory Series: Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIA1. CONTEXT
Climate Profile 
Ethiopia is characterised by its climatic and topographic heterogeneity. Conditions vary from semi-
arid desert in the northeast, east and southeast lowlands to high rainfall and high humidity in the 
south and southeast equatorial rainforests (UNFCCC 2015). The country has a significant degree of 
inter-annual variability, characterised by three rainy seasons: June to September (‘kiremt’), October to 
January (‘bega’) and February to May (‘belg’), the first accounting for 50 to 80 percent of total annual 
rainfall (UNFCCC 2015). Mean average temperatures range from above 25 °C in the lowlands to below 
15 °C in the highlands (UNFCCC 2015). Since 1960, average temperatures have risen by 1 °C, particularly 
from July to September, with a 20 percent increase in the number of hot days (WBG 2021). Similarly, 
there has been up to a 20 percent decrease in rainfall during the spring and summer seasons in areas 
situated in south and central Ethiopia between 1950 and 2010 (UNFCCC 2015). Due to highly variable 
precipitation patterns, there has also been a pronounced increase in heavy rainfall events (UNFCCC 
2015). Projected future trends indicate an increase in extreme climate events, such as droughts and 
floods (UNFCCC 2015). Recent floods in several regions of the country, particularly in Somali, affected 
240 000 people (ECHO 2023). Meanwhile, Ethiopia continues to suffer one of the most severe La 
Niña-induced droughts in recent decades, with four consecutive failed rain seasons since late 2020 
affecting more than 8 million people, mostly in the southern and southeastern parts of the country 
(OCHA 2022; IOM 2023).
Future projections of rainfall and temperature patterns in Ethiopia remain highly uncertain (FDRE 
2011). Climate models point to an increase in temperatures ranging between 1.5 °C and 3 °C by 2050 
(UNFCCC 2015). In the case of rainfall, there is greater uncertainty as to whether or not it will increase 
or decrease, as estimates range from increases of 30 percent to possible declines of up to 25 percent 
(FDRE 2011). Overall, rainfall projections indicate a reduction in rainfall (from minus 30 to minus 50 
mm) in eastern parts of the country from the southeast to northeast, with southern regions suffering 
the greatest declines, ranging from minus 50 to minus 100 mm (UNFCCC 2015). Reductions of more 
than 150 mm per year during the belg and kiremt rainfall seasons are expected to strongly impact 
the southern and western areas of the Somali and Oromia regions, characterised for being the most 
densely populated and largest crop growing areas in Ethiopia (UNFCCC 2015). 
Conflict and Fragility 
Never colonized and ruled by successive emperors until 1974, Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries 
in the world (UCDP 2022). Its political and conflict history and present realities are shaped by relations 
between its heterogeneous ethnic groups, as well as challenges imposed by the complex interplay 
of climatological and topographic conditions. Long droughts induced by El Niño events, like those in 
1972-73 and 1982-83, have led to famines that contributed to ethnic rebellions, political turmoil and 
radical changes of government (Comenetz and Caviedes 2002). Consecutive droughts in the mid-
1974s triggered social unrest that was used by the pro-Soviet Marxist-Leninist military junta known 
as the ‘derg’, to overthrow the regime of emperor Haile Selassie (Comenetz and Caviedes 2002; UCDP 
2022). The even more devastating famine of 1984-85 stemmed from a combination of drought and 
military counterinsurgency that denied food aid to Tigray and used food as a major element of a 
strategy to combat secession movements, with devastating effects on the population (de Waal 2018).

Climate Security Observatory Series : Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIAThe derg’s mismanagement of the 1984-85 famine and loss of international credibility due to their 
mishandling of relief aid contributed to their fall in 1991 (Fullerton Joireman 1997; ICG 2009).
Ethiopia’s diverse population comprises more than 70 ethnolinguistic groups, many of whom have a 
long history of separatist sentiment and interethnic conflict (UCDP 2022). The unitary  imperial state 
(1930 to 1974) and the Marxist derg regime (1974 to 1991) both aimed to maintain ethnic cohesion 
by promoting nation-building with the arms of the state (Yusuf 2019). Numerous opposition groups 
– including the Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF), Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), Eritrean 
People’s Liberation Front (EPLF), and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) – joined forces to 
coordinate military efforts and organise offensives to overthrow the derg regime (Fullerton Joireman 
1997). From 1976 to 1991, Ethiopia was in an intra-state conflict on various fronts. Tensions with Somalia 
over ideas of a “Greater Somalia”, as well as marginalization of the Somali region within Ethiopia, led 
to the Ogaden War in 1977-78, which Ethiopia won with the help of the Soviet Union, but grievances 
of Somali-speaking peoples in Ethiopia remain (Nkaisserry 1997). Eritrea’s long war for independence, 
fought since 1961 to break out of the then Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea under the Ethiopian 
crown, finally saw victory in 1991 when the EPLF defeated the Soviet-backed Ethiopian army and took 
control of Eritrea´s capital Asmara, paving the way for an independent Eritrea (Lyons 2018). The fall of 
the derg regime in 1991 culminated in the rule of the Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic 
Front (EPRDF), a broad political movement dominated by the TPLF and characterised by ethnic-based 
opposition parties and a decentralised constitution with a commitment to federalism (ICG 2009; 
UCDP 2022). Among Ethiopians there remains no consensus concerning the effectiveness of ethnic 
federalism, particularly because under TPLF rule it had been grafted onto a history of centralised 
statecraft that worked to undermine disparate elements of self-rule within the federation (Yusuf 2019; 
ICG 2019). A major conflict faultline remains within Ethiopian politics and society, revolving around 
the level of autonomy given to ethnic groups, which needs to find a balance between opposing 
sentiments of Ethiopian nationalism and ethnic nationalism (Yusuf 2019).
From mid-2010, competing ethno-nationalism led to a weakening of party and state structures, 
leading to intensified ethnic mobilisation (Yusuf 2019). After four years of street protests, and following 
the resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn, the EPRDF elected Abiy Ahmed Ali as prime minister, (ICG 
2019; UCDP 2022). The new political dispensation under Ahmed Ali came at the cost of bringing 
long-simmering conflicts, which had been under the tight 27-year grip of the EPRDF, to the surface 
(Yusuf 2019). Inter-communal violence significantly increased from November 2020 due to a dispute 
between the federal and TPLF leadership, which escalated into civil war, mainly concentrated in the 
northern Tigray region (ICG 2022a). In November 2022, following peace negotiations sponsored by the 
African Union, both parties signed the Pretoria Deal, initiating a reconciliation process focused on the 
facilitation of humanitarian aid delivery and protection of civilians (ICG 2022b; UNICEF 2022).
 
Socio-Economic Profile
Situated in East Africa, Ethiopia is sub-Saharan Africa’s second-most populous state (UNFCCC 2015). 
Production in the primary sector of agriculture is key to Ethiopia’s economy, contributing around 44 
percent of the national GDP, 73 percent of employment and 90 percent of total export earnings, linked 
to the commercialization of livestock products: skins and hides, coffee as well as pulses and seeds 
(CIAT and BFS/USAID 2017; CGIAR 2018). Agriculture is the sector most vulnerable to the impacts of 
Page 5:

Climate Security Observatory Series: Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIAclimate change, as it is predominantly dominated by small-scale subsistence farmers dependent on 
rain and traditional technology (CIAT & BFS/USAID 2017; CGIAR 2018; WBG 2011). The negative effects 
of climate change on the national economy are expected to reduce GDP by up to 10 percent by 2045 
(UNFCCC 2015). Likewise, Ethiopian agriculture is predicted to decline by 6 to 32.5 percent between 
2030 to 2050, making the country more dependent on food aid (Belay et al. 2021). Combined with 
declining soil fertility and lack of financial resources to adopt technologies, increased pressure over 
natural resources, mainly driven by a growing population and food demand trend, is one of the biggest 
challenges faced by the agricultural sector (CIAT & BFS/USAID 2018). Further compounding the 
challenges faced by the country, population growth has exacerbated Ethiopia’s land tenure system, 
characterised by state ownership of land, leading to increased insecurity of tenure and fragmentation 
of landholdings (FAO 2021a).  
While unemployment rates remain low (3.4 percent) and food consumption has improved in recent 
decades, poverty and food insecurity remain a problem in the lowlands,  as well as in the pastoral 
and drought-prone highlands (FAO 2021a; WB 2021). Recent survey data indicates that 68.7 percent 
of the total population in Ethiopia is multidimensionally poor (UNDP 2022). The prevalence of food 
insecurity across the country remains high and figures indicate one in every three children under 
five years old is undernourished and, even in wetter, more favourable times, up to 10 per cent of 
households still experience food insecurity and rely partly on food aid (FAO 2021b; FAO 2016; ODI 
2015). Access to food remains limited, with figures indicating 48 percent of household budgets are 
spent on food and only 14 percent of roads are paved (CIAT & BFS/USAID 2017). In 2022, prolonged 
drought, together with conflict and cholera outbreaks, severely undermined household food security, 
leading to a deteriorating humanitarian situation with 29.7 million people in need of assistance and 
4.51 million people internally displaced (UNICEF 2022).  
2. CLIMATE SECURITY PATHWAYS 
Ethiopia is ranked 161 out of 182 nations by the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) 
Climate Vulnerability Index for 2022, indicating current vulnerability to climate disruptions. Climate 
variability and extreme events are exacerbating inter-communal competition over natural resources 
and are having detrimental effects on rural livelihoods, which both contribute towards violent conflict 
in the country. The connection between climate and conflict are being identified through the I) 
Livelihood and Food Insecurity Pathway, and the II) Resource Access and Availability Pathway.
The identified pathways represent logical mechanisms of how the climate-security nexus may 
operate in Ethiopia, based on an approach combining: I) systematized search and interpretation of 
existing understanding in academic and grey literature; II) verification of identified linkages and key 
points of discussion emerging from the “IGAD–CGIAR: Climate Vulnerability and Impact Pathway 
Analysis Workshop” with participation by several governmental and non-governmental stakeholders 
from Ethiopia (March 2023, online).

Climate Security Observatory Series : Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIAThe majority of Ethiopia’s land is vulnerable to climate extremes, which affect the availability 
of food. Local hotspots of food insecurity in the Tigray, Somali and Afar regions correlate with a 
higher occurrence of conflict, making them prone to climate security risks. Vulnerability to climate 
and conflict also differs along gender and age lines, while pastoralist livelihoods are particularly 
affected by the compounded pressure of climate effects and political marginalization. Natural 
disasters and biophysical changes have led to the displacement of people, adding to the large 
number of internally displaced people due to conflict, which are leading to further tensions with 
host communities in the areas of refuge.PATHWAY #1: Livelihood and Food Insecurity
Agriculture constitutes a crucial role in Ethiopia, with around 85 percent of the population living in 
agrarian areas relying on agricultural production to sustain their livelihood (Zewudie et al. 2021). The 
major crops grown in the country are teff (22.9 percent of crop area / 16.8 percent of grain production), 
maize (16.9 percent / 26.8 percent), sorghum (14.8 percent / 16.2 percent), wheat (13.3 percent / 15.8 
percent ) and barley, which together form the core of Ethiopia´s agriculture and food economy, 
accounting for around three-fourths of the total cultivated area (Evangelista et al. 2013; Taffesse et 
al. 2011; Yang et al. 2020). Even though most arable land is already used for agriculture and Ethiopia 
being one of the largest cereal producers in Africa, it is not self-sufficient and needs to fill the large 
gap remaining between crop production and domestic demand with high investments in food 
imports (Zewudie et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2020). Given Ethiopia´s diverse geographic, topographic and 
climatologic conditions, climate variability has different agricultural impact in different regions. As 
a general contrast, in water-abundant western Ethiopia crop yields are positively correlated with 
solar radiation and maximum temperature, while yields are negatively correlated with these factors 
in water-scarce eastern and southeastern Ethiopia, with the correlation between crop yields and 
precipitation showing the opposite pattern (Yang et al. 2020). Ethiopia is extremely exposed to the 
impacts of climate change and variability, with close to 90 percent of its surface area is vulnerable 
to severe or extreme climate stress and nearly all of the country’s agriculture dependent on rainfall 
(Pacillo et al. 2021; Evangelist et al. 2013). Effects of climate impact on agricultural production within 
the three rain seasons are diverse and pose several further implications.
The most prevalent drying trends can be witnessed in the belg season, due to a reduction in rainfall 
and temperature-induced soil drying (Temam et al. 2019). Agriculturally the belg season is important 
to grow the staple crop teff as well as for long-cycle crops such as corn and sorghum, with drought 
in this season having profound implications for food security (Temam et al. 2019). Aside from drought 
induced by a lack of rain, Ethiopia also experiences what is known as ‘green famines’, which describes 
unfavourable seasonal shifts in rainfall patterns leading to crop failure due to disruptions in the critical 
germination periods (Evangelist et al. 2013). Teff is strongly affected by climate change, with future 
distribution changes and yield reductions leading to an average loss of about 24 percent of the 
current suitable cropping area by 2050 (Kiambi and Yao 2014). Given the estimation that ‘enjera’, a food 
staple made from teff, provides up to two-thirds of food consumed in Ethiopia, this has considerable 
implications for food security (Zewudie et al. 2021). The already huge deficit between teff production 
and national demand are further exacerbated by the effects of climate change and population growth, 
leading to increases in the price of Ethiopia´s staple food (Zewudie et al. 2021). 
Page 7:

Climate Security Observatory Series: Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIAThe main rain season, kiremt, which is dependent on location of the intertropical convergence zone 
(ITCZ), is important for the main season ‘meher’ cultivation period, when most crops are grown (Temam 
et al. 2019). Here also, worrying trends both from rainfall declines as well as seasonal warming, are 
found in most parts of the country and pose a threat to the production of cereal crops such as barley, 
teff and wheat (Temam et al. 2019). Particularly during El Niño years, summer rainfall in some parts of 
the country is low, which has often led to food security crises (Lewis 2017). Extreme drought conditions, 
like that in 2015 during an El Niño event, affect the crop health of barley, corns, millet, sorghum and 
wheat (Qu and Hao 2018). The reduction in crop production caused by these  extreme events amplifies 
existing stress on food insecurity and imposes significant demographic, social, economic, physical 
and psychological challenges on households that rely on agriculture for their livelihood (Gebre and 
Rahout 2021). Erratic crop production caused by unpredictable and unfavourable rainfall and other 
shocks is combined with the steady growth of human population and an increasing demand for food 
(Mekuria et al. 2018). Different exposure to drought between regions of Ethiopia suggests that the 
availability of food is not the only factor for food insecurity, as drought incidents are, in many cases, 
local (most often reported in Tigray, Afar and Somali), while national cereal production during the 
same years has been stable, suggesting challenges in the distribution of food (Lewis 2017). 
Effects on cash crops, such as coffee, further impacts the economic livelihood of farmers as well as 
the national economy in general. Coffee contributes to around one-quarter of Ethiopia’s total export 
earnings and its cultivation provides a livelihood income for around 16 percent of the population (SCIP 
2017). Rapidly increasing temperatures in Ethiopia are destroying coffee plants at an alarming rate 
and land suitable for the prominent Arabica coffee is projected to reduce by 65 percent due to climate 
change (Iscaro 2014). Some of the current growing areas are already poorly suited for the cultivation of 
coffee and are markedly impacted by climate change. However, substantial areas that were previously 
unsuitable will become suitable under current climate projections, which would make assisted 
migration to new areas a key component for ensuring the resilience of Ethiopia’s coffee economy, 
as existing adaptation options for smallholder coffee farmers are overburdened (SCIP 2017; Eshetu 
et al. 2021). As coffee production is decreasing, many farmers are choosing to grow ‘khat’ (a mildly 
psychoactive leafy shrub) as a cash crop to generate income (IGAD-CGIAR 2023). 
The bega season, while having the lowest amount of rainfall compared to the other two seasons, is 
crucial for on-farm soil moisture as well as for maintaining grasses in rangelands (Temam et al.  2019). 
Projected drought intensification rates of 10 percent per decade will have devastating impacts on 
both farmers and pastoralists (Temam et al. 2019). With more than 80 million head, Ethiopia has the 
largest livestock population in Africa (Gashaw et al. 2014). Changes in temperature and patterns of 
rainfall indirectly affect livestock through factors such as feed availability, grazing ranges, feed quality 
as well as directly due to heat stress and disease incidents (Gashaw et al. 2014). Rhodes and buffel 
grasses remain the most suitable species for forage grass production under future climate scenarios, 
but Ethiopia has a negative feed balance and cannot meet future feed demand as land availability 
for natural pasture has been substantially decreased in favour of agricultural land (Brychkova et al. 
2022). Most livestock production is already located in marginal lowland ecosystems, where climate-
induced disasters, such as increasingly recurrent drought, floods, erratic rainfall patterns and high 
temperatures add significant stress on viable grazing areas, making pastoral communities highly 
Page 8:

Climate Security Observatory Series : Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIA“vulnerable to these disaster risks (Gashaw et al. 2014). Decision-makers are sometimes unaware of the 
specific challenges faced by pastoralists in Ethiopia in achieving and maintaining their livelihood, due 
to there being only a few mechanisms for local communities to transmit their knowledge (Chinasho 
et al. 2017). Pastoral systems have over centuries gone through cycles of coping and adaptation 
to extreme weather condition in semi-arid lands but the fragility of their systems becomes more 
apparent in severe droughts when crop failure and massive livestock death lead to famine, such as in 
the early 1970s and 1980s (Gebeyehu et al. 2021). 
“Climate change is affecting each and every sector, especially the livelihood sector with food 
security, but also education, health and everything fundamental to human wellbeing. Most of 
our people are living in rural areas, and the current drought is affecting people, livestock and 
nearly all regions. Many have lost their livelihood and are moving to IDP camps or towns.”
(IGAD-CGIAR Workshop participant 2023)
Livelihoods are threatened by major droughts and floods that reduce agricultural productivity, 
decrease food availability and increase food prices (Milman and Arsano 2013). The impact of climate 
change on rural livelihoods becomes visible through a decline in crop yield, diminishing livestock 
productivity, livestock and human disease outbreaks, reduction in water availability and conflict over 
resource competition (Mihiretu et al. 2021). In addition to the impact of climate variability on food 
security, droughts and floods disrupt transportation and other infrastructure, leading to a loss of 
household assets and negatively affecting the Ethiopian economy (Milman and Arsano 2013). Drought 
frequency is coupled with other environmental challenges, such as land degradation, deforestation 
and loss of biodiversity (Mekonen and Berlie 2021). Household vulnerability is increased due to low 
education level, limited infrastructure and lack of access to the enablers of adaptive capacity, such 
as information, technology or economic resources (Mihiretu et al. 2021; Mekonen and Berlie 2021). 
Land in Ethiopia is allocated by the state to farmers but as almost all land is occupied, scarcity of 
arable farmland and landlessness are increasing, particularly in the highlands (Yigezu Wendimu 
2021). The fragmentation of small farmlands through inheritance by children further increases 
household poverty, leading to greater food insecurity and vulnerability, particularly of youth who have 
to rely on decreasing land quantity and quality (Yigezu Wendimu 2021). Ethiopia has made strong 
commitments to strengthen its social protection system and support to food insecure households 
through: 1) boosting agricultural productivity; 2) assisted resettlement on voluntary basis; 3) income 
diversification; and 4) employment creation offering credit access to poor households. However, the 
programme faces significant challenges in implementation (Lemma and Cochrane 2019). Climate 
change and variability compounds these existing socioeconomic risks connected to food security, 
which generates insecurities over multiple dimensions of poverty, inequality, agricultural productivity, 
conflict and crisis exposure (Pacillo et al. 2021). 
In the local hotspots of Tigray, Afar and Somali, the persistent dry climate conditions co-occur with 
moderate to severe conflicts and different socioeconomic vulnerabilities, making them the regions 
most exposed to climate security risks (Pacillo et al. 2021). Discontent with food prices, exacerbated 
by insufficient rainfall, encourage citizens to challenge authorities through protest, particularly in 
already historically marginalized communities in the regions of Oromia, Somali and Afar (Yishak 2019). 
The governmental agenda to shift the economy away from an agricultural to a manufacturing base 
Page 9:

Climate Security Observatory Series: Climate Security Pathway Analysis ETHIOPIAhas gained little traction for most of the rural population and grievances have arisen against foreign 
investors and state-led projects that did not generate enough jobs (ICG 2019). The widespread poverty 
of the unskilled labour force who did not profit from Ethiopia´s impressive growth in GDP contributed 
to the buildup of protests in 2015 that led to further inter-communal violence in the following years 
(Yusuf 2019). Pastoralists are among the most affected by climate impacts, and are also one of the 
most disadvantaged groups regarding the provision of formal education. This significantly limits their 
participation in the labour market and lowers the opportunity to transition their livelihood (Debebe 
2016). Efforts to mobilize ethnic groups to protest and take part in violent confrontations in various 
parts of the country gained resonance among angry youth who are lacking opportunities in a still 
largely agriculture-dominated economy, which is heavily impacted by climate change (Yusuf 2019).
Livelihood and Gender
The impact of both climate change and conflict is not equally distributed across society and differs 
according to gender and age, among other factors. Ethiopia has a patriarchal society with gender 
norms biased in favour of men, though variations exist between different ethnicities (Mersha and 
Van Laerhoven 2016). Being two-thirds poorer, less educated, and mostly not involved in political and 
household decision-making, women are inevitably more vulnerable to climate impacts (Herman 
2016). Women are also more likely to be killed by climate-related hazards and experience hunger 
after such events, which is partly because they are culturally expected to eat only after they have 
fed their families (Devonald et al. 2022; Herman 2016). Furthermore, during times of drought, when 
mobility increases, gender-based violence increases (IGAD-CGIAR 2023). It has also been found that 
the barriers to adaptation in Ethiopia are much higher for women engaged in agriculture (Mersha and 
Laerhoven 2016). 
Restrictive norms against women ploughing leads to their de facto exclusion from reciprocal 
labour support systems. The reliance on sharecropping arrangements makes on-farm adaptations 
almost unattainable for female-headed households given their low bargaining power (Mersha and 
Laerhoven 2016). Conflict further affects women disproportionately, with an increased risk of violence 
during climate-related conflict and displacement and being highly insecure while collecting water or 
firewood (Devonald et al. 2022). Adolescents and youth are also highly vulnerable to climate impacts 
as climate-related hazards disrupt services needed for their long-term development and education 
(Devonald et al. 2022). Droughts can triple the time needed for the collection of water, and as fetching 
water is predominately a task of girls this can affect their ability to remain in school (Gemechu 2022). 
Youth are often also unable to voice their concerns and ideas in community discourses due to age 
barriers (Devonald et al. 2022). 
Livelihood and Mobility
Ethiopia’s population can be divided into the central highlands, where the majority live; the relatively 
unpopulated and arid south; and the northern and central areas with moderate population density 
(Comenetz and Caviedes 2002). Long droughts, especially those associated with El Niño events, have 
historically contributed profoundly to the distribution of Ethiopia’s population, both through voluntary 
migration and government responses to emerging famine-induced political crises. A notorious 
example of latter came in 1978 in the form of relocations to poorly planned and hastily implemented 
agricultural villages, which later became known as the first process of villagization (Comenetz and

Introducción  
 
Este reporte  tiene como objetivo informar sobre los resultados de trabajo derivados del primer Taller de 
Semillas Disruptivas, organizado del 17 al 19 de mayo, 2023 en Panajachel, Guatemala, como parte del 
Paquete de Trabajo No. 3 de la Iniciativa de CGIAR sobre Resiliencia Climática (ClimBeR). En primer lugar, 
el informe presenta un marco general para el enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas: ¿por qué se desarrolló?,  
¿de qué trata?  y ¿qué pretende lograr?  En segundo término, se presenta una descripción general de los 
antecedentes de la Iniciativa ClimBeR y del proyecto Semillas Disruptivas en particular. A continuación, 
el informe se enfoca en la metodología y el programa del Taller, brindando luego una descripción 
general de los resultados alcanzados. El informe finaliza con un recuento de los próximos pasos para el 
proyecto.  
 
1. Semillas Disruptivas : inspiración para la imaginación de futuros 
más sostenibles y justos  
 
Los desafíos ambientales globales que enfrentamos actualmente (degradación ambiental, pérdida de 
biodiversidad, inequidad y cambio climático en particular) exigen un cambio sistémico significativo y 
radical, es decir, transformaciones de sostenibilidad. Tales transformaciones implican inevitablemente 
un cambio de las estructuras de poder actuales e insostenibles a otras nuevas y sostenibles. Sobre la 
base del trabajo de Bennett et al. (2016), presentamos, en este sentido, un nuevo enfoque de escenarios 
que nos permite visualizar transformaciones de sostenibilidad y explorar el papel crucial de las 
dinámicas de poder: el enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas (Rutting et al. 2022). Dicho enfoque fue 
desarrollado en respuesta a la necesidad de un enfoque novedoso para pensar en el futuro, que  
enfatiza elementos “esperanzadores” y se concentra en iniciativas que desafían activamente -desde sus 
fundamentos - a las estructuras y prácticas insostenibles e injustas vigentes, para generar escenarios 
creativos, desarrollados de abajo hacia arriba.  
 
Usamos el término ´ semillas ´ como una metáfora para referirse a iniciativas sociales, tecnológicas, 
económicas o socio -ecológicas que existen, al menos en forma de prototipo, y desafían activamente o 
muestran una alternativa para prácticas  insostenibles o injustas, y representan a una diversidad de 
cosmovisiones, valores y regiones, pero que no  son dominantes en este momento . Estas semillas tienen, 
sin embargo, el potencial de crecer en términos de impacto y eventualmente de reemplazar prácticas y 
estructur as insostenibles, pudiendo de esta manera, ser consideradas como potenciales promotores del 
cambio transformacional. Aunado a eso, dichas semillas pueden representar perspectivas y visiones de 
mundo que difieren en sus fundamentos de los marcos dominantes a nivel mundial, a menudo 
originados en el Norte Global. Esto último es clave por dos motivos. En primer lugar, las perspectivas y 
visiones de mundo que desafían el marco dominante pueden ofrecer formas alternativas de abordar los

5 retos globales antes mencionados y ayudar a romper los bloqueos o “puntos muertos”. En segundo 
lugar, ayudan a que los procesos de toma de decisiones sean más justos y equitativos.  
 
2. La iniciativa ClimBeR de CGIAR en R esiliencia C limática  
 
El proyecto Semillas Disruptivas se lanzó en el año 2022 como parte de la iniciativa Resiliencia Climática 
(ClimBeR por sus siglas en inglés)  de CGIAR. ClimBeR  es una de las iniciativas de la nueva cartera de 
investigación del CGIAR que aportará ciencia e innovación para transformar los sistemas alimentarios, la 
tierra, y el agua frente a una crisis climática. ClimBeR trabajará en Guatemala y otros cinco países, con el 
fin de aumentar la resiliencia de los sistemas de producción de los pequeños agricultores para soportar 
los graves efectos del cambio climático, como las sequías, las inundaciones y las altas temperaturas.  
La variabilidad y los extremos climáticos están teniendo un impacto significativo y adverso en los países 
de ingresos bajos y medios, y este impacto no hará más que empeorar. Los sistemas alimentarios y 
agrícolas se enfrentan a un riesgo especial, con amenazas de pérdidas económicas y de empleo e 
incertidumbre en las inversiones. Los pequeños agricultores, y en particular las mujeres y los jóvenes, se 
han visto afectados en sus esfuerzos por mejorar sus medios de vida, mientras que la pobreza y las 
tensiones sociales aumentan.  
La demanda se ha desplazado desde la comprensión de los impactos del cambio climático hasta el 
diseño de innovaciones y la dirección de los flujos financieros para alcanzar objetivos ambiciosos en 
materia de clima y sistemas alimentarios. Las soluciones de adaptación deben ir más allá de la 
tecnología y tener en cuenta también las consecuencias sociales, medioambientales y económicas: las 
intervenciones aisladas ya no son suficientes. En Guatemala, estas soluciones de adaptación son 
necesarias para hacer frente a las amenazas de los impactos de los fenómenos meteorológicos 
extremos, como las sequías y las altas temperaturas. Trabajar para asegurar la transformación a nivel de 
sistema mejorará la resiliencia, la productividad y la equidad. Trabajando en estrecha colaboración con 
los socios a nivel local, nacional, regional y mundial, el enfoque audaz y único de ClimBeR aborda la 
vulnerabilidad al cambio climático en sus raíces utilizando un marco de adaptación transformadora. El 
trabajo se basa en la trayectoria del CGIAR en materia de investigación agrícola para el desarrollo, que 
incluye diez años de trabajo sobre el cambio climático y la agricultura en el marco del Programa de 
Investigación del CGIAR sobre el Cambio Climático, la Agricultura y la Seguridad Alimentaria (CCAFS), con 
actividades centradas en las siguientes áreas:  
1. Reducción del riesgo para los medios de vida de los productores y las cadenas de valor  
2. Comprender los riesgos de seguridad relacionados con el clima e identificar los caminos hacia la 
paz 
3. Garantizando que los formuladores de políticas tengan la evidencia necesaria para desarrollar 
políticas urgentes, holísticas y específicas del contexto  
4. Desarrollo de capacidades para el desarrollo de políticas que reúnan las necesidades locales y las 
herramientas disponibles para permitir la gobernanza hacia la resiliencia

6. Garantizar la equidad de género y social

3. El Proyecto Semillas Disruptivas  
 
Como un enfoque innovador, el proyecto Semillas Disruptivas complementa otros paquetes de trabajo 
de ClimBeR e inicitiavas de CGIAR, compartiendo el foco en la agricultura climáticamente inteligente, y 
el empoderamiento de comunidades marginadas, mujeres y jóvenes. En este proyecto, combinamos el 
enfoque de ´ semillas ´, que esencialmente es un enfoque de visualización y retrospectiva, con un 
enfoque de escenarios exploratorios de una manera innovadora. El Proyecto consta de cuatro fases 
principales:  
1. La identificación de semillas disruptivas en Guatemala  
2.  El desarrollo de rutas de desarrollo transformativo para el sistema agroalimentario, enfocado 
particularmente en la seguridad y soberanía alimentaria de grupos vulnerables ante la 
variabilidad climática y los eventos extremos, especialmente mujeres, jóvenes y comunidades 
rurales campesinas empobrecidas  
3. El desarrollo de un conjunto de escenarios exploratorios sobre el futuro de Guatemala para 
tomar en cuenta la incertidumbre a futuro (tanto sociopolítica como relativa al cambio 
climático)  
4. Una prueba de robustez de las rutas de desarrollo transformativo utilizando escenarios 
exploratorios para hacerlos más robustos frente a la incertidumbre futura  
En la primera fase se identificaron las semillas disruptivas y otras semillas con capacidad transformadora 
en Guatemala a través de búsquedas en línea, así como a través de la participación y consulta con 
agentes clave, medios de comunicación, y organizaciones nacionales e internaciones en Guatemala. Los 
criterios de selección de semillas disruptivas eran que las semillas se centran en la agricultura sostenible; 
que desafían activamente el régimen agrícola vigente (centrado en la producción, monocultivos, 
dominado por multinacionales, descuidando los valores y prácticas locales/regionales y los aspectos 
ecológicos); y tienen potencial transformador. Con estos criterios, se desarrolló una base de datos de 
más de cincuenta semillas disruptivas en Guatemala. Posteriormente, se utilizó una serie de criterios 
adicionales para priorizar las Semillas que podríamos invitar a participar en el proyecto, siguiendo las 
siguientes preguntas:  
- ¿Desafía la semilla las estructuras de poder actuales?  
- ¿Ofrece alternativas más justas o sostenibles a los sistemas o prácticas actuales? (¿Proporciona 
ideas para la transformación?)  
- ¿Apunta (in)explícitamente a nuevas formas de gobernanza o cambio institucional?  
Page 7:
 
 
7 - ¿Está relacionado con los sistemas alimentarios o la nutrición?  
- ¿Está enfocada en mujeres?  
- ¿Está enfocada en jóvenes?  
- ¿Está liderada por o enfocada en pueblos indígenas?  
- ¿Está activa en áreas geográficas vulnerables ante la variabilidad climática y eventos extremos?  
La fase 2 se centra en e l desarrollo de las rutas de desarrollo transformativo para el sistema 
agroalimentario de Guatemala, y está descrito en este informe.  
Más adelante, en la fase 3, nos alejaremos de los futuros deseables, es decir, de la pregunta ""¿qué 
queremos que suceda?"" , y nos centraremos en los futuros posibles (""¿qué podría pasar?"" ). Con este fin, 
utilizamos un enfoque de escenarios exploratorios.  
Finalmente, en la fase 4, reuniremos los resultados de las fases 2 y 3. Esta última fase del proyecto se 
centra en la pregunta: ¿serían exitosas las vías de transformación en una variedad de escenarios futuros 
diferentes, cada uno de los cuales ofrece diferentes desafíos y oportunidades?  
 
4. Objetivos y programa del taller  
 
1. Co-crear rutas de desarrollo transformativo para el sistema agroalimentario de Guatemala 
basadas en semillas disruptivas. Estas rutas serán usadas para orientar la planificación y las 
inversiones a corto, mediano y largo plazo de organizaciones gubernamentales y /o no 
gubernamentales.  
2. Apoyar el fortalecimiento de semillas disruptivas en Guatemala, a través de la facilitación de un 
espacio de intercambio entre las personas representantes de éstas.  
 
Durante este primer taller, nos enfocamos en desarrollar vías de transformación generadas por agentes 
clave. Se invitó a una variedad de partes interesadas, principalmente representantes de Semillas 
Disruptivas de organizaciones de base, así como organismos no gubernamentales, medios de 
comunicación, actores del sector privado, actores gubernamentales, de investigación y  organizaciones 
internacionales . 
En relación al segundo objetivo del taller, se organizó un figurativo ´Mercado de Semillas´, donde 
representantes de Semillas presentaron lo que tienen para ofrecer a otras organizaciones presentes en 
cuanto a conocimiento o experiencia (oferta), y lo que necesitan para desarrollarse o crecer (demanda). 
De esta manera, el taller fue el inicio de un proceso para apoyar el fortalecimiento de las Semillas 
Disruptivas a través del intercambio de experiencias, experticia y conocimiento entre ellas.

5. Metodología del taller  
 
El enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas es, en esencia, un enfoque de visualización y retrospectiva, que tiene 
como objetivo imaginar futuros esperanzadores para, posteriormente, proporcionar orientación al 
desarrollo de un camino o una ruta política hacia tales futuros. El enfoque se basa en la premisa de que 
las transformaciones hacia la sostenibilidad probablemente no sean procesos de transición suaves. Los 
actores dominantes que se benefician del sistema actual ejercerán poder en defensa del status quo, y 
las semillas de cambio transformador tendrán que desafiar de alguna manera a estos sistemas y actores 
dominantes. Con este fin, incorporamos conocimientos clave de la literatura sobre dinámicas de poder y 
cambios de transición/transformación (Avelino 2017, Brisbois 2019, van Rijnsoever y Leendertse 2020, 
Feola et al. 2021, ver tabla 1). Este enfoque renovado, al que llamamos enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas, 
es un enfoque de investigación acción participativa (IAP), en el que los participantes contribuyen a la 
construcción nuevos conocimientos y colaboran en pequeños grupos que representan diferentes 
sectores, disciplinas, perspectivas y grupos de interés (Rutting et al. 2022).  
 
El enfoque consta de dos pasos principales: el primer paso es imaginar un futuro en el que una semilla 
disruptiva en particular se haya vuelto dominante y, por lo tanto, parte de un nuevo régimen. Durante 
este paso, los participantes pensarán en cómo se vería la semilla en su forma madura (es decir, cuando 
se haya vuelto dominante), así como lo que esto significa para el mundo en el que existe esta semilla: 
¿Quiénes son los ganadores y los perdedores de este mundo futuro en particular? ¿Qué otros impactos 
Page 10:
 
 
10 tendría esto?  Usaremos la denominada “Rueda del Futuro” para pensar en tales repercusiones (ver 
figura 1).  
 
 
 
Figura 1.  Ejemplo de una Rueda del Futuro que representa impactos de primer orden y ganadores y perdedores de 
una semilla en su forma madura  (en el centro)  (Rutting et al, 2022) . 
 
El segundo paso es explorar y explicar cómo se llevarán a cabo los cambios de poder necesarios para la 
transformación del actual régimen vigente al futuro visualizado durante el paso 1. Durante este segundo 
paso, el Modelo de Tres Horizontes (ver figura 2), que es una forma sencilla de visualizar las 
transformaciones, se utiliza para guiar la reflexión y discusión entre las personas participantes. Más 
importante aún, formulamos un conjunto de preguntas basadas en la literatura sobre 
transiciones/transformaciones de poder, que buscan ayudar a articular cómo se pueden desarrollar 
realmente tales transformaciones. Estas preguntas fomentan a hacer explícito cómo ocurren los 
cambios de poder (ver tabla 1).

transformaciones y hacerlos explícitos (Rutting et al, 2022)  
Preguntas atinentes al régimen  Preguntas atinentes a las semillas  
¿Cuáles son los elementos clave y las

dominante (régimen) deben desaparecer? 
(basado en Feola et al. 2021)   ¿Qué conflictos deben surgir para que estas partes 
insostenibles del régimen se vayan?  
¿Cómo se pueden desarticular estos elementos y 
estructuras asociados al régimen actual?  
¿Cómo ejerce y refuerza el régimen actual su 
poder?  ¿Qué estrategias utiliza para defenderse a 
sí mismo o a sus estructuras?  ¿Cómo ejerce la semilla su poder de transformación? 
¿Existen estrategias para desestabilizar el régimen? 
¿Qué recursos se utilizan o necesitan?  
¿Cómo puede este poder transformador alterar las 
estructuras del régimen actual?  
¿Qué macrotendencias están alineadas con el 
régimen?  ¿Cómo desafía la semilla a las macrotendencias 
dominantes?  
¿Cómo fortalece la semilla a las macro -contra 
tendencias? ¿Existen sinergias?  
¿Qué grupos de actores están alineados con el 
régimen?  ¿Qué grupos de actores se alinean con la semilla?  
¿Cómo se organizará la gente de las semillas? ¿Quién 
los apoyará? ¿Cuáles son los roles de los actores 
relevantes?  
¿Cómo se defenderán contra el cambio los 
actuales actores dominantes? ¿Cómo trabajarán 
para inhibir a la semilla?  ¿Cómo perturbarán o alterarán el régimen actual los 
actores alineados con la semilla?  
¿Cómo utiliza el régimen herramientas discursivas ¿Cómo utilizan herramientas discursivas los actores 
Page 12:
 
 
12 tales como medios de comunicación?  alineados con la semilla?  
¿Emplea el régimen la coerción o la 
manipulación? ¿Quién hace lobby por el régimen 
y cómo?  ¿Cómo se puede lograr el cambio ""ajustándose a las 
reglas"" del régimen?   
Preguntas generales: ¿Cómo ocurre este cambio de poder? Describa las luchas de poder y los cambios: 
¿cómo pasamos de la situación actual a la visión del mundo en la que la semilla es dominante? ¿Hay 
puntos de inflexión?  
 
Abordar estas preguntas proporciona importantes componentes para el desarrollo de un escenario 
futuro que describe el proceso de transformación del sistema actual en el presente hacia uno alternativo 
y sostenible en el futuro. Esto, a su vez, informa a la formulación de vías o rutas políticas de 
transformación. La combinación del enfoque de Semillas Disruptivas con la planificación de escenarios 
exploratorios puede ayudar a que tales vías o rutas políticas sean más robustas frente a la incertidumbre 
futura.  
En resumen, la metodología diseñada para el taller de Semillas Disruptivas en Guatemala  consta de 
cuatro pasos:  
1. La creación de una visión a futuro de la semilla en su forma madura: Este primer paso se centra 
en imaginar cómo se verían las semillas concentradas e n una t emática en su forma madura; 
cuáles impactos tienen en este mundo a f uturo; y quié nes son los ganadores y perdedores del 
nuevo régimen sostenible y justo.  Esto se visualiza en una ´ rueda del futuro ´ 
2. La creación de las rutas de desarrollo transformativo. Este segundo paso se centra en analizar 
cómo llegar a ese futuro, es decir, cómo sería la transformación y qué cambios de poder deben 
ocurrir para que la semilla se vuelva dominante y florezca como parte del nuevo régimen. Las 
rutas se crean de la siguiente manera:  
a. Para analizar a fondo el desarrollo transformador que es necesario, en primer lugar las 
personas participantes contestan una serie de preguntas sobre el régimen  injusto e 
insostenible establecido, y otra serie de preguntas sobre la Semilla Disruptiva, y cómo 
muestra alternativas al régimen .  
b. Luego, las respuestas a estas preguntas facilitan la formulación de  las rutas de desarrollo 
transformativo , cuales son visualizados en una línea de tiempo, y descritas en una 
narrativa. Adicionalmente, se usa el Modelo de Tres Horizontes  para guiar las 
discusiones.  
c. Finalmente, cada grupo de trabajo define objetivos de política  que pueden ayudar a 
realizarse la ruta de transformación. En esencia, se trata de un proceso de visualización y 
retrospectiva: en primer lugar, se evoca una visión de futuro deseable con base en las 
semillas y, en segundo lugar, se construye la trayectoria hacia este futuro en base a un 
proceso de razonamiento retrospectivo hacia el presente.  
3. El paso 3, posteriormente, se centra en identificar las sinergias entre las diferentes rutas de 
transformación. Esto se hace en plenaria, después de que cada grupo temática haya presentado 
su trabajo.

13 4. En el paso  4, finalmente, las personas participantes definan los planes, las estrategias y 
políticas  que pueden beneficiarse de las rutas de desarrollo transformativo.  
 
6. Resultados del taller  
 
Mercado de Semillas  
 
Al inicio del taller se organizó un figurativo ´Mercado de Semillas´, en que personas representantes de 
las organizaciones presentes (llamadas ´ Semillas Disruptivas ´) anotaron y presentaron lo que tienen para 
ofrecer a otras organizaciones presentes en cuanto a conocimiento o experiencia (oferta), y lo que 
necesitan para desarrollarse o crecer (demanda). De esta manera, el taller fue el inicio de un proceso 
para apoyar el fortalecimiento de las Semillas Disruptivas a través del intercambio de experiencias, 
experticia y conocimiento entre ellas.  
En este ejercicio los participantes notaron que hay muchísimo conocimiento y experticia para compartir, 
para así ayudarse y fortalecerse entre las Semillas Disruptivas. También se mencionó la necesidad de dar 
seguimiento posterior al taller al mercado de semillas, para asegurarse que las participantes estén 
conscientes de las posibles conexiones entre ellas; exploren cómo se pueden apoyar; y que el proyecto 
ClimBeR a su vez facilita estos intercambios y el escalamiento de sus iniciativas. Finalmente, los 
organizadores del taller también mencionaron que investigarán y comunicarán cuales necesidades en 
conocimiento pueden ser apoyadas a través de iniciativas de CGIAR presentes en Guatemala.

Through AGNES's collaboration with NTV Kenya, indigenous youth in Kenya (males and females) and CEMIRIDE were broadcasted on NTV's Earthwise Live Programme to discuss the role of indigenous youth in climate change. CEMIRIDE also presented VoC at a workshop organized by the Kenya Ministry of Environment and Forestry to provide input into the Third National Climate Change Action Plan. CEMIRIDE plans to intensify use of VoC for advocacy work across all its programmes. The lesson learned is that local voices are powerful, and where community members are not able to be present, technologies like video or audio are powerful representations.

Priority Goals
This provides opportunities to showcase and promote nature-based solutions (NBS) informed by
indigenous peoples' beliefs, value systems, and ways of knowing. This is critical because food security
and human rights of indigenous peoples, including pastoralist, forest, and fisher communities must be
protected, promoted, and always enjoyed and all places. the food systems approach provides a
comprehensive and holistic perspective on agriculture and food security in line with paragraph 14 (a) of
the SSJW on the implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security which underscores
that the joint work should aim at “promoting a holistic approach to addressing issues related to
agriculture and food security”. This  workshop provided a platform for indigenous peoples’ representatives to outline their priority
needs to input into Third National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP, 2023-27) that is led by the
Ministry of Environment and Forestry through the Climate Change Directorate. An accelerated
programme of the finalisation has targeted the government launch of the NCCAP 2023-2027 at the
Africa Climate Summit, in Kenya, in September 2023. 
The representatives of indigenous peoples, who included a representation of women, youth, and
persons with disabilities, at the meeting for 3rd and 4th August 2023, discussed their experiences
about environmental justice and its cross-cutting aspects within the 7 sectors. This discussion is
geared towards generating data that will inform the development of the NCCAP 2023-27 and influence
policy positions including the upcoming Africa Climate Summit, the UNFCCC processes and the
national climate change policies and initiatives. This meeting provided opportunities for translating
constitutional & policy gains in recognition of indigenous knowledge systems and practices related to
climate change into meaningful programs and actions at the county and country levels.
The NCCAP 2023-2027 provides a welcome opportunity to mainstream ownership and access rights
for indigenous communities, for them to effectively engage in sustainable livelihoods. This will
contribute to the country being able to meet other rights like the right to food, across a bigger section
of the population, considering that indigenous peoples are more than 20% of Kenya’s population.
Indigenous Peoples interventions seek to contribute to the four-year Sharm el-Sheikh Joint Work
(SSJW) on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security, especially by pushing for
the food systems approach, ensuring sustainability and hence deliver food security and nutrition for all
(especially indigenous peoples, including the disadvantaged gender groups), without compromising the
welfare of future generations through harmful economic, social, and environmental practices.

BACKGROUND
Intervention Summary
Indigenous People with disabilities at the NCCAP workshop
Page 3:
Indigenous peoples’ organised participation in the on-going development of the National Climate Change Action
Plan 2023-27 is of critical importance. These communities occupy areas that are most sensitive to climate change,
and being totally natural resource dependent for their livelihood, they are disproportionately affected by climate
change impacts. This is because climate change presents an added burden to them as they already disadvantaged
socially, politically, and economically by the fact that they are marginalised. Comprising of about 20% of the
Kenyan population, according to the most recent 2019 census, it is, therefore, imperative that any planned
decision likely to affect their livelihoods should include their priorities, views, dreams, and aspirations. Climate
change response is one such decision
The objectives
Ensure placeholders and anchors for the
promotion and application of indigenous
knowledge in climate change programming and
actions are integrated into the NCCAP 2023 - 27
Contribute towards operationalisation of
constitutionally guaranteed rights and affirmative
action principles in access to climate finance for
IPs ... ensuring those with the least Carbon
footprint, most negatively impacted by climate
change are safeguarded against further impact
and support for enhanced resilience/adaptation.  
Ensuring the legislative and policy gains with
respect to indigenous peoples’ representation and
consultation in decision-making arrangements
related to climate change include in the National
Climate Change Council, national oversight board
for REDD+, IPs action plan in REDD+ and FPIC are
integrated into the NCCAP.1.

Expected Output 
The output for this workshop is the Draft National
Climate Change Action Plan with inputs from the
indigenous communities. 
Expected Outcomes 
Indigenous people should with deep understanding of their roles
Voice out IP concerns through a public participation in the NCCAP process
An engagement for climate information, engagement,, and inclusion 
A partnership between the Kenya Human Rights Commission with CEMIRIDE Importance of indigenous peoples in the NCCAP process. 
Their participation is also envisaged under the
Constitution of Kenya 2010 as well as the Climate
Change Act of 2016. Indigenous people’s voices are,
therefore, critical in ensuring success of intervention
measures as well the needs, perspectives and
experiences they bring on board through their
indigenous and local knowledge.
“Indigenous peoples’ voices
are critical in revitalizing
traditional knowledge and
technologies in agriculture ,
bio diversity conversation,
and natural resource
management, which is key
to attaining climate
resilience” Nyang’ori
Ohenjo, CEMIRIDE

action through NCCAP to secure Indigenous Peoples'
Livelihoods- StellaMaris Mulaeh(Fasternaktion)
Key message
Indigenous Peoples' interaction with food systems,
has proved a dynamic innovator and co-creator for
knowledge for all humanity. Indigenous peoples
generate hundreds of food items from the
environment without depleting natural resources
and achieve high levels of self-sufficiency.
Enhance, protect and restore indigenous food ways
Continuous updating of knowledge on traditions, cultural systems and practices, including
rotational farming, gathering, fishing, trapping, food gardens and cultivation.Pastoralism and biodiversity
 Genetic Level: Pastoralists often rely on locally adapted livestock breeds and crop varieties that can resist
disease outbreaks, drought, and other pressures, including climate change.
Species Level:  By retaining species and management practices that have evolved in parallel with the local
environment, pastoralists retain important species interactions (e.g. herbivory, host-parasite, and nutrient
cycling), which benefit many wild species of plants, birds, and insects.
Ecosystem Level:  Many ecosystems have evolved because of interactions with grazers. For example,
pastoralism maintains a patchwork of habitats including open areas, which are important for nesting birds.
Furthermore, livestock are important contributors to food cycles.
 Traditional migratory and cross-border pastoralism: conservation of grazing territories and their utilisation
for meat, milk, fibre, fuel, and others
Core Principles in Climate Justice
• Self-determination
• Collective rights
• Gender equality
• Participation and inclusion
• Cultural rights
• Rights over lands and other natural resources

The Importance of Indigenous Voices in Climate Change Policy –
Nyang’ori Ohenjo 
Nyang’ori Ohenjo using the Voices for Change video explained why it was important to use documented
voices of indigenous peoples and their practices to influence policy discussions and negotiations in climate
change.
He noted that CEMIRIDE has partnered with CGIAR through IRRI, in its
Climber project to document the voices of pastoralists and forest peoples
on climate change, food security, and human rights, and these stories
were being used to communicate with policymakers. 
This was an interesting strategy since it provided the avenue for
communities to communicate more authentically, and with unadulterated
content to policymakers, drawing a more real picture of the situation,
especially where good practices that could be scaled up were concerned.
A video by Jane Chepkwony, on how she and her family navigated the
challenges of prolonged drought was shared. This story provides valuable
lessons about how indigenous knowledge and technology around
pastoralism can be adapted to design indigenous peoples' friendly
climate change adaptation programmes like pasture. He explained that in the current context where the impacts of climate change on IPs were intensifying, IPs
need to strengthen and diversify the strategies that they were using to reach out to critical audiences, to
secure their livelihoods (pastoralism, fisheries, and forest livelihood practices like beekeeping). 
Participants strongly related their experiences with the story of Jane. During the plenary discussion, many
participants expressed similarities between intensifying drought and reducing land spaces hence the need to
save the indigenous pasture seed and adapt other technologies like drought-resistant crops for enhancing
resilience to climate change impacts.

Climate Change Impacts
Kenya’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions represent less than
1% of total global emissions. 
Kenya's Economy is heavily dependent on climate-sensitive
sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, tourism, wildlife,
and health that are heavily impacted by climate change. 
The Economic Survey for 2017 reports that the economic cost
of droughts is estimated to create an average long-term fiscal
liability equivalent to 3% of GDP (equivalent to KES 230
billion per annum).
The floods in early 2018 claimed lives and displaced hundreds
of thousands. 
The flood was preceded by the 2014-18 droughts which were
declared a national emergency in February 2017 and affected

SUMMARY OF PRIORITY AREAS
Page 16:
WAY FORWARD
Strengthening the Engagement Framework to effectively voice the IPs' issues on Climate Change
deliberations in the national platform.
These are the agreed and adopted areas to be addressed in the NCCAP document to be
presented to the Directorate of Climate Change, Ministry of Environment, and Forestry
A recommendation was adopted to develop an indigenous word that is equivalent to the
word “Agroecology. 
Pastoralism was recognised as a livelihood in the country in 2007 but needs to be
supported in the national budget as an integral part of the economy.
The need to develop a curriculum for pastoralism through deliberate space in the NCCAP
document.
Capture the indigenous TIMPS
With the right there is political goodwill we need to see that the IDPs issue should be
included in all the 7 sectors/strategic objects of NCCAP 
That IPs should be on the validation table before the Plan is signed into operation. These  items listed were drawn from the strategic objects in the NCCAP 2017-2022.

Indigenous youth are agents of 
change for self -determination
The right of IPs to self -
determination occupies an 
important place in 
international human rights law
The United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of 
IPs 
UNDRIP Art 3  –the right to 
freely pursue their economic, 
social, and cultural 
developmentClimate action and the green 
transition
Education -not culturally 
appropriate, don’t value IK of 
IPs, misuse of ICT that 
stereotypes Indigenous ways of 
life,  the expansion of extractive 
and resource -exploitation 
companies that undermine 
Indigenous Peoples’ values and 
societies.
Indigenous youth are 
positioning Indigenous Peoples' 
unique alternative solutions to 
climate change and issues 
related to the ‘green transition’Mobilising for Justice
Many IP youth face multiple 
barriers, cultural clashes, & 
and different influences = 
acquire an identity that is 
foreign to their place of 
origin
Despite this IPs youths  
mobilizing to shift narrative 
around IPs = driving force for 
societal change through 
social mobilization, making 
use of online platforms to 
showcase and celebrate 
their cultures, languages, 
and knowledge systemsIntergenerational connections
Why Indigenous Youth 
it is important for 
intergenerational dialogue 
between youth and elders, 
because youth represent 
continuity.
As the keepers of traditional 
and scientific knowledge, elders 
hold the key to Indigenous 
Peoples’ cultures, values and 
cosmovision. Indigenous elders 
teach IP youth  and children the 
importance of family, 
community, nature, and their 
responsibilities within these 
structures

03Protection of Rights of Indigenous Communities in 
Climate Action Implementation to Achieve Food Security
Slide 1
❑Agriculture, CC & marginalization are strongly connected. CC impacts on 
agriculture disproportionately affect marginalized= more exposed to hazards.
Indigenous communities need access to and control over their assets = must 
participate in decisions concerning the use of natural resources and the 
policies concerning food systems.
❑Women, youth, as well as persons with disabilities in particular are often not 
granted their rights and find themselves excluded from participation in decisions 
that concern their daily lives.

Building on previous experience with climate services, ClimBeR and other stakeholders contributed to stakeholder engagement and baseline assessment activities for the formulation of the NFCS. Major sectors, key actors, and their roles within the climate services value chain in Guatemala were identified. The capabilities of the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (NMHS) were evaluated based on the delivery of climate information services to the country's different sectors, resulting in the identification of gaps and key elements for a plan of action to implement the NFCS.

 Implementación del Marco Nacional de Servicios Climáticos (MNSC), paso 11
Este texto documenta y sistematiza la información de fuentes oficiales nacionales 
e internacionales, los resultados del taller interinstitucional Capacidades de los 
servicios climáticos en Guatemala y la identificación de los actores que están 
involucrados en la cadena de los servicios climáticos, tales como proveedores, 
investigadores y usuarios. 
La parte analítica del informe Capacidades de los servicios climáticos en 
Guatemala se basa en el documento Directrices detalladas para la creación 
de un marco nacional para los servicios climáticos publicado en 2018 por la 
Organización Meteorológica Mundial, el cual describe los lineamientos para la 
puesta en marcha de la creación de un MNSC, y define las responsabilidades, 
acciones y vinculaciones de las partes interesadas a nivel local, nacional y 
regional. 
El MNSC es relevante para la sociedad, porque plantea cómo enfrentar los retos 
de los sectores sociales, económicos y ambientales que son más sensibles a las 
condiciones climáticas. Presta especial atención a los aspectos de salud, agua, 
agricultura, seguridad alimentaria y la reducción de riesgo de desastres.
Actualmente, en el contexto global, existen múltiples amenazas naturales y 
antrópicas que, al interactuar con la vulnerabilidad, incrementan el riesgo de 
que ocurran daños directos o indirectos en diversos sectores. Por lo tanto, se 
prevé una mayor demanda de servicios climáticos accesibles y precisos que 
satisfagan las necesidades de la población guatemalteca, principalmente, la que 
habita en las regiones más desamparadas y que aún no cuentan con cobertura 
de los servicios climáticos (Naciones Unidas [UN], 2018).
Según el Banco de Guatemala (Banguat, 2019), la agricultura, ganadería, caza, 
silvicultura, pesca y explotación de minas y canteras conforman el sector 
económico primario en Guatemala. Durante 2019 representó el 10.9 % del 
producto interno bruto (PIB) del país y creció el 2.3 %. Esto es importante 
para el MNSC, pues los principales usuarios finales de los servicios climáticos 
corresponden al ámbito agropecuario que depende directamente de las 
condiciones meteorológicas y de la variabilidad del clima.PRESENTACIÓN
Page 11:
El objetivo de este documento es presentar un panorama general sobre los 
avances de la creación del Marco Nacional de los Servicios Climáticos (MNSC) 
en Guatemala, a partir de lo cual, se asume el compromiso de promover el MNSC, 
de manera que sea funcional y permita el crecimiento de todos los sectores 
productivos relacionados con los servicios climáticos, que son sensibles a las 
condiciones del clima.
Finalmente, se reconoce que la elaboración conjunta del informe ha significado 
una gran experiencia para las instituciones participantes, ya que integra la 
visión de diferentes actores y representantes del sector. También se valora el 
aporte del Sistema Guatemalteco de Ciencias del Cambio Climático (SGCCC), la 
Universidad Rafael Landívar (a través del Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias 
Naturales y Tecnología, Iarna) y de la OMM, quienes han asistido y confiado en 
el equipo de autores de este documento.

Capacidades de los servicios climáticos en Guatemala El Instituto Nacional de Sismología, Vulcanología, Meteorología e Hidrología (INSIVUMEH) es 
una institución técnico-científica cuya misión es generar y difundir información que permita 
tomar mejores decisiones en las diferentes áreas del país, con el objetivo de garantizar que la 
información sea accesible y permita desarrollar estrategias de adaptación al cambio climático 
y fortalecer a los diversos sectores socioeconómicos.
El INSIVUMEH, en su papel de Servicio Meteorológico e Hidrológico Nacional (SMHN), se 
encuentra suscrito a la Organización Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) que, durante la Tercera 
Conferencia Mundial sobre el Clima, propuso la implementación del Marco Mundial para los 
Servicios Climáticos que tiene concatenación de objetivos con el INSIVUMEH.
La importancia a nivel mundial consiste en equipar a las instancias que toman decisiones en 
los diferentes campos socioeconómicos sensibles a los fenómenos meteorológicos y climáti-
cos para hacer uso eficaz de la información climática. En consecuencia, no solamente hay una 
necesidad urgente de reforzar la cooperación mundial para la elaboración de datos exactos y 
oportunos, sino también de intercambiar los mismos entre proveedores y usuarios de los ser-
vicios. Es necesario que los países se unan en un esfuerzo conjunto para mejorar la gestión de 
riesgos derivados de la variabilidad climática y el cambio climático mediante la incorporación 
de información sustentada científicamente en la planificación política, económica y de cada 
uno de los ejes sectoriales del país.
La visión de las autoridades del INSIVUMEH es brindar información confiable, efectiva y de 
calidad, que impacte positivamente a la población. 
Se invita a las instituciones de los diferentes sectores del país a participar en esta iniciativa 
que lleva por nombre el Marco Nacional para los Servicios Climáticos y que está orientada al 
cumplimiento con los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible (ODS), los compromisos con Nacio-
nes Unidas (NDC) y el Plan K´atun.
En el ejercicio de mis funciones, entregamos a los usuarios de los servicios y de la información 
climática de Guatemala, el primer producto para la implementación del Marco Nacional para 
los Servicios Climáticos, para contribuir a las metas institucionales planteadas, garantizando 
que los productos generados den sostenibilidad a la actividad productiva de los diferentes 
sectores y gestionar de forma preventiva la reducción de la vulnerabilidad ante fenómenos 
naturales.

Universidad Rafael Lanvídar
La Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Proyección (VRIP) es la dependencia de la Univer-
sidad Rafael Landívar (URL) encargada de definir y concretar la visión universitaria respecto de la investigación y la proyección, en búsqueda de una mayor y óptima sin-tonía con los procesos de educación formal e informal y de acción pública. Entre las unidades que conforman la VRIP se encuentra el Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias Naturales y Tecnología (Iarna), el cual cuenta con capacidades humanas, físicas,  finan-cieras y de información que le permiten desplegar su labor con sentido programático y con mirada de largo plazo. 
Dentro de los mecanismos que le dan soporte a la labor de investigación, educación y 
proyección del Iarna, destaca el Observatorio de Territorio y Clima (OTC). Esta inicia-tiva universitaria también se ha visto impulsada por el proyecto «Fortalecimiento de la resiliencia de los medios de vida ante el cambio climático en las cuencas altas del altiplano de Guatemala» auspiciado por el Fondo Verde del Clima bajo el liderazgo de la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (UICN).
El OTC ofrece soporte científico y tecnológico al objetivo de contribuir a la reducción 
de la vulnerabilidad de las personas y comunidades asociada a los sistemas de produc-ción agropecuaria, los recursos naturales y, en general, a la estabilidad de los medios de vida, frente a las amenazas derivadas de la variabilidad y el cambio climático. En este contexto, el OTC opera como un mecanismo de gestión de riesgo agroclimáti-co, dando seguimiento, analizando y haciendo síntesis rigurosas de fenómenos socio naturales, atendiendo a las escalas espaciales y temporales que los definen. Este pro-ceder se hace factible a partir de: (i) información climática e hidrológica histórica, (ii) pronósticos actualizados, (iii) conocimiento (científico y ancestral) sobre los cultivos, los sistemas productivos, las amenazas hidro climáticas y (iv) la interacción activa y adaptativa con los actores locales.  
Es bajo estas premisas y pautas de operación, que la URL-VRIP —a través del Iarna y 
el OTC— impulsa esfuerzos colaborativos concretos en el seno del Marco Nacional de los Servicios Climáticos (MNSC) que lidera el Instituto Nacional de Sismología, Vulca-nología, Meteorología e Hidrología (INSIVUMEH). El Iarna y el OTC, en consecuencia, dinamizan, desde los modos de proceder universitario, estas redes de trabajo colec-tivo, procurando gestionar el riesgo de manera rigurosa, en favor de las personas, las comunidades y los entornos donde desarrollan sus vidas.

Guatemala se encuentra suscrita a marcos 
y convenios nacionales e internacionales en 
materia de acciones de mitigación y adap-
tación al cambio climático y de la gestión 
del riesgo de desastres. Por lo tanto, es ne-
cesario recopilar el contenido de los servi-
cios climáticos y de las partes interesadas 
en el país; ello, con el fin de evaluar las ca-
pacidades de Guatemala en la prestación de 
los servicios climáticos, para reducir los pe-
ligros y maximizar potenciales oportunida-
des conectadas con el tiempo, el clima y el 
agua (Organización Meteorológica Mundial 
[OMM], 2017).
Este documento aporta una visión general 
sobre los avances para la creación del Marco 
Nacional de Servicios Climáticos (MNSC) en 
Guatemala. El marco analítico utilizado se 
basa en el texto Directrices detalladas para 
la creación de un marco nacional para los 
servicios climáticos (Organización Meteoro-
lógica Mundial y Global Framework for Cli-
mate Services [OMM, GFCS], 2018). Como 
resultado, en este material se documenta 
el proceso para dar cumplimiento al primer 
paso para la creación del MNSC en el país, 
para lo cual se llevó a cabo lo siguiente: 
1. Identificación de los actores involucra-
dos en la cadena de los servicios climáti-
cos: proveedores, investigadores y usua-
rios.
2. Documentación y sistematización de la 
información de fuentes oficiales nacio-
nales e internacionales. 
3. Resultados del taller interinstitucional 
acerca de las Capacidades de los Ser-
vicios Climáticos en Guatemala. La con-
vocatoria de participación fue dirigida a instituciones y a los sectores involucra-
dos en este contexto del MNSC. La diná-
mica del taller permitió obtener impor-
tantes aportes de los representantes de 
las entidades participantes.
4. Realización del foro sobre Servicios Cli-
máticos en Guatemala. El objetivo prin-
cipal de la actividad fue presentar los 
resultados obtenidos en el taller Capa-
cidades de los Servicios Climáticos en 
Guatemala, donde se tuvo amplia par-
ticipación interinstitucional relacionada 
con estos servicios; entre cuyos princi-
pales logros destacan: las nuevas formas 
de generar pronósticos meteorológicos 
y climáticos en Guatemala, la innovación 
en sistemas de monitoreo, la creación de 
la Academia Nacional de los Servicios 
Climáticos para el fortalecimiento de las 
capacidades de acción en cambio climá-
tico de los actores de los sectores pro-
ductivos del país, la implementación de 
las mesas técnicas agroclimáticas (MTA) 
en beneficio del ámbito agropecuario, 
investigaciones sobre los servicios cli-
máticos y el clima en curso, así como los 
planes de estudio de los servicios climá-
ticos en formación para los servicios de 
extensión nacionales.
Los resultados obtenidos permiten identifi-
car las capacidades para gestionar la infor-
mación y los servicios climáticos en Guate-
mala, así como las oportunidades de mejora 
en cuanto a investigación climática, cober-
tura territorial con la red de estaciones y la

Capacidades de los servicios climáticos en Guatemala Guatemala is subscribed to national and 
international frameworks and agreements 
on climate change mitigation and adaptation 
actions and disaster risk management, 
led by institutions that manage climate 
information to different actors and civil 
society. Therefore, it is necessary to collect 
information around climate services and 
stakeholders at the national scale, in order 
to assess the country’s capacities in relation 
to climate services, to reduce risks and 
maximize potential opportunities related to 
weather, climate and water (WMO, 2017).

SAPLING was part of the co development of the model. Tanzania’s Ministry of Livestock requested inputs for plans towards Building a Better Tomorrow, a national program for promoting entrepreneurship and employment for youth and women, given pilots tested and proven by SAPLING in the country. A collaboration framework for scaling the Women in Business model, among others, was developed.

1  Execu,ve summary Tanzania is poised to transform its livestock sector for beIer lives targe-ng its youth as beneﬁciaries and anchors for more widespread beneﬁts across society. This emphasis has been captured in the Building BeIer Tomorrow through Livestock and Fisheries Entrepreneurs (BBT-LIFE) Ini-a-ve. The transforma-on is pegged on having a more produc-ve, compe--ve, and sustainable livestock sector as outlined in the Tanzania Livestock Transforma-on Plan (2022). The desired produc-vity gains can be made by addressing primary causes of declining natural resource base, limited availability of high-quality feeds, inappropriate gene-cs as well as limited access to essen-al inputs and services for breeding, disease management, credit and working capital and extension services. The situa-on is further aggravated by the ongoing climate change emergency, which is resul-ng in frequent and more severe droughts and unpredictable weather paIerns.  The goal is to contribute signiﬁcantly to six new impact areas that Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MLF) has highlighted as key priori-es. The impact areas capturing challenges that are aligned to those in exis-ng roadmaps for the development of the livestock sector, as follows: 1) Climate adapta-on and mi-ga-on; 2) Environmental health and biodiversity; 3) Gender equality, youth, and social inclusion; 4) Nutri-on, health, and food security; 5) Poverty reduc-on, livelihoods, and jobs, and 6) Increased use of digital innova-ons. The emphasis on increased use of digital innova-ons can be seen as part of broader capacity building targe-ng the youth that MLF has emphasised as a way of working diﬀerently for beIer results across the ﬁrst ﬁve impact areas.   Besides championing exis-ng roadmaps for the livestock sector, the priori-es are also well aligned with the ﬁve impact areas that CGIAR 2030 Research and Innova-on strategy, and the Interna-onal Livestock Research Ins-tute (ILRI) current strategic objec-ves. The MLF championed priori-es therefore provide a perfect basis for collabora-on by actors across livestock research and development landscape in Tanzania to scale up proven innova-ons towards a more produc-ve, compe--ve, and sustainable livestock sector and achieving the impacts. The medium-term goal is to raise the contribu-on of the livestock sector from only 7% to about 10% of Tanzania’s GDP by 2030 and to unleash Tanzania’s huge poten-al to become a leader in livestock produc-on in Africa.  Working with relevant government agencies, MLF will promote the delivery and use of innova-on packages best suited for development of the livestock sector in Tanzania. It will strive to achieve impact through public-private partnerships (PPPs), networks, and complementary ins-tu-ons across livestock research and development. MLF will work closely with TALIRI and its partners including the Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) and the Interna-onal Livestock Research Ins-tute (ILRI) to up-scale science-based innova-ons. Projects will be co-developed to deliver evaluable beneﬁts. The projects will state quan-ta-vely what they intend to achieve and by when, and then work backwards to generate compelling theories of change, ac-vi-es, and resource requirements. A framework pegged on market systems approaches across priority livestock value chains and capacity development is proposed.

Target: 2000 BBT – LIFE enterprises over 5 years MLF, SUGECO, Mr Pig Tanzania Ltd, TALIRI, ILRI 3, 4, 5, 6 USD 3m Total USD 37m  MLF is commiIed to suppor-ng the involvement of research ins-tu-ons as an underpinning, cross-cukng driver, including improving the ins-tu-onal environment for development and transfer of technologies and innova-ons. A key area for engagement with research ins-tu-ons is in rela-on to monitoring and evalua-on of the scaling of the innova-ons. In addi-on, they may also conduct further research in development ac-vi-es across the interven-ons. Poten-al ques-ons for engagement with MLF and implemen-ng agencies across the interven-on areas are suggested as a star-ng point for enhancing the support that TALIRI and ILRI can provide to MLF. The research can be embedded as part of monitoring and evalua-on during scaling of the innova-ons.  1 The impact areas are as follows: 1) Climate adaptation and mitigation; 2) Environmental health and biodiversity; 3) Gender equality, youth, and social inclusion; 4) Nutrition, health, and food security; 5) Poverty reduction, livelihoods, and jobs; and 6) Increased use of digital innovations.

4  Introduc,on In recent years, the Government of Tanzania has priori-zed the transforma-on of the agricultural sector. The current priori-es are captured in the Agricultural Sector Development Program (ASDP II) that is designed to help meet the objec-ves set out in several exis-ng strategies and policies in the country. Despite accoun-ng for 11% of the African caIle popula-on and the second largest herds and ﬂocks in Africa, livestock related ac-vi-es contribute only about 7% to Tanzania’s GDP . This scenario largely reﬂects increases in livestock numbers, rather than produc-vity gains. The popula-on of dairy caIle is one of the fastest growing at an average of 5.3% per annum, while the rest of the sector is growing at half this rate.2,4   The low produc-vity challenge stems primarily from poor or inappropriate animal gene-cs, the decline in the natural resource base, characterized by the limited availability of high-quality feeds and the seasonality of rainfall. Furthermore, there is limited access to essen-al inputs and services for breeding, disease management, credit and working capital and extension services. Evidence from the most recent agriculture census shows declining access and use of inputs and services by livestock keepers in Tanzania, from 55% to only 9% of livestock keepers accessing extension services over the last decade3. Related analysis around the previous census by FAO and the Tanzania Na-onal Bureau of Sta-s-cs showed that users of livestock extension services aIain higher produc-vity and earn three -mes more income than non-users4. The absence of reliable markets for livestock and livestock products also discourages investments that could improve produc-vity. Rising demand for animal products in the country presents opportuni-es for improving livestock-dependent livelihoods and reducing imports of livestock source foods (LSFs). By 2031 demand for LSFs will outstrip supply about three -mes without interven-on5. There is also a growing domes-c and interna-onal market for livestock feed.  The situa-on is further aggravated by the ongoing climate change emergency, which is resul-ng in frequent and more severe droughts and unpredictable weather paIerns. The increasing natural resource degrada-on and compe--on for use of land resources between farmers and livestock keepers and resultant land use conﬂicts require immediate aIen-on. The climate crisis requires targeted adapta-ve and mi-ga-ve innova-ons that leverage the socio-economic and market drivers while also addressing the growing environmental and health eﬀects associated with livestock agri-food systems.   The Tanzania Livestock Master Plan (2018) and the Tanzania Livestock Transforma-on Plan (2022) provide roadmaps to overcome these challenges and develop the livestock sector. These documents set out livestock-sector investment interven-ons for beIer gene-cs, feed, health services and complementary policy support that could help meet the sector wide approach  2 Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, 2023.

New impact areas As part of prepara-ons to posi-on the livestock sector at the Africa Food Systems Forum (AGRF) September 2023 Summit and beyond, the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MLF) has highlighted six new impact areas capturing challenges that are aligned to those in exis-ng roadmaps for the development of the livestock sector as well as Sustainable Development Goals, as follows.  1. Climate adapta-on and mi-ga-on 2. Environmental health and biodiversity 3. Gender equality, youth, and social inclusion 4. Nutri-on, health, and food security 5. Poverty reduc-on, livelihoods, and jobs 6. Digital innova-ons  Increased use of digital Innova-ons can be seen as part of broader capacity building targe-ng the youth that MLF has emphasised as a way of working diﬀerently for beIer results. This emphasis has been captured in the Building BeIer Tomorrow through Livestock and Fisheries Entrepreneurs (BBT-LIFE) Ini-a-ve. Besides championing exis-ng roadmaps for the livestock sector in Tanzania, the priori-es are also well aligned with the impact areas that CGIAR 2030 Research and Innova-on strategy, and the Interna-onal Livestock Research Ins-tute (ILRI) current strategic objec-ves. These strategic objec-ves and impact areas represent the main drivers for the collabora-on between ILRI and other CGIAR organisa-ons with the Tanzania Livestock Research Ins-tute (TALIRI) and other partners in Tanzania. The MLF/TALIRI-championed impact areas therefore provide a perfect basis for collabora-on across livestock research and development actors in Tanzania about scaling up of proven innova-ons towards achieving the impacts. This working document outlines ini-al steps of this endeavour. The document will enhance collabora-on between MLF/TALIRI and ILRI in livestock research and development in Tanzania. The actors will forge the addi-onal partnerships needed to achieve the stated impacts. Ac-ng now, together and coherently, Tanzania can unleash its huge poten-al to become a leader in livestock produc-on in Africa and fulﬁl its ambi-on to feed the world with ﬁrst class proteins. Delivering beneﬁts across the impact areas Working with relevant government agencies, MLF will promote the delivery and use of innova-on packages best suited for development of the livestock sector in Tanzania. It will strive to achieve impact through public-private partnerships (PPPs), networks, and complementary ins-tu-ons across livestock research and development. On enhancing the use of science-based innova-on, MLF will work closely with TALIRI and its partners including the Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) and the Interna-onal Livestock Research Ins-tute (ILRI) to up-scale science-based innova-ons that include the use of appropriate animal gene-cs, herd health prac-ces and social sciences and solu-ons including the use of digital innova-ons that enhance delivery of innova-ons to livestock keepers.

6  Capacity development ac-vi-es will include working closely with local government authori-es (LGAs), banks, agripreneurs and organiza-ons to improve the u-lity of technological, and ins-tu-onal solu-ons. Ac-vi-es will include working with both LGAs and agripreneurs as training-of-trainers to promote the delivery of bundles of inputs and services at the farmer level and ongoing ins-tu-onal support. Capacity development will also include embedding formal training opportuni-es in the implementa-on of collabora-ve research for development projects.  MLF will also support business strategies, ins-tu-onal arrangements, and investment programs, together with more formal public policy sector instruments. The aim will be to help the public and private sectors to improve the enabling business environment for scaling of innova-ons, par-cularly to reach disadvantaged communi-es, women, and youth. Ac-vi-es will include engagement in dialogues on public policy and private sector strategy at all levels, e.g., at the AGRF 2023 Summit. The broad steps towards delivering beneﬁts across the impact areas through the sustainable use of livestock are summarised in Table 1.   Table 1. Delivering beneﬁts across the impact areas Impact area  Delivering the impacts  Climate adapta`on and mi`ga`on Promote prac`ces for livestock keepers to enhance their adap`ve capacity while reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) through promo`on of climate-smart forage varie`es, beber feed u`liza`on, and provision of aﬀordable and accessible climate-informed services, par`cularly using digital tools. Environmental health and biodiversity Promote biodiverse livestock systems including a livestock gene-bank to reduce risk of biodiversity loss, and a circular economy to maximize the synergies between livestock and the environment across all livestock systems. Gender equality, youth, and social inclusion Promote interven`ons to encourage entrepreneurship, ﬁnance, enable equal access to innova`ons, use of digital tools and capacity development services for women and young people to enable them to shape livestock systems in line with the aims of Tanzania’s Building a Beber Tomorrow - Livestock and Fisheries Entrepreneurs (BBT-LIFE) - Youth Ini`a`ve  Nutri`on, health, and food security Promote use of produc`vity enhancing technologies in livestock management to increase the supply of livestock source foods to improve nutri`on, manage zoono`c diseases, food safety, and an`-microbial resistance. Poverty reduc`on, livelihoods, and jobs Produce more with less inputs by promo`ng solu`ons for strengthening compe``veness and resilience, including oﬀ-taker linkages that improve income-genera`ng opportuni`es and sustainability of smallholder livestock farming and through specializa`on in any stage of the value chain par`cipa`on, with a focus on women, disabled and youth.  Increased use of digital innova`ons Promote use of digital tools to improve delivery of beneﬁts across the above impact areas as a key part of capacity development

7  Implementa,on mechanisms Projects of varying sizes would be co-developed, with addi-onal partners where needed, to deliver evaluable beneﬁts in all six impact areas. The projects will state quan-ta-vely what they intend to achieve and by when, and then work backwards to generate compelling theories of change, ac-vi-es, and resource requirements. The projects would come with evaluable results frameworks and clear repor-ng of results against investment. A framework pegged on market systems approaches across priority livestock value chains and capacity development is proposed, along with examples of how various ac-vi-es highlighted by MLF would ﬁt into the framework towards a more produc-ve, compe--ve, and sustainable livestock sector in Tanzania to contribute to the impact areas (Table 2).

Sustainable pasture and fodder farming; on-farm faIening for red meat produc-on e.g., TALIRI Malya goats   Promo&ng digital innova&ons  MLF is keen to make the digital revolu-on central to its way of working, leveraging the rapid global spread of digital technologies to change how livestock food systems innova-on is done using the best tools available. MLF will support the engagement of digitally empowered agripreneurs and end-users to improve their access to and use of innova-ons and knowledge. For instance, research 
Page 11:
  
8  has shown that use of mobile phones enhances microﬁnance businesses linked to farmers. A key area that MLF will promote is the engagement with the private sector and development partners on the promo-on of cross-talking digital plamorms and use of digital solu-ons to improve access and the use of inputs and services especially breeding and extension services. Digital innova-ons have been shown to be aIrac-ve for youth engagement.  Promo&ng partnerships with the private sector  Recognizing that the private sector is essen-al to sustainable livestock food system transforma-on, MLF will build interdependent rela-onships with small, medium, and large enterprises. This will include private sector coali-ons, to accelerate sector-wide progress across priority livestock value chains and projects. Examples of how private sector involvement will be promoted is provided in Box 1.  Box 1. Examples of how private sector involvement will be promoted. Private sector collaboration is crucial in achieving economic growth. In the livestock sector, promoting private sector involvement in sustainable and inclusive livestock value chains development is essential to improving the efficiency and competitiveness. Governments can play a critical role such as creating an enabling business environment. MLF through its Private Sector Desk will facilitate sharing of information on access to finance and engagement in public-private partnerships, provide support to private sector investments through resolving business challenges between the private sector and government institutions, and facilitate fast-tracking access to services for business growth. Other important strategies that MLF will support towards this goal are as follows: 1. Encouraging innovation and integrated technology adoption by private sector actors: Innovation and technology adoption can help to improve the efficiency and competitiveness. MLF and its PSD will work with the private sector to promote the adoption of new technologies, such as improved and integrated herd health, breeding and feeding practices, and to develop innovative business models that support private sector investment targeting improvements in the most sensitive parameters in livestock productivity: reproduction, milk yield, growth rates, morbidity, and morality. For example, MLF-PSD will promote linkages on delivery of livestock vaccines from the private sector (e.g., Hester Biosciences Africa Ltd) to complement vaccines from TVLA and other private service providers. 2. Investing in capacity building: Building the capacity of private sector actors, including livestock keepers, BBT-LIFE participants, traders, is essential to promoting their involvement in the livestock value chain. This includes providing training and technical assistance in areas such as animal health, feed and fodder production, and market access. For example, MLF-PSD will promote engagement by hatcheries such as AKM Glitters and Silverlands, brooders, and vendors to enhance rural commercialization through sale of improved backyard chickens (e.g., Horasi, Kroiler, Sasso) to farmers in remote areas.  3. Facilitating access to finance: Access to finance is a key barrier to private sector investment in the livestock value chain. MLF-PSD will promote partnerships for innovative financing products and mechanisms with micro-finance services involving farmer’s groups, traders, and cooperatives. For example, broker linkages for financing of dairy farmers, producer organizations, traders, and processors by engaging micro-finance institutions in Tanzania such as TADB.  4. Promoting market linkages: Strengthening market linkages between producers and larger buyers, such as processors and slaughterhouses, is essential to promoting private sector involvement in the livestock value chains. MLF-PSD in liaison with LGAs will facilitate market linkages through market information systems, value chain analysis, and setting up linkages among technical service providers, processors and/or cooperatives for service embedding and increasing access to inputs and services. For example, linkages that interlock input and output transactions with milk deliveries as collateral, embedded service delivery for fattening linked to red meat off takers like TanChoice Ltd and Mr Pig Tanzania Ltd.  
Page 12:
  
9  The partnerships with the private sector will not be simply a one-way channel for scaling technologies, but rather pivotal to market assessment, product design, and research implementa-on. MLF understands livestock keepers as private sector cons-tuents, so development support will focus on improving both short-term and long-term prosperity, working directly with farmers’ organiza-ons and linking them to input supply and service delivery. Bringing a business focus to MLF’s work is essen-al to bridge the gap between innova-on and use, and impact at scale. Towards this goal, MLF will revamp its Private Sector Desk (PSD) as a one-stop shop for private sector enterprises, to enable the sharing of solu-ons and address emerging boIlenecks.   Alignment with Building a Be8er Tomorrow (BBT) Youth Ini&a&ve  The proposals herein are chosen to align with the Building a Be+er Tomorrow (BBT) Youth Ini-a-ve for Agribusiness (YIA) championed by the sister Ministry of Agriculture and domes-cated in MLF as BBT Livestock and Fisheries Entrepreneurs (LIFE) or BBT -LIFE6. Both BBT-YIA and BBT-LIFE are more than grand plans to empower millions of young Tanzanians to par-cipate in agri-business; they are tangible, forward-thinking vision for a more prosperous, sustainable, and food-secure future for all. Linking to BBT-YIA and BBT-LIFE will also promote a food systems approach across livestock and crop value chains. The rapidly growing demand for livestock-source foods (LSF) and their higher value can drive related agribusinesses in bundling services that incorporate supply of other nutri-ous foods of lower demand. Innova,ons for development investments across the impact areas The following proven innova-ons are suggested for promo-on by MLF and other development partners as investable solu-ons across the impact areas, with indica-ve costs for implementa-on over 3-5 years in mainland Tanzania7.   1. Scaling of gender-responsive private sector-led women and youth focused chicken-based interven<on to contribute to employment, improved food and nutri<on security and rural incomes.  a) Improve access to and scale-up of improved breeds of dual-purpose backyard village 4-week-old chickens targe-ng 10,000 households per district through private sector agribusinesses providing bundled advisory services and inputs in areas where added advantages for these breeds are iden-ﬁed.  b) Support incuba-on and cost-share of start-ups and scale-ups of 50 small-scale poultry enterprises owned by women, youth and disabled owned per district in produc-on, and marke-ng of locally produced chicken meat and eggs. Poten.al interven.on sites: One district per region (30 districts). A pyramid model with a hatchery ﬁrm at the apex linked to incuba-on clusters comprising brooders act as the nucleus to catalyse uptake by farmers in the regions.  6Building a Better Tomorrow - Youth Initiative for Agribusiness. https://www.kilimo.go.tz/uploads/books/Building_a_Better_Tomorrow_Document_-_BBT-YIA_Booklet_2022.pdf  7 Participation of Zanzibar will be explored after consultations with responsible institutions in the archipelago.

10  Collabora.ng Ins.tu.ons: PPPs involving medium and large-scale hatcheries (e.g., AKM GliIers Ltd, Silverlands), Media communica-on companies (e.g., Shujaaz Inc.), MLF-PSD, SUGECO, TALIRI, ILRI. Es.mated cost: USD 0.5m per district (total = USD 15m). Where piloted: This innova-on was developed by successive pilots in Tanzania, including the ILRI-Led African Chicken Gene-c Gains (ACGG) program, Tropical Poultry Gene-cs Solu-ons (TPGS), and Women in Business (WiB) were implemented in Tanzania in collabora-on with TALIRI and private sector partners. The pilots iden-ﬁed high-performance breeds best suited for the local environment and then nurtured private sector partners to create sustainable businesses linking hatcheries with brooders, vendors, and chicken farmers. These businesses now deliver chicks, and inputs comprising feed, health and vaccines to smallholder farmers producing eggs and broilers. Smallholder farmers now have access to preferred, high producing and well-adapted chicken breeds to low input producing system. These improved breeds enable commercializa-on for more income and improve household nutri-on through household consump-on of more poultry meat and eggs. A lesson learned was the importance of engaging communi-es to empower women and challenge social norms that discourage their involvement in poultry businesses and how community theatre and social and behaviour change campaign can enhance the engagement and improve household nutri-on. The media communica-on campaign targe-ng nega-ve gender norms holding women poultry vendors back from becoming successful businesswomen reached 4.4 million people with 507,000 people ac-vely interac-ng in social digital media.

More recently, there has been an increase in the use of Multistakeholder Platforms (MSP) by several actors within CGIAR and beyond. Multistakeholder dialogues aim to ensure that there is a discussion on challenges facing communities within the different landscapes and how solutions are crafted to address the challenges through practical development interventions. This paper, firstly, engages with literature on MSPs and how gender equality and social inclusion can be made intentional by including women and youths in the processes. Secondly, through the practical implementation of the Aquatic Foods Initiative in Zambia, the actual assessments and practical implementation are being monitored and critiqued through the process documentation of MSP implementation to ensure that women and youths are included. The documentation goes beyond inclusion to document the outcomes of women and youth inclusion. Thirdly, this paper situates MSPs within the CGIAR’s MSPs’ broader community of practice to draw further common threads across different contexts, different resources and across different scales. The early findings demonstrate that it is possible to engage women and youths in the designing, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the MSPs. Such engagement needs to be intentional and must invest time and resources in ensuring that participation goes beyond attendance to informing and influencing the priorities and even going further to ensure those priorities are implemented and reflected upon.

One of these is climate action. In 2021, UNHCR published its Strategic Framework for Climate Action and, in 2022, its Operational Strategy for Climate Resilience and Environmental Sustainability
(2022-2025). This Regional Climate Action Plan for the East and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes (EHAGL)1 outlines a five-year vision and roadmap for the operationalization of these two documents. It highlights how UNHCR aims to accelerate results on climate action in the EHAGL region, in line with the ambition of the UNHCR Strategic Directions 2022-2026 and its Strategic Plan for
Climate Action 2024-2030. The Regional Climate Action Plan also builds upon partnerships and regional climate frameworks, such as the Regional Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (2023-2030) by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). This Strategy highlights the geographical differences and climatic vulnerabilities of the IGAD Member States (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda), and proposes key joint solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation. It also seeks to leverage work being undertaken with IGAD’s Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC)
to develop targeted climate adaptation measures for areas hosting forcibly displaced populations. The present plan was developed following a regional Theory of Change (ToC) workshop on Climate Change held in Nairobi in May 2023, and led by a Multifunctional Climate Team at the EHAGL Regional Bureau. The Plan was validated by technical focal points and sector leads at the Regional Bureau as well as climate focal points in country operations; and was finalized following consultations with key partners across the humanitarian-development-climate-security nexus.

Page 2:
For the 1.5 billion people living in fragile and conflict-affected situations,
livelihood challenges are compounded by climate change, unsustainable
resource consumption, poor governance, and weak social cohesion. Socio-
ecological risks have become increasingly prevalent due to climate change,
environmental degradation, and conflict. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and
preparedness are critical components of a comprehensive approach to
managing and mitigating the impact of disasters. Moreover, given the
disproportionate impact of conflicts and the differential vulnerabilities of
population groups to displacement, it is crucial to gain an in-depth
understanding of the dynamics of socio-ecological risks and implications for
resilience-building. Traditional approaches around socio-ecological risks
have been reactive, however policy makers and humanitarian stakeholders
have recognized the need to shift from a reactive to an anticipatory
approach which entails ex-ante, longer term planning. 
Monitoring these conflict, migration and fragility risks and informing early
action is crucial for preventing severe consequences and strengthening the
resilience of Food, Land and Water systems (FLWs). Indeed, various actors
such as Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and the UN are
implementing and discussing an array of Anticipatory action initiatives. While
early action interventions for monitoring socio-ecological risks are gaining
prominence the approaches and risk indicators differ considerably within
and between climate, development, and humanitarian communities. There is
also a fundamental variance in approaches and risk indicators relating to
triggers and trigger components. This diversity underscores the need for a
cohesive framework which addresses these disparities. This is essential in
devising a comprehensive anticipatory framework that assesses the multi-
dimensional nature of FLWs. 
To allow for precise communication and discourse among experts a
comprehensive understanding of early action initiatives undertaken by
humanitarian, climate, and development organizations is imperative. In this
context, a thorough review of fragility and risk indicators can serve as a
useful framework for understanding current monitoring and early action
practices related to fragility and risk. The review can then be used to identify
limitations and gaps existing in the current approaches which can ultimately
inform the development of a novel risk ‘typology’. Given the absence of
standardized indicators, methods and triggers for monitoring and
addressing socio-ecological risks, the ‘typology’ seeks to establish a new
approach that actors and organizations can employ to inform anticipatory
action. INTRODUCTION 
Improved fragility and risk indicators for Anticipatory Action in food, land and water systems 
Page 3:
Anticipatory action is a proactive approach aimed at reducing the impact of
impending crises by identifying, understanding, and addressing potential
risks before they escalate. This framework draws from insights provided by
the Anticipation Hub, an organization dedicated to advancing the
understanding and implementation of anticipatory action. The framework
not only defines anticipatory action but also outlines key interventions to
address gaps in indicators and trigger components for effective anticipation.
Anticipatory action involves the timely identification and response to
emerging risks or crises based on early warning indicators. It encompasses a
spectrum of activities, from risk analysis and scenario planning to the pre-
positioning of resources and the implementation of targeted interventions.
Anticipatory action seeks to enhance resilience and reduce the impact of
disasters, conflicts, or other crises by acting before the situation reaches a
critical stage. According to a recent report by the Anticipation Hub, there are
70 active anticipatory action frameworks in place in 35 countries and
another 97 frameworks under development in 2022 ( 1). While this is an
impressive number of frameworks, the diversity results in challenges
associated with mainstreaming anticipatory action across all levels of the
humanitarian ecosystem.

STATE OF THE ART
Enhancing the effectiveness of anticipatory action requires a nuanced
understanding of indicators that signal impending crises. With current global
challenges, the convergence of fragility, climate change and socio-ecological
risks pose a threat, particularly to vulnerable populations inhabiting conflict-
affected settings. As the urgency intensifies, international actors have begun
comprehensive assessments and frameworks to frame risk indicators and
triggers. These frameworks, while pivotal in shaping anticipatory action,
require critical evaluation to understand how risk is currently framed, and if
possible, this can be refined or even combined for a more holistic
understanding.
While triggers are recognized as crucial components in specific initiatives
and strategic plans, their widespread inclusion as a fundamental aspect of
global disaster risk reduction frameworks is still an area for further
development. These triggers, often defined as precursory indicators or
parameters signaling an imminent crisis or disaster, hold immense potential
when incorporated systematically into risk assessment and response
strategies. However, the four dimensions in which triggers are currently
framed are often limited to linear, static indicators, that have very little
cross-over to the other dimensions (Fig. 2). For example, hazards are often
individually defined, limiting their representation to singular hazards which
do not co-occur in space or time. Combined with the hazard level, timing is a
critical component which is constrained by forecast skill and lead times and
yet is the backbone of AA. In order to maximize trigger performance and
response, triggers should make use of hybrid components – incorporating
both predictive and observational data. The last two dimensions, the target
and activity, are arguably the most challenging to incorporate, yet
particularly important for effective intervention. Identifying and targeting the
most vulnerable households relies on baseline vulnerability data. However,
this data is rarely incorporated into the trigger, thereby limiting accuracy
and efficacy. Finally, if the previous three dimensions are integrated and
influenced by one-another, AA can identify the most impactful and relevant
activities such as cash, care kits or food, since these would be bound by the
compound hazards, timing, and livelihood focus.
In the pursuit of a more resilient and risk-informed future, the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction emerges as a cornerstone guiding
global efforts. By emphasizing the importance of understanding disaster risk
in all its dimensions, the framework advocates for an approach that
addresses the underlying connectedness and drivers of risk, including but
not limited to climate change, economic loss, and social vulnerabilities.
Improved fragility and risk indicators for Anticipatory Action in food, land and water systems 
Page 5:
The framework focuses on the adoption of measures which address
dimensions of disaster risk. Additionally, it prioritizes the enhancement of
access to and availability of multi-hazard early warning systems. The
framework outlines four primary priorities which include 1) Understanding
disaster risk 2) Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster
risk 3) Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience and 4) Enhancing
disaster preparedness for effective response and to “Build Back Better” in
recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.
Within the landscape of disaster risk reduction, the United Nations Office for
Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has also provided a Global Risk Assessment
Framework (GRAF). The GRAF provides invaluable insights into the complex
landscapes of hazards and vulnerabilities worldwide. Here they endeavor to
surpass conventional linear risk assessments, recognized as insufficient in
comprehending modern-day risks. Strengthening resilience necessitates a
shift from assessing and addressing hazards independently towards
acknowledging the systemic nature of risk where shocks frequently cascade
and compound in complex ways. The GRAF therefore aims to promote use of
scalable, systemic risk information to support planning. However, these
frameworks and data standards lack emphasis on triggers.
Triggers and trigger components serve as critical elements in the landscape
of anticipatory action, contributing significantly to the efficacy of early
warning systems and prompt response mechanisms. While comprehensive
assessments and frameworks are vital, the identification and utilization of
triggers play a pivotal role in initiating timely actions. Some existing
mechanisms prioritize trigger components, aligning with the core principles
of anticipatory action. For instance, initiatives like the Forecast-based
Financing (FbF) mechanism pioneered by the Red Cross Red Crescent
Movement emphasize trigger components derived from meteorological
forecasts and predictive models often from both local and global
meteorological institutes. FbF strategically links triggers to predetermined
actions, ensuring anticipatory measures are activated before disasters
escalate, thereby minimizing impacts on vulnerable communities.
In its 2023-2026 Strategic Plan, OCHA is also amplifying its commitment to
mainstream and expand anticipatory action following successful piloting
efforts. OCHA's implementation strategy involves the facilitation of
coordinated and collective anticipatory action approaches. This approach is
structured around three pivotal elements: first, a forecast-based trigger
integrated into a transparent decision-making process; second, pre-
established action plans designed to mitigate emergency impacts and
reduce the reliance on humanitarian relief efforts; and third, pre-arranged
financial mechanisms.

While not yet released, INFORM Warning aims to provide a comprehensive,
quantified, and accessible repository of multi-hazard early warning
information. The types of information that will be included are trends in risk
drivers and crisis severity, seasonal and cyclical risks and forecasts and
predictions. The platform aims to collate and synthesize this information to
show the changes of risk at country level over time, including aspects of
specific scenarios that could result in a crisis as well as basic information
about them- such as the primary drivers of risk as well as the timing, type,
and level of impacts. Users can then take the results and combine it with
other information to build complete early warning scenarios of impact
analysis. 
Addressing the multifaceted nature of triggers involves navigating various
challenges. One significant hurdle is the contextual relevance of triggers
across different regions and hazard profiles. What might serve as a reliable
trigger in one geographical location or for a specific type of disaster may not
hold the same predictive value elsewhere. This necessitates a dynamic
approach, accommodating local knowledge, socio-cultural nuances, and
specific vulnerabilities to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of trigger-
based systems. Collaborative efforts between local communities, national
agencies, and international organizations are instrumental in tailoring
trigger frameworks to diverse contexts, promoting inclusivity and accuracy in
anticipatory actions. 
The evolution of anticipatory action towards a more dynamic,
multidimensional indicator holds promise for revolutionizing disaster risk
reduction strategies worldwide. However, to realize its full potential,
concerted efforts are needed to embed triggers within the foundation of
global frameworks, ensuring adaptability and contextual relevance. In the
following sections we propose the framing of a novel risk ‘typology’, with a
focus on compound triggers. The evolving typology seeks to develop a
standardized yet flexible approach that empowers communities and
institutions to anticipate, response and mitigate risks effectively.

In order to improve the efficacy of AA, advances should focus on 1)
developing integrated social and environmental indicators or triggers that
are location specific, 2) implement continuous monitoring and evaluation
and 3) cross-sectoral collaboration (Fig. 3.).  
Contextual relevance of social and environmental indicators: 1.
Critical to the improvement of AA is the development of novel risks and
triggers that are context-specific, incorporating social and environmental
components that are relevant to the local population. AA needs to be multi-
indicator and regionally appropriate, this ensures that anticipatory action is
tailored to the unique vulnerabilities of each community. The indicators
should also be co-developed with communities to establish mechanisms for
ongoing community feedback to validate and adjust indicators. Cultural
practices, community behaviors and local knowledge play crucial roles in
identifying triggers. Incorporating traditional knowledge and community
perceptions into the indicator framework recognizes the importance of local
insights in anticipating crises. The indicator framework should also offer
flexibility to incorporate new triggers or adapt existing ones based on
changing environment, social or economic conditions. Figure 2: Dimensions of trigger development

     2. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:
Implement advanced data collection technologies, such as satellite imagery,
IoT devices, and social media analytics, to enable real-time monitoring of
indicators and disasters. This facilitates a more dynamic and responsive
anticipatory approach. Develop an iterative process for continuous
monitoring and evaluation, allowing anticipatory strategies to evolve based
on the changing nature of indicators. This adaptive approach ensures that
interventions remain effective in dynamic environments. The mechanism
would need to establish a feedback loop that captures lessons learned from
previous anticipatory actions. Analyze the outcomes of interventions to
refine indicator frameworks, promoting a culture of continuous improvement
in anticipatory strategies. Building upon hybrid triggers, sophisticated
predictive models and early warning systems should leverage continuous
monitoring and predictive analytics to anticipate potential crises. 
      3. Cross-Sectoral Collaboration:
Interdisciplinary research teams comprising experts from diverse fields
foster a holistic approach to indicator development. These teams can
collaboratively identify and refine indicators that capture the complexity of
emerging crises. Platforms such as the Anticipation Hub are well positioned
to facilitation knowledge exchange, dialogue, guidance and joint training
programs for professionals across sectors to enhance their understanding
of different indicators. Platforms such as this foster partnerships and
collaborative networks across borders, regions and subregions to share best
practices, data and expertise. A global collaboration amplifies the
effectiveness of anticipatory action, ensuring more coordinated and
impactful responses to multifaced crises that transcend individual
jurisdictions.
Merging hybrid trigger mechanisms ( 2), we propose a new risk and trigger
typology which is able to capture and represent multiple location-specific
indicators over a continuum of time (Fig. 3).

The occurrence of extreme weather hazards is increasing, with intensified
frequency and intensity, leading to significant impact on ecosystems and
human well-being ( 2 – 5). Beyond isolated hazards, the growing emergence of
high impact compound events requires immediate attention to minimize
further loss and damage ( 4 , 6 , 7). Here we propose a multi-dimensional
trigger which incorporates interconnected environmental and socioeconomic
crises, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable groups, including,
refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum seekers and stateless people.
In order to ensure contextual relevance and maximize application, this
framework was co-developed with UNHCR.
Compound events manifest through the interaction of hazards or drivers,
such as extreme heat and drought or strong winds and heavy precipitation.
The selection of climate triggers underwent a rigorous methodological
process aimed at identifying hazards significantly impacting the world most
vulnerable groups. This involved the co-development of climate impacts to
regions hosting vulnerable communities. The final selection of climate
triggers was three primary climatic threats—extreme heat, drought, and
flood—owing to their frequent occurrence and profound implications for
displaced individuals.

VULNERABLE

To synthesize these climate triggers into a unified composite index for each
location, we utilized a mathematical technique known as the Euclidean norm.
This methodology facilitates the integration of various triggers into a
cohesive metric, prioritizing the severity and co-occurrence of these
hazards. Unlike conventional averaging methods, the Euclidean norm
pinpoints the most substantial values across the different hazards. As a
result, it accentuates scenarios where a particular hazard holds notably
greater weight or where multiple hazards converge, ensuring the composite
index emphasizes the most intense or compound risks faced by displaced
populations. The Euclidean norm plays a pivotal role in crafting a composite
index devoid of biases towards any singular dominant trigger. Instead, it
highlights instances where multiple hazards intersect or where one hazard
significantly outweighs others. Furthermore, the approach was therefore
able to capture all relevant climate information along a time continuum for a
specific location.
Following the selection and synthesis of climate triggers, the analysis
incorporated critical livelihood indicators tailored to each location hosting
forcibly displaced populations. These livelihood indicators include aspects
such as crop health and community health status, over time. This
multifaceted approach therefore incorporates the intersecting
vulnerabilities of the target population linked to livelihood sustainability and
community well-being, beyond just hazards.
For each location, the composite index not only considers the intensity and
co-occurrence of climate-related hazards, but also cross-references these
with the impacts on local crops and health conditions. This approach allows
for a nuanced understanding of the compound risks faced by forcibly
displaced populations, acknowledging that a complete trigger event should
encompass both climatic threats and socio-economic vulnerabilities
associated with focus regions.
While this approach does enable a more comprehensive development of
triggers for AA, there are still numerous components which can be
improved. Firstly, the compound risks only incorporate a longer-term
horizon forecast, yet lack any observational component. Secondly, there are
multiple other hazards which could be included. Likewise, there are also
multiple socio-economic indicators which should be included to capture the
vulnerability component more accurately. Importantly, each of the socio-
economic indicators should also be localized with ground-based knowledge
in order for them to be effective. Consequently, this framework offers some
progressive steps and insights to improve proactive interventions in
anticipatory action.

CONCLUSION
Improving indicators in anticipatory action is a multifaceted challenge that
requires a combination of technological advancements, community
engagement, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By focusing on the
integration of social and environmental indicators, continuous monitoring
and evaluation, and cross-sectoral collaboration, the anticipatory action
framework can become more robust and responsive. This approach ensures
that indicators evolve with the changing nature of crises, leading to more
effective and timely anticipatory interventions.

EAST  AND  HORN OF AFRICA AND GREAT LAKES REGION |  CLIMATE ACTION PLAN | 2023 - 2028  
OVERVIEW  
The climate crisis is driving displacement and making life harder for those already forced to flee.  Protection 
and solutions  for displaced people are becoming more difficult  to achieve as climate change adds to degraded 
and dangerous conditions in areas of origin and refuge. Millions of refugees , internally  displaced and stateless 
people are living in climate “hotspots” , where they typically lack the resources to adapt to an increasingly 
inhospitable environment.  The East  and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes (EHAGL) Region is one of the most 
climate -vulnerable regions globally  and has seen t he number of forcibly displaced people in the  region  almost  
triple over the past decade . 
Forcibly displaced populations often live in areas that are expected to see the most drastic increases in climate 
hazards by 2030. To address the challenges  they face , UNHCR seeks  to form a coalition of partners across 
the hum anitarian -development -climate -security nexus , and leverage climate adaptation and resilience 
investments in support of areas host ing forcibly displaced populations. UNHCR will also strengthen its 
operations to meet the protection and assistance needs exacerbated by climate emergencies . Much of the 
work we do  in vulnerable humanitarian contexts , ranging from preparedness and response, cash -based 
assistance , durable shelter, and others,  contributes to the climate  resilience and adaptive capacities of 
displaced and host communities , but we need to do more . 
The key objectives of the 2023 -2028 UNHCR  EHAGL  Region  Climate Action Plan , which lists priority action 
points to better implement existing UNHCR  global climate  commitments , are the following:  
• Through increased legal, policy and normative engagement, states will improve their capacity to 
consistently provide protection to people fleeing from and living in climate  crises.  UNHCR will provide 
legal and policy advice, guidance, and support to national governments, regional economic  communities, 
and other relevant stakeholders, to develop enhanced protection for refugees and other people displaced 
in the context  of disasters and climate change.  
• Through expanded partnerships and scaled up financing,  displaced populations and their hosts will have  
increased access to environmentally sustainable resources and services.  We are committed to reducing 
environmental degr adation in displacement settings and enhancing the preparedness and resilience of 
displaced people and host communities.  We will continue to advocate for a scale up on adaptation 
financing and support to climate action in countries and host community areas  where displaced people 
take refuge or hope to safely return to.  
• Through inclusion into national plans and systems, forcibly displaced, stateless people and their hosts 
will have the economic and physical means to prepare for, survive and recover from climate shocks and 
stresses. UNHCR will advocate for the inclusion of refugees into regional and national climate change 
related policies and plans and striv e to improve the ir anticipatory and early warning capacit ies to better 
prepare for emergencies brought on by climate -related and other natural hazards.  
UNHCR will also continue its efforts to function with a significantly reduced carbon footprint and to ha ve the 
means and systems in place to minimize negative impacts on the environment . We seek  to reduce the carbon 
footprint of our own operations by implementing green solutions  to reduc e greenhouse gas emissions .

Introduction  
 
“Right now, i n our region, climate change  is amplifying  the risk of 
conflict and ultimately forcing already vulnerable  people to flee 
their homes . We need proactive and bold action , commitment,  
and dedication  from all actors  to protect communities , and to  find 
solutions  with and for those on the frontlines of the climate 
emergency. ” 
Mamadou Dian Balde  
Director , Regional Bureau for the East  and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes  
 
As a central component of the 2022 -2026 UNHCR Strategic Directions , UNHCR has globally identified eight focus areas that 
require renewed attention and accelerated effort . One of  these is climate action. In 202 1, UNHCR published its Strategic 
Framework for Climate Action  and, in 2022 , its Operational Strategy for Climate Resilience and Environmental Sustainability 
(2022 -2025 ).  
This Regional  Climate Action  Plan for the East and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes (EHAGL)1 outlines  a five-year vision and 
roadmap for the operationalization of the se two documents. It highlight s how UNHCR aims to accelerate results on climate 
action in  the EHAGL region , in line with the ambition of the  UNHCR Strategic Directions 2022 -2026  and its  Strategic Plan for 
Climate Action  2024 -2030 . 
The Regional Climate Action Plan also builds  upon partnerships and regional climate frameworks , such as the Regional 
Climate Change Strategy an d Action Plan (2023 -2030)  by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) . This  
Strategy highlights the  geographical differences and  climatic  vulnerabilit ies of the IGAD Member States ( Djibouti, Eritrea, 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan,  and Uganda) , and propos es key joint solutions for climate mitigation and 
adaptation. It also seeks to leverage  work being undertaken with  IGAD’s Climate Prediction and Applications Cent re (ICPAC) 
to develop targeted climate adaptation measures for areas hosting forcibly displaced populations.  
The present  plan was developed following a regional Theory of Change  (ToC)  workshop on Climate Change held in Nairobi 
in May 2023, and led by a Multifunctional Climate Team at the EHAGL Regional Bureau. The Plan was validated by technical 
focal points and sector leads at the Regional Bureau as well as climate focal points in country operations ; and was finalized 
following consultations with key partners  across the humanitarian -development -climate -security nexus.

Situation analysis  
 
Refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and stateless people are on the frontlines of the  climate  emergency. Many are 
living in climate “hotspots”, where they typically lack the resources to adapt to an increasingly hostile environment  and are 
therefore unable to live self -sufficient  and dignified lives . UNHCR is providing protection and assistance to many refugees and 
other people displaced by the effects of climate change, as well as helping them increase their resilience to future disaster s. 
By October 2023, the EHAGL  region hosted  a total of 1 9 million forcibly displaced individuals. Of these, more than  5.4 million 
were  refugees and asylum -seekers, meaning the region host ed one out of every six refugees globally. Over 1 3.6 million 
persons were  internally displaced.2 Of the latter, at least 2.1 million people were living in internal displacement by the end of 
2022 following the impacts of hazardous climate -related events or “disasters”, primarily floods and droughts .3 
A joint UNHCR -IGAD study, funded by the Migration  Multi -Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) on Human Mobility and Climate Change 
in the IGAD region4, show s that in the EHAGL region , climate change is a “risk multiplier” that is driving both displacement 
and deepening protection needs. It underscores that resilience to environmental degradation and climate -related disasters 
and displacement is often lowest in frag ile and conflict -affected contexts.  
A recent IMF paper on Climate Challenges in Fragile and Conflict -Affected States5 finds that climate vulnerability and 
underlying fragilities , namely conflict, heavy dependence on rainfed agriculture, and weak capacity and policy buffers , 
exacerbate each other, amplifying the negative impact on people and economies. Of the eleven countries covered by 
UNHCR’s EHAGL Regional  Bureau, six (Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan)  appear on the 2024 
list of fragile and conflict -affected situa tions (FY 24 FCS list) , released annually by the World Bank Group (WBG).  These  six 
countries host 47 per cent of all  refugees and asylum -seekers  in the region as well as  100 per cent of all IDPs . Meanwhile, as 
of 2022, approximately 4.8 millio n refugees and asylum -seekers, constituting 97 per  cent of the total population hosted in the 
region of  around  4.9 million, originate from fragile and conflict -affected states .6 
Many displaced populations  are frequently located in peripheral , rural,  or peri -urban locations  and rely on agropastoralism as 
their primary source of income . They  lack social safety nets that can assist with loans and support to diversify income sources. 
In addition , access to sufficient, good quality land for agriculture -based livelihoods remains challenging, despite farming being 
one of the key sectors of employment. A similar situation applies to grazing land  which  is frequently","10013"

Climate change impacts on temperatures, rainfall patterns and extreme weather events are deepening the challenges of marginalized populations regarding food security, livelihood options, housing needs and access/availability of natural resources. Domestic and international migration constitutes a common adaptative strategy for individuals, households and communities experiencing these hardships, while also posing a challenge to populations suffering from involuntary immobility. However, human mobility can also trigger conflicts, social tensions and human security risks. Simultaneously, violence, socioenvironmental conflicts, and extreme weather and geophysical events are common drivers of displacement. In turn, displacement is also frequently linked to socioeconomic and climate vulnerabilities, as well as social tensions and human security risks. However, human mobility does not necessarily always lead to conflict or insecurity, as there are also cooperative opportunities in addressing climate change to foster resilience and peace. Consequently, it is important to understand how these interconnections and compounding risks interplay across Guatemala and how it operates differently across geographic, economic, gender and social dimensions. The purpose of this factsheet is therefore to explore these complex interactions between climate, security and human mobility in Guatemala. To acknowledge and conceptualize these interactions four main pathways were identified: Pathway 1: Conflict and human security risks as a result of climate-related migration. Pathway 2: Conflict and human security risks as a result of displacement produced by climate-related and geophysical disasters. Pathway 3: Compounding risks and vulnerabilities as a result of displacement produced by violence.

Climate change, commonly referred to as a “threat multiplier” of pre-existing socioeconomic issues, already undermines rural livelihoods by reducing agricultural yields and income opportunities. This paper provides a review of climate-related migration in the CADC region while identifying the specific pathways by which climate change manifests itself as a threat multiplier to migration. Different forms of human mobility (seasonal/temporal/permanent and internal/international migration) are increasingly attempted as adaptation strategies by affected households to diversify incomes and offset climate impacts. Preferred intra-regional migrant destinations tend to be less climate-vulnerable and also less violent. Notably, climate change is not isolated from socioeconomic and political migration drivers. Erosion of rural livelihoods reduces the costs of engaging in illicit coping strategies (e.g., illegal crop production) and simultaneously favours rapid urbanisation, which is linked to (forced) gang recruitment, primarily affecting the youth. These processes contribute to extraordinarily high violence levels, which are a major push factor for migration on their own, ultimately challenging state authority. Moreover, as outmigration from the region is projected to increase, the observed securitisation of borders, particularly along the USA-Mexico border and the Mexico-Guatemala border, while unfit to limit migration attempts, make migration more desperate and dangerous, allowing organised crime to step in and exploit migration as an economic undertaking. Thus, for the CADC, the depoliticised and simplistic narrative of migration serving as adaptation must be questioned. Policy coherence and state capacity for addressing climate-security-migration nexus challenges are critical needs.

Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        1
Page 3:
Guatemala is characterized by high rates of poverty and inequality, as well as a
significant incidence of violent acts and generalized social tension. Climate change
impacts on temperatures, rainfall patterns and extreme weather events are
deepening the challenges of marginalized populations regarding food security,
livelihood options, housing needs and access/availability of natural resources.
Domestic and international migration constitutes a common adaptative strategy for
individuals, households and communities experiencing these hardships, while also
posing a challenge to populations suffering from involuntary immobility. However,
human mobility can also trigger conflicts, social tensions and human security risks.
Simultaneously, violence, socioenvironmental conflicts, and extreme weather and
geophysical events are common drivers of displacement. In turn, displacement is
also frequently linked to socioeconomic and climate vulnerabilities, as well as social
tensions and human security risks. However, human mobility does not necessarily
always lead to conflict or insecurity, as there are also cooperative opportunities in
addressing climate change to foster resilience and peace. Consequently, it is
important to understand how these interconnections and compounding risks
interplay across Guatemala and how it operates differently across geographic,
economic, gender and social dimensions. The purpose of this factsheet is therefore
to explore these complex interactions between climate, security and human
mobility in Guatemala. To acknowledge and conceptualize these interactions four
main pathways were identified: 
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        2
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Page 4:
Pathway 1: 
Conflict and human security risks as a result of climate-related migration. 
The impacts of climate change in Guatemala, mediated by socioeconomic
inequalities and institutional fragilities, affect negatively the availability and access
to natural resources, as well as food and livelihood insecurities. Migration is used
as a coping mechanism for individuals, households and communities seeking to flee
from these vulnerable contexts and find alternative livelihood opportunities.
Nevertheless, migrants are often exposed to human security risk during transit and
in destination areas. Similarly, human mobility patterns may produce conflict
escalation in origin and receiving areas. 
Pathway 2: 
Conflict and human security risks as a result of displacement produced by climate-
related and geophysical disasters. 
Guatemala is highly vulnerable to natural disasters such as tropical storms, floods,
mass movements and volcanic/seismic activity. Displacement produced by climate-
related and geophysical disasters can exacerbate human security risks and conflicts
in origin and receiving areas, as well as in IDPs transit routes. Shelters and urban
areas receiving displacement often suffer from poor infrastructure, lack of social
services and weak state presence, leading to socioeconomic vulnerabilities,
dynamics of violence and limited response strategies to natural hazards.  
 
Pathway 3: 
Compounding risks and vulnerabilities as a result of displacement produced by violence.
 
Violent displacement in Guatemala is the result of multiple factors including drug
trafficking activities, gangs' territorial expansion, weak state presence and land
grabbing dynamics produced by extractive economies. Domestic and gender-based
violence are also main drivers of displacement in the country. Displacement
produced by violence has strong negative consequences on climate adaptation and
resilience capacities, places of origin, transit and destination. IPDs are particularly
vulnerable to climate hazards in transit routes, temporary shelters, as well as rural
or urban destinations.   
 
Pathway 4: 
Immobility and trapped populations 
Human mobility, as a coping mechanism to endure climate vulnerabilities and
socioeconomic hardship, is not a feasible option for all individuals and households
in Guatemala. Victims of involuntary immobility, also known as trapped populations,
can be restricted by economic challenges, extreme climatic conditions and social
limitations, such as gendered duties and social norms. Trapped populations are
highly vulnerable to worse climatic and socioeconomic conditions, often leading to
compounding vulnerabilities, maladaptive initiatives, human security risks and
conflicts escalation.

Climate Exposure and Vulnerability  
 
Located within the tropics and with a mountainous relief, Guatemala experiences a
diverse climate. The western highlands of the country experiences colder
temperatures, whereas the northern region of Petén has tropical forests.
Additionally, Guatemala features humid coastal regions that contrast with the drier
weather experienced in the western region, along the Central American Dry
Corridor (MARN et al., 2021). Seasonal precipitation occurs from May to October
and is primarily characterized by a brief dry spell, known as the mid-summer
drought, where a reduction of about 40% in rainfall is experienced for a period
ranging from a few weeks to a month in July or August (Bardales et al., 2021; MARN
et al., 2021). 
 
Due to its high vulnerability and poor adaptative capacities to the effects of climate
change, Guatemala is regarded as a main hotspot for climate change (Notre Dame
University, 2022). Similarly, because of extreme weather and non-climate-related
natural hazards like earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcano eruptions, Guatemala is
considered one of the nations that is most susceptible in terms of climate
variability (IEP, 2021; MARN et al., 2021). The maximum and lowest daily
temperatures have increased by 0.8ºC and 0.6ºC, respectively, over the previous
twenty years, with increases most pronounced in February, July, August, and
September (MARN et al., 2021). The Pacific coast, Bocacosta, Valles de Oriente and
the Caribbean are the regions which have experienced the most temperature rises
(MARN et al., 2021). Rainfall patterns have changed dramatically over the past 20
years, with an increase of 122mm in the average annual rainfall and more intense
and sparsely spaced rainy days (MARN et al., 2021).

CONTEXT
Page 6:
Temperatures are expected to rise between 2°C and 4°C by 2050, with the Pacific
coasts and semi-arid valleys experiencing the largest rises (García Morales, 2019;
MARN et al., 2021). In the semi-arid area of the country, located in the Dry Corridor,
climate projections expect a reduction in precipitation of up to 50% (Bardales et al.,
2021). Although fewer rainy days are predicted, major events like tropical cyclones
are anticipated to occur more frequently nationwide (Bardales et al., 2021).
According to climate projections, the mid-summer drought will start earlier and last
longer (+18 days), which will expand the semi-arid environment across more
regions (Maurer et al., 2017). It is anticipated that the departments of Baja Verapaz,
Sacatepéquez, Totonicapán, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, El Progreso, Zacapa,
Jutiapa, Chiquimula, as well as the north-western regions of Quiche and
Huehuetenango, will experience significant impacts on water availability (Bardales
et al., 2021). Municipalities situated in coastal-marine regions are expected to
exhibit a significant degree of vulnerability to climate change, ranging from “high” to
“very high” (NUSAID, 2017). This vulnerability stems mostly from the projected
increase in sea levels, estimated to elevate by approximately 9 to 13 cm by the year
2050, and inducing adverse consequences such as flooding and erosion (MARN et
al., 2021; USAID, 2017). 
Conflict and Fragility   
 
Guatemala has seen a recent history marked by instances of military coups, a
protracted civil war, the imposition of authoritarian rule, and a prevailing
atmosphere of instability and insecurity. The country exhibits a significant incidence
of homicides and violent crimes associated with gang activities and organized
crime, in which drug trafficking activities significantly contribute to the overall state
of insecurity (IEP, 2021; Nett & Rüttinger, 2016).   
 
Within the context of the Cold War era, Guatemala experienced a 36-years long civil
war (1960-1996). After the overthrow of the democratically elected president
Jacobo Arbenz in 1954, Guatemala witnessed a confrontation between conservative
and leftist factions, leading to revolutionary conflicts and subsequent government
repression (Álvarez Aragón et al., 2013; Molden, 2015). Between 1965 through to
the mid-1990s, Guatemala experienced an internal armed conflict characterized by
hostilities between the government forces and various insurgent factions, including
the FAR (Rebel Armed Forces), the EGP (Guerilla Army of the Poor), and the PGT
(Guatemalan Worker's Party) (UCDP, 2023). This period was marked by asymmetrical
acts of aggression, leading to the death and disappearance of an estimated 200,000
individuals, with about 83 percent belonging to indigenous Mayan tribes. It is for
this reason that the Commission for Historical Clarification has determined that
these communities endured a genocide (UCDP, 2023; ODHAG, 1998). 
In spite of the peace agreement, Guatemala is still struggling with persistent
violence in the aftermath of the civil war. This violence emanates from several
sources, including both state and non-state actors, including organized crime and
gang violence (Godoy, 2006; Knowlton, 2017; Rodgers & Muggah, 2009). Guatemala
is positioned along  the  drug  smuggling  route  between  South and North America  
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        5

and has experienced an escalation in violence associated with drug trafficking,
micro-trafficking, extortion, and money laundering activities (Del Mercado et al.,
2021; ICG, 2017; Nett & Rüttinger, 2016). Guatemala has some of the highest rates
of homicide within both Latin America and the global context, alongside a notable
prevalence of femicide rates (UNICEF, 2014; World Bank, 2021a). These elements
have played a significant role in the classification of Guatemala as the second most
perilous nation for individuals under the age of nineteen, (UNICEF, 2014). 
Socio-environmental conflicts have also been fueled by the emergence of new
economic activities, primarily extractive in nature (INTRAPAZ, 2009). Conflict
between local communities and transnational corporation-affiliated extractive
industries has been linked to large-scale investments, such as the development of
hydroelectric plants on the Northern Transversal Strip highway, the reactivation of
nickel mining in Izabal, and the cultivation of sugar cane in Polochic (INTRAPAZ,
2009; López et al., 2021). In addition, there are frequent disputes over access to
natural resources between social groups and communities. There is evidence of
both intra- and intercommunity conflict in Sololá, between Santa Catarina
Ixtahuacán and Nahualá municipalities, and in San Marcos, between Tajumulco and
Ixchiguán municipalities (ACLED, 2022; Garcia, 2022; Tejiendo Paz, 2020). Most of
areas with ongoing social conflicts are characterized by a historically high inequality
and insecure land tenure, reason why these tensions are viewed as continuations of
socioecomic conditions that fueled the civil war, even though they are not directly
related (López et al., 2021).   
Socio-economic Context  
Guatemala is classified as an upper middle-income country, with some of the
highest rates of poverty and inequality found in Latin America (World Bank, 2021b).
Agriculture continues to be one of the most significant economic sectors, with up to
31% of all employment (World Bank, 2021b). Up to 1.8 million jobs are produced by
the coffee industry alone (Canet Brenes et al., 2016). The agricultural sector is
particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, given that most agricultural
production is rainfed and that over 80% of agricultural-based GDP is generated in
regions at risk of disaster (Hernández, 2012; World Bank, 2011).   
 
The nation's rates of poverty and inequality are still alarmingly high. In the
departments located in the Dry Corridor, unemployment rates might reach 54%
(WFP et al., 2017). Guatemala has one of the highest 20 Gini values in the world and
is considered to be one of the most unequal nations in Latin America (World Bank,
2014). While 1% of Guatemalans own 40% of the nation's wealth (Oficina Económica
y Comercial de España en Guatemala, 2022), 49% of the country's population live
below the upper-middle income poverty line (World Bank, 2020), and 10% of its
people subsist on less than $2 USD per day (World Bank, 2014). Indigenous Peoples
experience a disproportionately high rate of poverty, with 79% of them living in
poverty (WFP, 2022). Since high levels of gender inequality restrict women's access
to land, resources, financial services, and employment prospects, women are
disproportionately affected by these vulnerabilities (Howland et al., 2021).   
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        6 
Page 8:
Guatemala experiences the triple burden of obesity, micronutrient deficiencies, and
malnutrition, in line with the Latin American trend (IICA, 2018). In terms of chronic
malnutrition, Guatemala is ranked seventh in the world (Romero, 2022). There is a
high percentage of food insecurity as well: 46.5% of children under five suffer from
chronic malnutrition (WFP, 2022). The highest rates of food insecurity are found in
the departments of Quiché, Baja Verapaz, and Huehuetenango (Läderach et al.,
2021). Guatemala's agriculture industry accounts for 9.4% of GDP (World Bank,
2021b), making it the second largest market in Central America for US exports of
processed food items. As such, Guatemala is extremely susceptible to shocks to the
global food supply.   
 
The government is heavily dependent on the international community for
emergency financing as a result of not having enough money to address problems
with food security and to provide basic healthcare (Müller et al., 2020). Additionally,
poor governance and corruption have hampered the state's capacity to respond to
the population needs during times of crisis and has undermined efforts of
adaptation and mitigation of climate change (Nett & Rüttinger, 2016; Notre Dame
University, 2022). 
Human Mobility 
 
Poverty, unemployment, and violence have been the historic drivers of human
mobility in Guatemala. The Civil War produced an unprecedent outbreak of rural-
urban migration and, since the 1970s, there has been a large-scale transnational
flow of exiled populations moving towards Mexico and the United States (Jonas,
2013). Since then, indigenous populations have been especially prone to migrate
due to structural inequalities and marginalization that they have historically
suffered (Taylor et al., 2006; Jonas, 2013). Human mobility in the country is
influenced by various factors, such as violence, gender-based violence (GBV),
extortion, corruption, geophysical natural disasters and rising climate variability
and the higher intensity and frequency of extreme weather events (Milan & Ruano,
2014; Pons, 2021).   
 
According to an IDMC report (2023), by the end of 2022 there was a total of
316,000 internally displaced people (IDP). Conflicts and human insecurities, largely
influenced by climate variability on rain-fed agriculture, were the main push factors,
motivating 242,000 of those IDPs to migrate, while extreme weather events were
the second reason for internal displacement, accounting for 74,000 IDPs (IMDC,
2023). Rural-urban mobility, towards main cities such as Guatemala City, is a
growing trend characterized by insecure and vulnerable urban contexts, without
the necessary urban planning and social services to absorb the demands of a
growing population (Nett and Rüttinger, 2016; IOM, 2021). On the other hand, rural-
rural movements are mainly linked to seasonal work, involving internal migration or
towards bordering regions, as it constitutes an alternative livelihood strategy for
farmers and indigenous communities that work on cash crop plantations, such as
coffee, sugar cane and plantain that is produced (Ruiz de Oña et al., 2019).   
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        7
Page 9:
In the case of transnational mobility, its estimated that 12 to 14% of Guatemalan
citizens are currently living abroad, primarily in the United States, where more than
1.8 million Guatemalans are believed to be residing (JICA, 2022; Moslimani et al.,
n.d.). According to UNHCR (2022), the United States has received 157,113 asylum-
Seekers and 25,552 refugees from Guatemala, while in Mexico there are 4,125
Asylum-Seekers and 8,184 refugees. Additionally, 50 per cent of migrants deported
from the United States, including non-accompanied minors, are estimated to come
from Guatemala (Tejiendo Paz, 2020). The lack of support for returned migrants
makes Guatemalan returnees particularly vulnerable to socioeconomic
marginalization (Worby, 2013). 
 
Guatemala has become a host and transit country, as it is part of the Central
American route for people migrating to the United States (IOM, 2022). According to
UNHCR (2022), Guatemala hosts 701 refugees and up to 1,519 asylum-seekers. The
absence of official channels to facilitate migration procedures and ensure the
protection of migrants from Latin America to the United States has pushed the use
of irregular channels through smugglers and has exposed migrants to human
trafficking and life-threatening risks (Delavelle, 2015; UN, 2013). Issues like border
enforcement, separation of families, deportations and human rights violations
against migrants are currently part of the political debate responding to the
concerns of an international community trying to deal with the increasing number
of people attempting to migrate to the United States (Frelick et al., 2016; Sørensen,
2016).

In Guatemala, changes in rainfall patterns, rising temperatures and extreme
weather events, mediated by socioeconomic inequalities and institutional
vulnerabilities, have negatively affected the availability and access to natural
resources, including arable land, water sources, forests and fish populations (Ferré
García et al., 2023). Similarly, there is extensive evidence on how climate variability
and extreme weather events negatively affect livelihood and food security of local
communities in Guatemala (Ferré García et al., 2023; Medina et al., 2023; Howland
et al., 2021; Britos et al., 2023). Individuals and households experiencing livelihood
and food insecurity rely on diverse coping strategies, including migrating towards
more prosperous areas, less impacted by climate change and with other income-
generating opportunities (Christian Aid, 2019; Britos et al., 2023). However, despite
the relevance of migration as an adaptation strategy, migration is also often linked
with different human security risks during transit and in receiving areas (Penel et
al., 2023). Likewise, communities experiencing scarcity or limited access to natural
resources are compelled to migrate to areas with greater availability of resources,
sometimes leading to competition and conflict escalation with other groups seeking
the same natural resources (Ferré García et al., 2023; Long & Hatting, 2018). 
Climate impacts on livelihood insecurity and the availability and access to
natural resources  
 
The effects of climate change such as rising temperatures, changes in rainfall
patterns and coastal degradation are already affecting important sectors of the
economy that are crucial for food production and employment provision in
Guatemala, including agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries (FAO, 2018;
Harvey et al., 2018). These consequences are especially negative on vulnerable
populations dependent on small-scale subsistence agriculture and/or informal
employment as well as marginalized populations such as women and indigenous
people (Alpízar et al., 2020; IPC, 2022; WFP, 2022). 
 
Small-scale agriculture constitutes the main source of food for households in rural
Guatemala, and is one of the main economic sectors, representing up to 30.4% per
cent of the total employment in the country (ILO, 2021). However, most small-scale
farmers are highly dependent on precipitation patterns, as rain-fed agriculture is
widely practiced throughout the country and accounts for 71 per cent of the total
agricultural output (WFP et al., 2017; USAID, 2017; Deza et al., 2022). Climate
variability, such as irregular rainfall and prolonged dry spells have increased water
evaporation and soil erosion, lowering crop productivity (Vargas et al., 2017;
Beveridge et al., 2019). Suboptimal agricultural conditions are already affecting
crop yields, especially for smallholder rain-fed farmers, increasing crop losses for
staple foods like corn, beans and rice in the region (Harvey et al., 2018; Pons,
2021). It is projected that agricultural productivity will experience a decline by
2050,  as  evidenced by potential yield reductions of  35  percent for sugarcane and 1. CONFLICT AND HUMAN SECURITY RISKS AS A
RESULT OF CLIMATE-RELATED MIGRATION

Page 12:
14 percent for maize and beans (Castellanos et al., 2018). Expected agricultural
losses are especially concerning in the departments that are part of the Central
American Dry Corridor, where there have been agricultural output reductions, due
to severe droughts aggravated by the ENSO effects (WFP, 2019a). For instance, in
2019, extreme droughts caused 500,000 people in the Guatemalan Central
American Dry Corridor to suffer from food insecurity, and the longer dry spells
affected up to 80% of subsistence agricultural production (WFP, 2019b; Valencia,
2022). 
Climate variability and extreme weather events are not only affecting staple crops,
but also key cash crops such as coffee, bananas, cardamom and sugar cane, which
translates into economic losses and less employment opportunities for seasonal
workers in larger plantations (Tucker et al., 2010; Olivera et al., 2021; Luna, 2022).
The lack of availability and access to water is a critical factor leading to low
productivity and crop losses (Milan & Ruano, 2014). Similarly, rising temperatures
are also negatively affecting crops by altering the optimal elevation of certain cash
crops such as coffee and increasing the risk of plant pests and diseases, such as
coffee leaf rust (Avelino et al., 2015). Between 2012 and 2013, coffee leaf rust
affected up to 70% of the total coffee production and led to more than 75,000 job
losses in Guatemala (ICO, 2013). Lower incomes also have implications for the
ability of households to allocate resources towards the acquisition of fertilizers and
livestock, creating a negative feedback loop and curtailing adaptive strategies
(Baumeister, 1993; Rivera Lima, 2022). Furthermore, extreme weather events also
have negative impacts on food and livelihood security by affecting directly crops,
farms and transport infrastructure, increasing food production costs and disrupting
the food supply chain (Hellin et al., 2017; Pons, 2021). This has led in some cases to
rises in food prices, affecting urban households, reducing their purchasing power
and food affordability (Milan & Ruano, 2014). 
Cash and staple crops losses and failed harvests, intensified during the mid-
summer drought period, lead to insufficient food reserves to meet the daily
nutritional needs (WFP, 2022). For instance, between June and September 2022, it
was estimated that 4.6 million people suffered from acute food insecurity in the
country, due to droughts and changes in rainfall patterns (IPC, 2022). Children and
women show higher rates of malnutrition and are found to encounter a greater
number of adverse outcomes resulting from food insecurity (Vargas et. al, 2017;
MSPAS, 2017). For instance, children are especially vulnerable to certain coping
mechanisms, such as changing dietary elements during food shortages (OCHA,
2023; Barba-Escoto et al., 2020). Similarly, a quick gender analysis conducted by  
OCHA (2023) evidenced gendered differences on food insecurity rates related to
climate-impacts on agricultural outputs.  
The increasing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events and climate
variability can also have a negative impact on land quality in the country. Changes
in precipitation patterns, which can be exacerbated by ENSO, are one of the main
reasons for land degradation in Guatemala, as dry spells contribute to
desertification and torrential rains result in land erosion (MARN  et  al., 2021). Since 
Climate Security and Human Mobility Pathway Analysis: Guatemala        11
Page 13:
2007, arable land in Guatemala has decreased significantly, which is also negatively
impacted by tropical storms and hurricanes affecting crops and farming
infrastructure (Waddick, 2017). This situation is especially alarming in the
Guatemalan Dry Corridor, where prolonged dry spells and soil aridity have
decreased agricultural productivity and, consequently, food security (WFP, 2019b).
Similarly, climate variability has contributed to pasture degradation, affecting
communities living off livestock, and especially those who use double purpose
cattle systems (Hernandez et al., 2019). In the main areas of cattle farming, such as
Petén, pasture degradation has produced important economic losses, decreasing
milk production between 7 to 34 per cent and beef production between 13 to 41
per cent (Betancourt & Pezo, 2007). 
Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns have repercussions on forests leading
to soil degradation and creating favorable conditions for the reproduction of pests,
such as the pine bark tree, also known as gorgojo del pino (Cervantes-Martínez et
al., 2019). Located in the region with the fastest deforestation rates in the world,
Guatemala reports a deforestation rate of 60,000 ha per year - a net annual loss
rate of 1% forest cover (FAO, 2022; FAO & Banco Mundial, 2012; Sales et al., 2016).
Deforested areas are more vulnerable to landslides and soil erosion, which is
especially problematic in the south and center of the country (ECLAC et al., 2018).
As availability and access to suitable lands for agriculture and cattle farming are
affected by increasing climate variability, dependence on forestry resources and
forested land increases, producing additional pressures on forest ecosystems,
already threatened by climate change (Medina et al., 2023). 
 
The availability and accessibility of water sources has also been affected by
increasing climate variability, which is particularly alarming considering that 70 per
cent of the main economic activities contributing to GDP are dependent on access
to water (MARN et al., 2021). Changes in rainfall patterns exacerbate issues around
water availability, particularly during more intense and prolonged drought episodes
linked to ENSO, strongly affecting the west-central highlands, north Petén and the
departments located in the Central American Dry Corridor (USAID, 2017). Two river
basins constitute the main water scarcity hotspots in the country: the María Linda
basin, categorized as stressed and the Mopán-Hondo basins, where the local
population depend on a lake to avoid absolute scarcity conditions (Imbach et al.,
2015).  
Population growth in Guatemala, expected to be the highest in the Central
American region by 2100 with a 2.3% rate, will create additional pressures on water
availability per capita (Bárcena et al., 2013). Although current rates do not show a
low water per capita rate, the unequal distribution across geographies and society
is a crucial factor that mediates the exacerbating impact that climate change will
progressively have on water availability in the country (Bárcena et al., 2013). Water

Page 2:
Mozambique has approximately 45% of its population living below the
poverty line and additionally is amongst the most climatically challenged
countries. With approximately 80% of its population relying on subsistence
agriculture, this sector is the cornerstone of the country’s economy.
Cropland areas are interspaced with forests and shrubland (Figure 1),
spanning limited regions across the southern coastal area, the central
Manica province, the western part of Sofala, as well as the coastal part of
Zambezia, Nampula and Cabo Delgado in the north (Figure 2). The majority
of Mozambique’s cropland is dedicated to growing staple crops such as rice,
maize, sorghum, and cassava, all of which rely on key climatic conditions for
productivity. Recently, the rise in extreme climatic events such as floods,
drought and severe heat have strained agricultural resources, making it
challenging for farmers to maintain their livelihoods ( 1). Sofala province,
mostly acclimated for maize production often faces climate-induced
challenges such as more frequent and extreme drought and flood events,
affecting food security and the people’s livelihoods. INTRODUCTION

Systems analysis to support WFP regional action on climate resilience for MozambiqueMozambique is predominantly a summer rainfall region that experiences
considerable inter-annual climate variability. Such variability, characterized
by seasonal precipitation anomalies is primarily influenced by regional
climate drivers such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian
Ocean Dipole (IOD), or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) ( 2 , 6). ENSO,
characterized by the periodic warming (El Niño) and cooling (La Niña) of sea
surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, can lead to droughts or
excessive rainfall in different parts of Mozambique ( 2 , 7). Similarly, the Indian
Ocean Dipole (IOD), which refers to the temperature gradient between the
eastern and western Indian Ocean, affects monsoon patterns and rainfall
distribution, impacting agricultural activities. Additionally, the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO), a fluctuation in atmospheric pressure over the North
Atlantic region, influences winter climate variability, potentially leading to
extreme weather events like storms and prolonged periods of rainfall or
droughts ( 7). Together with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a long-
lived El Niño-like oscillatory pattern of climate variability based on switching
ocean temperature anomalies, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)
which represents low-frequency ocean cycle as well as solar activity changes
(SUN), these large-scale climate drivers and their interactions shape
Mozambique’s long-term climate variabilities and extremes (Figure 3).REGIONAL CLIMATE DRIVERS In terms of climate-related risks, Mozambique is one of the most exposed
African countries. The country is characterized by a tropical to sub-tropical
climate. With its extensive coastline supporting over 60% of its population,
Mozambique is highly vulnerable to tropical cyclones and flooding. The
country is also very prone to extreme hydrological events such as droughts
which is compounded by low water infrastructure and a lack of monitoring
systems ( 2 , 3). Weather extremes including droughts, floods and cyclones
frequently result in severe disasters in Mozambique, hampering the
country’s economy which is heavily reliant on rain-fed agriculture and thus
amplifying its climate-sensitivity ( 1 , 4). Central Mozambique, in particular the
Urema river sub-basin, experienced severe impacts from the 2019 tropical
cyclone Idai. This event resulted in heavy flooding with more than 30,000
people severely affected and a substantial loss of wildlife in a region
classified as a key biodiversity area ( 5).

PAST, CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE
VULNERABILITIES
Mozambique has experienced discernible shifts in climate patterns, leading
to adverse impacts to communities, livelihoods and environmental
degradation. This region is highly vulnerable to climate-induced shocks and
crises, with cyclones, floods and droughts being the most prominent
occurrences. In particular, the Urema river sub-basin area is currently highly
vulnerable to flooding, but also shows the highest risk of drought and heat
within Mozambique (Figure 4, a), making it a hotspot of compound climate
hazards (Figure 4, b). These conditions are expected to worsen in the future
with increased risk of drought, heat and flood events (Figure 4, a). Notably,
heightened vulnerability to drought and heat events is observed along the
Eastern Coast with a concentration in Central Mozambique and Sofala
province under future conditions (Figure 4, a).
Page 6:
We can also expect an incremental increase in flood events across the
entirety of Mozambique under future conditions, but particularly along the
Western part of Mozambique (Figure 4, a).
The compound impact of these climate-related hazards such as
simultaneous droughts and heatwaves or floods can result in substantial
loss and damage (Figure 4, b) ( 8). The greatest exposure to compound
hazards currently occurs in the Western to Central and Southern region of
Mozambique but has a substantial regional spread with a nucleus on the
coastline in future (Figure 4, b). All of Mozambique will be subject to medium
to high-risk compound hazards in future (Figure 4, b).
Figure 4: baseline (1980-2010) and future (2020-2040) climate hazards including
drought, heat, flood (a) and compound hazards (b). Compound hazards are
considered as the composite risk of heat, drought, and flood to determine the
cumulative impact of multiple hazards. An ensemble of 27 general circulation
models from different modelling centres globally is used to develop the indices.
Climate data are sourced from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP6). The climate pathway with high radiative forcing (SSP585) was used for the
future climate projection.

Page 7:
The agricultural sector is highly gendered, with women accounting for the
majority of the labour force. In 2019, the sector employed 80% of female
labour force ( 9). Gender equity disparities are evident across various regions
in Mozambique (Figure 5). Sofala is characterized by the lowest level of
gender equity, with Nampula, Manica also displaying relatively lower levels of
gender equity, followed by Tete and Gaza. Although these regions
demonstrate comparatively lower levels of gender equity, they still fall within
the medium range on a global scale (Figure 5). Provinces with the highest
gender equity include Inhambane, Maputo, Zambezia and Niassa (Figure 5).  
These spatial variations in gender equity highlight the need for targeted
interventions to promote equal opportunities. In regions where gender
disparities are more pronounced, focused interventions aimed at enhancing
access to education, resources and market opportunities could play a
pivotal role in fostering greater gender parity. 
Moreover, discrepancies such as market access add to the challenges faced
by the communities to efficiently build climate change resilience. Nampula
and Zambezia provinces display the lowest level of proximity to market
indicating a market isolation, increasing the cost of inputs and
transportation for farmers (Figure 6). The profound impacts of climate
change, coupled with limited resilience and heightened vulnerability of these
populations to environmental shocks needs to be considered when planning
Ecosystem-Based Adaptation and Nature-Based Solutions approaches.SOCIO-ECONOM IC VULNERABILITIES

CLIM ATE SM ART SYSTEM S USING
NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS
Based on the climate and socio-ecological risk assessment, several zones
can be identified which exhibit high risk of compound events and low coping
capacity (Figure 7). While multiple regions of Mozambique experience
different combinations of risk, these hotspots occur within Zambezia,
Nampula, Tete as well as Sofala and Maputo. Sofala has a particular
exposure to some of the highest compound risks (Figure 7, zone 2). There is
a high risk of both coastal and riverine flooding due to periods of intense
rainfall and to the impacts of tropical cyclones. Being a low-lying coastal
area, it is vulnerable to compound flood events occurring from combinations
of fluvial, pluvial and coastal drivers ( 1 0). Following recurring devastating
floods, there is a growing awareness locally of the necessity to implement
climate adaptation measures. Adding to the devastating impact of flooding,
drought events are also more recurrent in Sofala. With the projected
increase in the frequency of heat waves over this province (Figure 2),
projection of the compound effects of climate hazards shows an alarming
climate future requiring urgent and more sustainable adaptation and
mitigation strategies, such as integrated water resource management and
ecosystem-based solutions. 
In addition to the climate-induced biophysical impacts, adaptation strategies
should also place socio-economic vulnerabilities front and centre within the
region, in order to address the high gender disparities and low market
access for livelihood systems in the Urema river basin (Figure 5, 6). The
development of targeted climate-smart agricultural systems which foster
regenerative agriculture and protection of riverine systems should be
prioritized. The practices should be tailored to achieve sustainable and
equitable climate action by promoting positive peace and creating shared
values. Additionally, a focus on nature-based solutions can be used to foster
cooperation on natural resource management by promoting joint decision-
making, encouraging sustainable practices, and facilitating knowledge
sharing among diverse stakeholders, ultimately reducing conflicts over
scarce natural resources, and enhancing community resilience. Furthermore,
by ensuring that marginalised and vulnerable groups, such as women, youth
and ethnic minorities have access to resources, technologies, and decision-
making processes, nature-based solutions can contribute to dismantling the
systemic barriers that perpetuate social inequalities and exclusion in climate
action.

Climate Security Hotspots and Food Security InsightsHIGHLIGHTS
Kenya grapples with climate change challenges, experiencing erratic weather
patterns, prolonged droughts, and floods that significantly limit agricultural
productivity and natural resources availability. This not only exacerbates
food insecurity, impacting Kenyan economy, but also heightens the potential
for conflicts. The Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs), especially northern
counties like Turkana, are particularly vulnerable, and frequently experience
a surge in climate-induced food shortages compounded by escalating
conflict risks. 
The hotspots analysis presented in this factsheet highlights the critical
convergence of extreme climate and conflict events, coupled with various
food insecurity indicators. Alarmingly, counties such as Turkana, Tana River,
and Lamu exhibit a co-occurrence of high conflict, drought stress, and poor-
to-borderline Food Consumption Scores (FCS). Mandera, Meru, and Kajiado
report crisis or emergency levels of reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI),
aligning with both climatic stresses and conflict risks. Examination of crisis-
to-emergency Livelihood Coping Strategies (LCS) and the percentage of
individuals in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3 and
above reveals severe situations in counties like Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera,
Garissa, Wajir, Tana River, and Isiolo, compounded by escalating conflict
risks and drought stress. Specific regions, including Turkana, Marsabit,
Mandera, and Wajir, persistently grapple with high conflict and severe
drought, presenting ongoing challenges. Notably, Turkana emerges as the
most vulnerable, marked by borderline FCS, emergency rCSI, and a
significant share of population facing alarming food security phases. 
The World Food Programme (WFP) in Kenya plays a crucial role in addressing
the complex interplay of climate change, food insecurity, and peace through
targeted interventions. These interventions encompass climate-resilient
agricultural practices, conflict-sensitive food distribution, and community-
based resilience-building initiatives. The primary aim of this factsheet is to
provide a climate security perspective on the ground-level food insecurity
data collected by WFP, assessing the alignment of WFP intervention
priorities with climate security hotspots. The analysis serves as an
informative tool for WFP, indicating the need to reassess target areas or
incorporate new ones in response to climate-related security risks.
Additionally, it helps identify various data gaps, contributing to the
enhancement of data collection efforts.

The global community has already recognized the importance of peace and
stability for sustainable and resilient food systems. Yet, these systems
encounter challenges extending beyond the realm of violent conflict. Diverse
factors impede the productivity and inclusivity of food systems, particularly
affecting marginalized populations and hindering their capacity to ensure
widespread access to nutritious diets. Among others, environmental stress
compounds these challenges, posing a significant threat to both lives and
livelihoods. This heightened environmental pressure often leads to climate-
induced food shortages, exacerbating the ongoing food insecurity situations.
This pattern becomes particularly problematic in fragile settings, where food
insecurity is not only a consequence of increasing conflict risks but also a
contributing factor to the emergence and duration of such crises [1].
Kenya, like many other regions, is grappling with the multifaceted challenges
posed by climate change, including erratic weather patterns, prolonged
droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. In the northern counties, for
instance, these shifting climatic patterns have significantly compromised
water storage capacity and infrastructure, thereby leading to substantial
economic losses, particularly within the livestock and agricultural sectors [2].
Such a changing climate has a profound negative impact on productivity and
natural resource availability, consequently exacerbating food insecurity [3].
Among the most affected are pastoral communities in the Arid and Semi-Arid
Lands (ASALs), particularly in marginalized cross-border agricultural areas,
where a staggering 3.1 million people grappled with food insecurity in early
2022 [4]. A combination of factors - including the five consecutive seasons
of below-average rainfall culminating in El Niño flooding during the 2023
short rain season, diminished crop and livestock production, localized
conflicts, and soared food prices - has further contributed to the escalating
levels of food insecurity among these vulnerable populations [5]. 
Given these circumstances, a primary challenge lies in acknowledging the
intricate relationships at play and strategically planning well-informed
interventions to bolster food security and foster sustainable livelihoods in
vulnerable communities. An assessment of areas where climate and conflict
events co-occur, coupled with comprehensive food security data, may serve
as a critical tool for the World Food Programme (WFP) in Kenya. CLIMATE, CONFLICT AND FOOD
SECURITY IN KENYA
Climate Security Hotspots and Food Security Insights

Figures 1-4 depict various combinations of climate, conflict, and food
insecurity indicators across Kenya. The climate-conflict dynamics explored
include all conflict clusters (high, moderate, and low conflict) combined with
all drought levels (high, moderate, and low drought), high conflict clusters
combined with all drought levels, and high drought stress level combined
with all conflict clusters. The food security indicators examined encompass
Food Consumption Score (FCS), reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI),
Livelihood Coping Strategies (LCS), and Integrated Food Security Phase
Classification. 
Figure 1 illustrates the co-occurrence of conflict dynamics and climate
conditions, alongside poor and borderline Food Consumption Score (FCS).
Notably, counties experiencing the simultaneous presence of high conflict
and high-to-low drought stress predominantly exhibit poor and borderline
FCS. Turkana, Tana River, and Lamu, in particular, stand out as the most
food-insecure counties - as evidenced by their poor and borderline FCS
scores - grappling with severe heat stress and high conflict. Exploring the
different climate security hotspots, in Turkana they include Nakalale,
Kakuma, Letea, Lopur, Songot, Turkwel, Kanamkemer, Kang’Atotha, Lodwar
Township, Kalobeyei, Kaaleng/Kaikor, Kibish and Lokichoggio wards. These
wards report disparities in nutrition, inequality and resource availability,
consistent with the overall county situation. According to MoALFC (2021),
Turkana is ranked as the third county in Kenya in terms of poverty levels,
with an estimated 87.5% of people living below the poverty line. The county
is also significantly affected by dry spells that often result in drying water
sources, starving livestock, and resource-based conflicts [6]. Climate change
impacts and security concerns primarily impact children below 5 years,
women, youth, pastoralists and fishing communities. The most severely
affected wards (hotspots) in the county (those in the high conflict-high
drought stress category) are Nakalale, Kakuma, Letea, Lopur and Songot. In
Tana River county, Sala and Madogo wards present co-occurrence of high
conflict and drought stress. Lastly, in Lamu county  an intersection of high
conflict and moderate drought stress occurs in Hindi, Mkomani, Mkunumbi,
Shella and Basuba wards.HOTSPOTS INSIGHTSThis information can empower WFP to craft targeted and effective
interventions for vulnerable areas and communities. This integrated
approach - namely the combination of climate, conflict, and food insecurity
data over space and time - can facilitate the anticipation and mitigation of
climate-induced food crises, thereby contributing building resilience and
advancing sustainable and conflict-sensitive food systems.

Figure 2 presents the co-occurrence of climate security hotspots overlaid
with stressed and crisis/emergency reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI)
levels. According to the rCSI, Turkana, Mandera, Tana River, Meru, and
Kajiado are currently at emergency level. Considering the co-occurrence
both FCS and rCSI, along with the co-occurrence of both climatic stresses
and conflict risks, Turkana and Tana River continue to face an alarming
situation. In the case of Kajiado, cases of moderate conflict and high-to-low
drought conditions are reported in Dalalekutuk, Ildamat, Imaroro, Kaputiei
North, Iloodokilani, Keekonyokie, Matapato South and Entonet/Lenkisim
wards.  Simultaneously, Meru exhibits the following climate security
hotspots (high-to-moderate conflict and high-to-low drought conditions):
Karama, Muthara, Athwana and Kianjai wards. Mandera’s hotspots are
located at: Elwak South, Kutulo, Shimbir Fatuma, Arabia, Bulla Mpya,
Khalalio, Neboi, Township wards.
Figure 3 displays the co-occurrence of climate security hotspots along with

Marsabit, Mandera, Garissa, Wajir, and Isiolo. As previously highlighted,
these counties experience different forms of co-occurrence of high-to-
moderate conflict with different drought conditions. While Turkana and
Mandera showcase high conflict and hight-to-moderate drought conditions
hotspots (the wards are the ones listed in the previous sections), Garissa,
Wajir, and Isiolo report the following: high conflicts and moderate-high
drought stress in Balambala, Garissa Township, Eldas, Tarbaj, Wajir East,
Wajir South, Wajir West, Elnur/Tula Tula, Tarbaj, Barwago, Township,
Wagberi, Ibrahim Ure, Lagboghol South and Ganyure/Wagalla wards.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In recent years, climate variability and escalating conflict risks have become
significant concerns in various Kenyan counties. The hotspots depicted in
Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 consider both deteriorating climatic conditions and
instances of conflict, pinpointing locations (at 20 km2) that have been
severely impacted by the interplay of these two factors.

From 2017 to 2022, specific regions in Kenya consistently grappled with
both high conflict and severe drought, presenting significant challenges for
the local population, including increasing resource scarcity, violence, and
weakening rainfed-related agricultural livelihoods. These areas include
Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, Mandera, Garissa, Samburu, Isiolo, Wajir, Laikipia,
Baringo, Tana River, Lamu, Narok, and Mombasa. Notably, among these
counties, Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Tana River, Garissa, Isiolo, and
Lamu stand out as particularly vulnerable to an increasing convergence of
climate-related security risks, specifically concerning high conflict and high
drought indicators.
While the overall food security situation in the ASALs has shown
improvement over time, certain specific areas continue to grapple with
significant food insecurity challenges. From 2017 to 2022, Turkana, Tana
River, Marsabit, Mandera, Garissa, and Wajir consistently report alarming
food insecurity indicators, particularly with respect to the reduced Coping
Strategies Index (rCSI) and the percentage of the population in a crisis or
emergency food insecurity IPC phase. 
The synthesis of these insights underscores the complex interplay of climate
variability, conflict risks, and food insecurity. While causality is not implied,
this analysis clearly demonstrates how, under certain context-specific
circumstance, - including the increasing frequency of extreme weather
events, the high dependence on rainfed agriculture, and a rapidly growing
population - the convergence of climatic and socio-economic factors can
give rise to localized vicious cycles of vulnerability, emphasizing the
importance of spatial autocorrelation – a concept suggesting that
“Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related
than distant things.”[7]. Consequently, the positive spatial dependence of
climate variability, conflict risks, and food insecurity may suggest a
reinforcing dynamic when combined in a specific context, creating a pressing
need for humanitarian assistance and sustainable development initiatives.
Improving data collection is essential to grasp the intricate dynamics of
climate variability, conflict risks, and food insecurity in Kenya. Addressing
some of the identified data gaps – such as the limited granularity of food
security information, and the constraints of conflict data provided by event-
based datasets - requires advanced satellite imagery for real-time insights,
on-the-ground assessments involving local communities, and collaboration
with governments for access to relevant data.

Utilizing technologies like remote sensing and GIS can enhance accuracy and
timeliness. These refined data collection methods are crucial for informed
strategies, aiding organizations like the World Food Programme in
developing targeted interventions to tackle the multifaceted challenges
faced by vulnerable communities in Kenya.
The World Food Programme can play a pivotal role by focusing on these
high-risk areas, contributing to enhanced food security for the most
vulnerable populations in Kenya. This may involve targeted interventions,
such as the provision of climate-resilient agricultural practices, conflict-
sensitive food distribution strategies, and community-led resilience-building
initiatives.

APPENDIX
Definitions
Climate clusters describe a range of suitable to adverse climate condition,
based on six agro-climatic indicators. The adverse climate cluster is
characterized, among others, by low precipitation, and high to moderate
climate water deficit. The terminology in the figures refers to high,
moderate, and low drought stress. High drought stress is characterized by
low values of precipitation (multi-annual median) of 239.27 mm, high-
moderate values of climate water deficit (multi-annual median) of 1402.87
mm, moderate-low values of actual evapotranspiration (multi-annual
median) of 164.79 mm, high values of number of days with ratio of actual to
potential evapotranspiration ratio below 0.5 (multi-annual median) of 175.74
number of days), low values of number of days with ratio of actual to
potential evapotranspiration ratio below 0.5 (multi-annual coefficient of
variation) (0.05 proportion), low values of number of days with waterlogging
(multi-annual median) (0 number of days). Climate data covers years ranging
from 1990 until 2022.
